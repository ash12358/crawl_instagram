We made a random stop to stretch, get some snacks, and catch whatever we can as the light was fading for the night. This family helped in everyway.

Day Tripping with the young man means that i am switching up Portraits, and lofty landscape aspirations for quick Street Photography. I can get lost for hours in a small series of shots, and that is just not what i want to do now.  Not with him, and certainly not to be disconnected from him for any prolonged period of time, as i get lost in my zone.  And that is more me than him,  i can leave him alone and he will find a way to occupy himself. Which, is a very long winded way to say, that i am going to practice B&W, gritty, choice of life images that i hope convey what i am imprinted on when i get up everyday this week to navigate this area. I will also throw in some other B&W shots from previous excursions, in between processing each day's collection. #france #bwphotography #travel #streetstyle #streetphotography #frenchbeach #travel #travelphotography #loversintheopen #oldlove

A bit late for Throwback Thursday. However... 4 years ago in Trinidad,  these ladies, and more, honoured us by giving us a week of their time to see the country I grew up in.

Known for the Sichuan (Szechuan) pepper and some of the hottest, spicier dishes in the world,  the cuisine is more diverse and one of the best culinary locations in China, and the World in my opinion. There is a diverse and plentiful proliferation of street food, and small brick and mortar restaurants which expands their capacity via temporarily taking over sidewalks, and if necessary, the street. This was taken after a weekday lunch rush. #streetfood #china #chengdu #chengdulife #sichuan #szechuan #blackandwhite #blackandwhitephotography #streetphotography #streetphoto_bw  #travelphotography

Today is my birthday, and it is really among the worst I have had emotionally in many, many years. So I am going to find my happy place and post something that I was not going to after my flurry of the little man's images on social media recently. I will get my hug from my son when I pick him up in a few hours, and that will correct most of my ails. Until then... #namaste #thatface #hug #thathairtho #itsawesome #hesawesome #besos

1 year, 11 months and 25 days. The video was a last minute addition, cause I got caught up in this memory from last year. This was the beginning of a shorthand we now use to make the other smile. I don't know how long it will last, but it is awesome that I have this to go back to view when Bing Bong dies. #BoomNoBoom

Thought the horses were more reminiscent of goats as they would eat anything, like this one was chomping on the wooden post that had barbwire that was strung around it and the fence of barbwire that it was holding.

Was So Excited when we purchased this piece on our last stay in Orlando, but was recently told that shipping will be $900 plus from @ups to get it from Orlando to NYC? We had similar sized pieces shipped from Australia, Japan and Belgium and none of those came near in that kind of cost, and that included dealing with US Customs! I am posting this, as an emotional farewell to a piece I was excited about, if @dhlus can not save the sale. I much rather see that money go into the artist pocket than evaporate for obscene shipping costs.  Fingers crossed for the news tomorrow. Either Way, please check out this young talented artist. #kessler #kesslercollection #grandbohemian #grandbohemiangallery #grandbohemiangalleryorlando #blackisbeautiful #orlando #orlandoart #orlandoartist #petersonguerrier

Day Five - Lather,  Rinse, Repeat I did this set from the Vestrahorn Mountains, with it gorgeous black sand beach that had the snow capping the little mini dunes, which were formed by the wind. It was one of my favourite visuals when driving the ring road,  and would be just the sight where I was hoping to use to capture the Aurora Borealis. Which was not meant to be. Even though we got there just after the Golden Hour, it was still beautiful. I do regret not taking the harbour photos at nearby Hofn, good food and lovely sight at night. #iceland #icelandtrip #stokksnes #stokksnesbeach #vestrahornmountains #vestrahorn #landscape #landscapephotography #blacksandbeach #blacksand

Day four ~ it gets faster from here. DIAMOND BEACH & The GLACIER LAGOON Formed in 1935, Jökulsárlón is a glacial lagoon, bordering Vatnajökull National Park in southeastern Iceland. Its still, blue waters are dotted with icebergs from the surrounding Breiðamerkurjökull Glacier, part of larger Vatnajökull Glacier. The Glacier Lagoon flows through a short waterway into the Atlantic Ocean, leaving chunks of ice on a black sand beach #iceland #icelandtrip #jokulsarlon #jökulsárlón #jokulsarlonglacierlagoon #diamondbeach #iceberg #icebergs  #vatnajökull #vatnajökullnationalpark #vatnajökullglacier #vatnajokullglacier #landscapephotographer #landscapephotography  #icelandphotography #icelandlandscape #icelandgoldencircle #hofn #höfn #breiðamerkurjökull #breidamerkurjokull #breiðamerkurjökullglacier

Thanksgiving: FRIENDS Communications have always been My weakpoint. I internalize more than express. It is not acceptable, especially with those I care about. However... on this day, in this season. Allow me to say,  thank you.

"Orlando Sunsets are like Dali paintings" Years ago when I lived in Orlando, I was professing my love for Orlando's sky, and in particular the sunsets. He described it as "Dali-esque". I couldn't agree with him more. Quick in and out of Orlando to make sure the Ole Lady is in good shape for the end of year, as I will be heading out of the country for circa 2 weeks over the upcoming holidays. Expect some multiple posts on Orlando, both old and new. #orlando #sunset #orlandosunset #dali #salvadordali #paintingstyle #stillaphoto #momvisit #latentazionedisantantonio Antonio

There was a road, a very strange, enchanted road. It used to run from Kashgar all the way to Tashkorgan, which is the final, Chinese city before the Pakistan border, all within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China However, power is king, and in order tosupply power to the infrastructure that the Government needs for it planned expansion, they built a Dam. Progress has it casualties. First,  The nomadic, minority Kazaks were gathered and relocated to permanent housing. Second, they have completed sectioned off a portion of the river and made this tremendous lake, and in doing so built a new highway to replace this road. This image is of the road that was left behind.  It now leads to nowhere, as just it crumbles into the lake.

Still exploring Yunnan province. Tiger Leaping Gorge, named so after a legend that says that in order to escape from a hunter, a tiger jumped across the river at the narrowest point (still 25 metres (82 ft) wide). At a maximum depth of approximately 3,790 meters (12,434 feet) from river to mountain peak, Tiger Leaping Gorge is one of the deepest and most spectacular river canyons in the world, as well as being home to the localized and overall minority group called the NAXI ( nah- shi). Natural crystals are mined from areas in and surrounding the Tiger Leaping Gorge This photo is a view of the gorge from the high path, showing Jade Dragon Snow Mountainon the left, and Haba Xueshan on the right. #tigerleapinggorge #yunnan #deqing #tigerleapinggorgehike #China

Shaxi is located in a valley surrounded by mountains and the wider area includes a number of villages It was a key trading hub on the Tea Horse Trail which links Southern Yunnan to Tibet and India, and retains its position as one of the best preserved historic market hubs today. Honestly, there is little to do there. And a majority of it populous is at an advanced age. But so are the buildings, and for very small fee, you may take a tour of a home that has been around for 100 years. China has gone through a lot in 100 years. At the sametime, not very much has changed Plus. This CAT is just a BOSS #china #yunnan #shaxi #cannotstandcigarettesmoke #lovewatchingcigarettesmokers #Moviesareinfluencial

Yubeng Village （Chinese name: 雨崩村） of Yunling Country, Deqin County in Yunnan Province, means a gathering place of Jewry in Tibetan language. Due to no highway to access Yubeng village, one can only get there by trekking or horse-riding for 18 kilometers, and crossing over a pass for 3700 meters Yubeng village has a unique geographical environment with only some 30 resident families and one way access to the outside world. This image is the son of the owner of the hostel (the only way to have accommodations in Yubeng) We stayed there for 2 or 3 nights, but beauty does not begin to describe landscape.

Thank you @google._.photos for reminding me that we took this diving vacation on the Great Barrier Reef. Here is the thing. Sheryl is o lover of Diving- and she planned every aspect this vacation. Then we found out that she was pregnant and could not dive. Which was unfortunate, though it was cool having a final vacation with  us just being lovers.

This lovely little lady was just outside of the temple, with her father who was selling freshly cut vegetables and fruit bowls that people would consume in the shade of a tree. She was cutting and preparing them before presentation. I love her, as she called me over to sit next to her as I was waiting and stopped all the other kids from pressuring me to purchase anything, which resulted in me just having fun with them all and eventually taking to their photos. This little princess was my saviour in Fatehpur.

The Marracas salesperson. The bustling technique is persistent, agressive, and ever present. That is not to say rude or physical. This cat invested a lot of time and patience to get me to purchase something. But he refused multiple times to take money for nothing. He insisted that I PURCHASE something.

Looks like I am in India for the next 10 days. 1st 2 days are in Delhi, next few posts... Old Delhi. Jama Masjid is one of the largest Mosques in India. Same emperor behind the Taj Mahal built this one. Was here just before Friday prayer, but totally present for the oppressive humidity and heat. So, got that going for me.

In speaking with many locals and expats, there is a legitimate concern for the safety of the participants of the #gaypride event tomorrow.  Especially in the epicentre. Which is why that is where you would find them.  They understand the potential consequences of their decisions.  Which is why it is all the more important and moving. #love #unity #gay #gaypride2017 #gaypridemadrid #ThisIsABusStopAD #mademehappy #mademeproud  #pride #worldpride #spain #madrid

In my over 4 decades of living, it took this Trini till last week to know that the day after a Winter storm is always cooler than the day of.

What was to be our last day was infact our penultimate as a blizzard came in and shut down all travel in and out of the park. Sheryl missed a day of important work that was to be the culmination of days upon weeks of preparation. However, it is hard to complain where this is where we were when the storm hit. A bit better than when I was stuck in an airport somewhere. Thank you to the #snowlodge for quickly taking care of us, and getting a room immediately prepared for our son to get his nap, and making the event as painless as possible.

Morning Glory Pool is a hot spring in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. The pool was named by Mrs E. N. McGowan, wife of Assistant Park Superintendent, Charles McGowan in 1883. She called it "Convolutus", the Latin name for the morning glory flower, which the spring resembles. By 1889, the name Morning Glory Pool had become common usage in the park. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Glory_Pool #personallyithinkitlookslikeaneye

Pt.2 of 3... Bad Daddy. Boy is exhausted, it is his nap time, and instead of complaining, he just knocked out in my back. Awesome Kid - 1, Shitty Dad - 0.

Final day and we thought to do a couple of miles in the beautiful snow. Then a pregnant Bison walked in the trail, so we had to find a way around her.... Pt.1 of 3...

I have developed a ridiculous love affair for the Bison. While the Bison is interchangeably called Buffalo here in the States, which is due to the fact people found that they resembled the Asian Buffalo, they are actually genetically closer related to the American Cow more than the though of Asian Buffalo. #TheycallthemMRBison #Lovethesecreatures #donttellmywife #bison #yellowstonenationalpark #yellowstone

Little man got sick today. Been throwing up and just as bad in the diapers. Through it all, he still has a smile for us. He missed his dinner feeding, just wanting to have his mother next to him. Before I left to handle laundry from the day's events, they both fell asleep on one another. Sometimes your heart melts because they are yours. Sometimes it melts because they are so cute. Sometimes... It just melts. We fly home tomorrow.

NYCC 2016 - Sunday A Final Note. As @newyorkcomiccon wrapped, I leave this as my final image. What I love about this culture, this event, is that it does not matter what you are before you walk through the doors. It is about your enthusiasm, love and openness to share and accept it. #ilovegeeks #newyorkcomiccon #newyorkcomiccon2016 #nycc2016 #nycc #startrek  #startrekbeyond  #pride #jaylah  #whyilovegeekculture #acceptance #safeplace #bewhoyouare  #bewhatyouwant #bewhatyoulove #sheisbeautiful #cosplay #nycccosplay #newyorkcomicconcosplay

NYCC 2016 - Friday Wonder Woman Diversity does not just mean black. I initially approached this lovely Wonder Woman as she was in a mobile chair and when I asked to take her picture, had her companion fetch her shield.

"...weep like Alexander when he wanted other worlds to conquer.." Yesterday however, was not that day. Yesterday, NYC yielded yet another gem for us to discover and roam. In art and culinary taste and warehouse hip vibe.  Yesterday, we discovered Roberta's. (Thanks to @Netflix Chef's Table), and the beauty of the neighbour it is in. Yesterday we discovered, Bushwick. We were far from the first to visit, it will not be our last visit. PS... Ichiran Ramen (https://m.facebook.com/ichiranny/) is coming there as well.

Soon... Moving back part 1. Move 1 of 3 completed. It is cool seeing items that was placed in storage 4 years ago. Like a mini time capsule of memories from the recent past. Up next. China shipments part 1 and 2.
