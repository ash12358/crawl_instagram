It’s with a heavy heart that we share the news of the passing of Leo “Bud” Welch. Uncharacteristic of most professional musicians, Welch spent most of his prime as a lumberjack. Even though he started playing the blues at the age of 13 in 1945 and was offered to audition with the likes of BB King, he didn’t put out his first record until 2013 at the age of 81. Two years later he played the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival as one of the last artists representing the legendary original Mississippi Delta blues era. Thanks for the extra special experience Bud, your legacy will live on in music! | #tellurideblues

When Samantha Fish first played the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival in 2016, she won our hearts in a huge way. One song in, she kicked off her red high heels (“I’m high enough without these”), and absolutely electrified the afternoon crowd with her sizzling guitar work, soaring vocals and a red-hot band that knew no other gear than overdrive. It was nothing short of amazing and we knew without a doubt we had to invite her back. We’re excited to kick off the first of many 2017 Main Stage videos with her performance of "Nearer To You”.

Out of 24 years of spectacular performances, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings’ 2015 headlining set is one we’ll never forget. With ease, The Dap-Kings played a tight, spirited set allowing for Jones’ timeless, soulful vocals to shine through. Town Park was elevated to a higher level that evening. Tragically Sharon Jones’ passed away a year ago today, leaving us with a legacy of emotion-arousing soul, along with a set of unreleased tracks. Today, her final album “Soul of a Women” is out. We highly recommend you give it listen and consider adding it to your collection. Available at sharonjonesandthedapkings.com | #tellurideblues

WEATHER UPDATE - Due to the close proximity of lightning, we need to evacuate Telluride Town Park for the safety of the public. Campers, please return to the Campground until further notice. Festival attendees, please move into town until it is safe to reopen the park for the festival. When the storm has passed, we will reopen the festival gates.

Bonnie Raitt plays the soundtrack of Our Lives. 20 albums, 10 Grammys, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, countless gigs and other recognition... Bonnie's life has been a life of music. Listening to her voice echoing off the mountain walls last night in Telluride Town Park was a true honor.

After the music ends in Town Park for the evening, we move the festival scene into various music venues located throughout the town of Telluride. These are our "Juke Joints" and, once they get jamming, a walk down Main Street feels like a walk down Beale Street in Memphis. From jammed out performances that approach last call, to foot-stomping rock shows and legendary collaborations, the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival's Juke Joint shows are not to be missed.

"As locals know, there's seriously no bad views in Telluride.

Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy. When you hear the name Steve Winwood, where do you go? Back to Blind Faith? On the Arc of A Diver? Do you play Traffic in your head? Or do you think about the kid who was the driving force of the Spencer Davis Group? Wherever Steve Winwood’s impressive output takes you, it’s pure gold. Creatively restless and curious, the hallmark of Steve’s musical journey has been one of exploration and testing boundaries. Catch him in Telluride this September 15-17th at the 24th Annual Telluride Blues & Brews Festival.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d946cb7d1f68014de134eb858cf8b30f/5BCBE942/t51.2885-15/e35/17437733_407817806253241_3920597468076572672_n.jpg
Bonnie Raitt plays the soundtrack of our lives. Her honesty, her warmth, her been-there, felt-that songs seem to be ripped from the pages of our own diaries. Listening to her music feels like sitting down with an old friend when the blues hit hard, but the company we’re in is the best medicine. Welcome back to mountains, Bonnie.

It's so great to see hard-working musicians recognized for their efforts. Last weekend, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper proclaimed December 17th as "Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats" Day. Humbled, Rateliff took the stage to recognize the proclamation, getting on his knees while members of the band wrapped him in the Colorado flag. Congrats Nathaniel!
