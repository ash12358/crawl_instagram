Kind of obsessed with Lockhart. We spent half of our 24-hour getaway taking photos of the town and the other half looking at photos of Fitz 😅

A year ago there was finally a chance that I'd be a dad. After years of trying to have a kid, we were finally pregnant. I'm so infitely grateful for this boy. I'm excited to do my best at being a dad for him. Making fun of him crying is totally a part of that.

Who cares about political parties. Politics is about real issues, impacting real people. The good politicians are ones who care about uniting people from different frames of mind around actual, tangible things we can make better together. And I think Beto can do that. I enjoyed meeting him last year, and enjoyed supporting him tonight. Vote, vote, vote in November! 🇺🇲

It's been almost a year since this summit. I'm missing the high desert a bunch right now since we haven't been out to Marfa since December, so I'm going through photos. 😅 If you're going to West Texas this summer, and want to hike, hitting the highest peak in Texas (8900 feet) at sunset is as good as it gets. Super bonus points if you do it holding a @bigbendbrewing beer.

Fitz update: he's back stateside and learning all sorts of new skills like how to hold something, how to squeal, and how to have a sleep schedule (at night at least). My heart, it bursts with joy. ❤️

Major geek mode: we got to fly over the tip of Greenland on Monday on our Frankfurt 🛫 Austin @condorairlines flight! All that white blending into the horizon - that's the Greenland ice sheet. A lot of the ice melt happening due to climate change is happening *right here* so I was geeking about the geo tourism... I've flown over Greenland before on a more northerly transatlantic track, but never on a clear day. The whole plane rushed to the right side to see the view. 🤓❄️

I found Wes Anderson's garage. 🤓 We took a side trip to Narbonne, France, in the south along the coast, and I went roaming through streets and alleys taking shots of different textures and colors since the French are so wonderful (and different from the Spanish) at painting their buildings. 🇫🇷

Saw the real Carcassonne (not the board game) today, with maybe the best art installation I've ever seen. 💯 That's all biodegradable yellow tape.

Barcelona was great, but turns out small towns are just so much easier with a baby. We picked Girona for the last part of our trip without much thought... small city, within two hours of Barcelona, with a good Airbnb. Turns out there's all sorts of interesting history here, Roman ruins (of course, they're everywhere), and basically everyone in Europe conquered this place over the years. It's beautiful. We took this shot while on top of the old city wall.

8 years with this wonderful woman! Life is different now with Fitz, but also the same since we're working hard to keep doing what we love with a kid. I've loved every bit of this much needed vacation with both these peeps. And I can't wait for the next infinite years with both of them. At least if the flight home goes well. ♥️

We were shopping at a baby store, and in the back of the store I looked up and saw this: a series of clothes lines, with clothes drying, and the sun bouncing off the buildings as it set. When I pointed my camera at it, every line in the shot was symmetrical: vertically and diagonally. And the shades of brown, yellow, and blue made this perfect color pallette.

This town is so lovely. Small, and perfectly demonstrates healthy urban design: big roads that distribute cars to each neighborhood, but small streets shared by people and cars in the residential areas. We found an Airbnb a couple streets off the beach! 🙌

We always wanted to bring Fitz to Europe when he was a baby. Many people said traveling that far with a baby would be the worst thing ever. So when we were about to press the big scary purchase button on the airline website, we stared at it for ten whole minutes. Would it be the worst thing ever? Should we stay home where things are easier? Will he cry the whole flight? Hundreds of questions like that flooded through our heads. And then we agreed that travel is something we value, and something we want Fitz to value. He wouldn't remember this trip at all, but he could see the photos and feel like he traveled the world. And we would do something so many blogs and forums advised against. 😎 And then we clicked purchase. And then Fitz aced both flights, and has been the easiest baby ever since we got here! We are so grateful. And of course this wasn't guaranteed... he could have hated it. All babies are different, and Fitz has a very laid back personality so far. 😂

It was so nice to walk around the corner for brunch yesterday. 😀 We feel so refreshed. Five months ago we did something crazy and moved again for the second time in three years... but we love our new neighborhood, love raising Fitz here, and love having brunch on our block.

New job present 😍 I've been wanting a @ternbicycles foldable commuter bike for years, and a job that's close enough to go bike-only - and both happened this week! 😀 Grateful for @catzter for her support this week as I started a new job/bought a bike while juggling being new parents together.

Fitz and the tantrums 🎶 I know I just broke my own rule and posted another baby photo, but @catzter said I need to consider being more personal on my feed and talk about actual things happening in my life and not just posting pictures of good design and travel and buildings and beer (as if anything were more interesting than those things?). Anyway, we've almost survived our first week with Fitz! Mostly in the hospital, now home. I had no idea how intense the feelings would be becoming a parent, or that googling literally anything related to parenting would be useless (it's just like googling symptoms, you're dying no matter what). Grateful, exhausted, content. Okay there you go Instagram, eat your heart out ☺️

#tbt: I officially spent 28% of 2017 on the road, a bit lower than 2016 (32%). The big upset: I spent 24 nights in Germany, higher than 20 nights at #thenunnerymarfa. 🇩🇪 Other highlights from my 104 nights away: Lebanon, Iceland, another 15 nights in Europe, Colorado, DC, Pennsylvania, Santa Fe.

#30days30places post eleven: the Bernard Schwartz House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the 30s, April 2017. I'd never visited a FLW house, much less stayed in one - but @catzter found this one on Airbnb and we stayed for the weekend to celebrate her dad's bday! This was one of his classics, and featured everything he was known best for: natural red brick, heated red concrete floors, and mid-century design years ahead of its time. 🦄

#30days30places tenth post: this Scandanavian brunch at #brodernord in #pdx, December 2015. @catzter and I went on an ambitious weekend trip to Portland for fun, at a time with great weather (35 and raining the whole time), and all we did was eat and drink things the whole time! This was probably my fave meal. Yes that's a "breakfast negroni."

#30days30places, ninth post: this public square in the middle of Barcelona's #gothicquarter, February 2017. I had a day to get over jet lag before a busy work week, and walked all over the city - but the Gothic Quarter, a dense maze of sidewalk-width streets, is like top five for me on neighborhoods. Truly magical. Imagine letting yourself get lost in a maze of sidewalks between six-story mixed use buildings, and occasionally stumbling upon squares like this one. Europe at its finest.

#30days30places, eighth post: October 2015, Guilford, Connecticut, on the Long Island Sound. @saraaltuna took us to eat at this classically #newengland place called The Clam Castle (of course) for lobster rolls (the best). All the houses had pumpkins and wreaths and all those things that Texans like me write off as stroybook lore. I think we had chai lattes and 57 ape cider donuts to top it all off. 💯🍩🍩🍩

#30days30places, seventh post: a sunrise looking toward the East River from Manhattan's Lower East Side, January 2016. @catzter used to go to #nyc once a month for work, and I'd try to go with her as much as I could. I used to hate New York, but came to love the city on those trips - especially the more low key neighborhoods like Chelsea, the Lower East Side, and Fort Greene. After I shot this sunrise we walked to breakfast in a bunch of muddy, melting snow.

#30days30places, sixth post. February 2015, LA, exploring the Getty Museum in a cold day. Of all the things to photograph at a place like the Getty, this garden - seen from two stories above - was what I fixated on. Apparently it's what most people take pictures of too - not the sculptures, not the view of the Wilshire skyline or Santa Monica coast. The giant succulents, man.

#30days30places, fifth post: April 2016, on a really long walk all over London to try to push through jetlag (Shoreditch to Borough Market to Westminster to Chelsea to Holborn). I spotted the top of the #londoneye from above the #horseguardparade on a beautiful day! Highlights from the walk: the café at the Tate Modern, a beer beneath Southwark Bridge, and a Catholic evening service at Westminster Cathedral where the transitions between parts of the service were sung for some reason.

#30days30places, fourth post: January 2017, Pennsylvania Avenue, during the #womensmarch. The urbanist in me got really excited about these center-running, signal-controlled bike lanes - making commuting faster and safer for cyclists on one of DC's busiest diagonal streets. DC's actually doing some of the most innovative things with bike infrastructure in the US right now! Cyclists: imagine the convenience of left turns with this design.

#30days30places: third post. I shot this on a cold afternoon walk through Oxford in April 2016. I was captivated by the vines. I guess in Austin, and in much of the American West where I travel most frequently, I just don't see vines like this - and these had an added bonus of all growing in the same direction. 🌿

#30days30places, second post: evening light underneath our friends' apartment in Lebanon. The apartments in the hills above Beirut are built in steep hills - like, steeper than you think! 1000s of feet. You could see the Mediterranean in the distance. The evening light made it even better.

First #30days30places post: Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, May 2016. This was the most elaborate garden I'd ever seen... literally huge, and entirely symmetrical. We spent a few hours exploring, and found a hedge maze and a merry-go-round that we got super dizzy on!
