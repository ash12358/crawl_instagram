I’m creating a habit of getting in an early morning workout. FYI, I am NOT a morning person. But I am dedicated to making my health a priority. How is your morning routine going? #Repost @liveitdontdiet with @get_repost ・・・ Only have 40 minutes to work out? Here’s what you can do. Log on to @wellbeats and take a virtual interval cycling class. You’ll burn a LOT of calories. Then use the @fitbodapp to get in your weight lifting. 🏋🏽‍♀️ Track your workouts with @misfitwearables and then rinse and repeat.

Happy birthday to @kevinhart4real and congrats on a great set! The #Vegas #irresponsibletour brought us a brand new material. The start time of the show was on some serious CP time. Like, SERIOUS CP time. 🙄 But the show was worth waiting for. Plus, I’m going to give Kevin and the #redcupboyz a pass. Tonight was, after all, Kevin Hart’s birthday. Also note... the security was tighter than tight! Absolutely no cell phones and recording devices at the show. Don’t worry, they’ll remind you a hundred times. Not being able to use social is rather ironic given Kevin Hart’s digital footprint. 👣 But, I understand him wanting to control his material. That said, if you are going to #mgmgardenarena for the #kevinhart #irresponsibletour2018 this weekend... heed my warning and do NOT even THINK about taking photos before or during the show. I witnessed several people being escorted out... some before the show even started. Go. Enjoy. Wait until the end. The photo op will come... AFTER he’s done his set. #vegasnightlife #vegaslocal #kevinhart

Mo, the owner of Pho Bosa, said his restaurant had the best Vietnamese food in Vegas. ACTUALLY, he said Pho Bosa was THE best Vietnamese restaurant in the U.S. I can’t find the lie! @nayadatisme, it was a pleasure meeting your brother and dinning at Pho Bosa. His passion for food, his business and life in general was intoxicating! BTW, our feast was one of the best meals EVER. I’ll be back (probably after work on Friday) and I cannot wait for him to open his restaurant in Henderson! #foodporn #foodie #vegaslocal #vegaslife #vegasoffthestrip

Hanging with my longtime friend and @bet alum, @derrick4mkup. Ever wonder who gives @oprah her look? It’s this guy right here. He’s been on the road with Oprah... beating her face... for eight years. She doesn’t make a public move without him. He’s also done makeup for Michelle Obama... and women from all walks of life. Derrick and I go WAY back to our BET days. He did my makeup once. 💄 I. Looked. AMAZING! When he was finished he said to me, “Danielle, I never knew all that was under there.” HA!! Neither did I! Thank you, Derrick for your creativity, humility and your ability to make women feel their very best. You are a true artist and friend. I 💙 you much! 💋 #makeupartist #makeupartisttothestars #myfriend #vegaslife #vegaslocal

If the wedding is any indication, this is going to be a very different royal couple. The Duchess of Sussex brought a modern, diverse, African American experience to this amazing, traditional, historical moment. They shook things up and did it *their* way. I can’t wait to see the impact these two will have on the world around them. BTW, I don’t know who took this photo but it has become one my favorite pictures from the wedding. If you can locate the photographer (I’m assuming this was a drone flying overhead) let me know so I can credit them. UPDATE: @bbcnews credits @reuters on the photo. Excellent job, Reuters. #RoyalWedding #ilovelove #photooftheday

Soooooo I’m loving Vegas. My Life Coach, Unity family member and good GF, Cynthia Henderson invited me to the Lionel Richie show at @planethollywood Vegas.

Want to know how to burn a bunch of calories, get in 10K steps and never leave your complex? Try unpacking boxes for 13 hours. That’s what I did yesterday. Couple that with eight trips up and down 41 steps to the recycle bin and you can imagine how tired I am right now. Only about 25 boxes more to go. But not today! I’ve unpacked four boxes this afternoon and that’s it for today!!!

My cross county move has totally thrown off my body clock.

Sooooo @thedrybar on the @vegas Strip offers complimentary champagne with each blowout. They also offer a full-service cocktail bar.🍸 I am not mad. PLUS my blowout was beautiful. By comparison, the DC Drybar serves herbal tea ☕️. I think I’m going to like living in Vegas! 😉#lasvegas #myvegaslife

I am officially a Nevadian now. Took a moment between setting up the apartment and settling in @zazziecats to hit the @vegas Strip with my BFF. @kamikaziphotos was nice enough to help me fly the boys to Vegas (she had one Cat and had the other) AND drag suitcases, furniture and all manner of stuff up three flights of stairs to my new digs. She’s a true friend!! #bff #myfriendsrock #vegas #myvegaslife

Have you ever wondered what to do with your old buttons, photo IDs, backstage passes, name tags and credentials? Why not take them out of the box and put them on display? Thanks to @michaelahairston3232 for working through the night to get me my memorabilia in time for my move (he works best under a tight deadline). Here’s a look at what he was able do for me. Nice.

You know what’s not fun? Taking two cats to the Vet who hate car rides and hate the Vet’s office. Remind me why I rescued TWO animals?

You know who doesn’t care I have a million things to do today? @zazziecats that’s who. Copland is purring away. Meanwhile he has my left hand trapped. When I removed my hand he acted like I committed a crime against humanity.  #lifewithcats #cat #pets #catlady #catlover #catlife

‪Artist @djrarela took to Twitter to share black and white images — old and new — with quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. However, Daniel Rarela didn't pull quotes from King's Aug. 28, 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech. Instead, his images contain lines from King's "Letter from a Birmingham Jail." Written on April 16, 1963, MLK’s words still rings true today.

From today’s sermon: Write down there things to do that would constitute you living your best life. Begin to look at what it is that is keeping you from achieving, experiencing and being what you want. What needs to be revealed to you? What fears need to be addressed? Begin to address your fears. Be attentive because your fears may be disguising themselves as a defense mechanism. Examine how are you getting in your own way? If you are going to “reclaim your time,” reclaim your time to work on yourself. Use this new year to gain insights into what is stopping you from living your best life. If you are coming up with people, places or things you are on the wrong track because then you are giving away your power. What is stopping you within your own being? Can you stand in the light of your own being? Can you be with yourself and love yourself? Start there. Start loving yourself. #unitywdc #liveyourlife #liveyourbestlife #loveyourself

#2017bestnine features work travel to Algeria and Bermuda, vacation on Peter’s Island and Virgin Gorda with my BFF before the arrival of Hurricane Irma, a march on Capitol Hill, Diner en Blanc DC on Pennsylvania Ave, FINALLY seeing Hamilton on Broadway, teaching my HIIT fitness class, me watching myself on a video clip talk about my house in historic LeDroit Park at the National Building Museum and my very first HU Convocation (don’t judge me). It was a very good year filled with extreme highs and gut wrenching lows. BUT I am very glad to see 2017 exit. The highs were very high and the lows very low but lessons were learned and life marched on. #bye2017 #hello2018

As a producer, I use to book Roland Martin on American’s Black Forum. Then I had the opportunity to be a guest on his TV One “News One Now” show representing Black Women Bike DC. We talked about cycling and using biking for fitness. Martin’s show gave us a much needed voice in American news, health and politics. The TV One show is ending but I know it’s not the end of the road for Roland. He’ll be back on another platform. We’ll be waiting and watching.

Dear Winter Weight Gain, I see your moves. You always like to creep back in from my birthday in early November through the holidays. Wellllll, not this time. I see you creeping back on and I’m coming for you! I am back to running 🏃🏽‍♀️ and watching my diet. I worked too darn hard to knock off 20 pounds and I still have 10 more to go. So the 2.5 pound I gained was enough of a wakeup call. No mas. You are going DOWN!

DMV, the snow is starting to come down. Predictions are snow accumulations could be between 2 -4 inches.That means we could get a dusting or a foot because, Mother Nature... Before you get snowed in... come on out to City Fitness Gym and get an AM workout in me. You’ll burn calories and build strong 💪🏽 bones and muscles. That way you won’t feel guilty about all the egg not and snacks you are about to consume when you are bondage watchig TV while you watch the snow fall. Class starts at 10:30 AM. We are at the Cleveland Park Metro so no need to drive and get stuck in the snow. See you then! I’m saving a spot for you. P.S. If I can get to the gym after a big concert and five hours of sleep, you can get up and get moving also. If you can’t join me, be sure to get a workout in at your favorite gym or even at home. This is the only body you get. Treat it well. #fitlife #fitness #fitnessinstructor #DC #gymlife

The look on your face after you practiced for six months on your Christmas concert and it is now finally OVER! I look exhausted and I was! But all the hard work is done. I remembered all the lyrics and hit all the notes. I think 🤔 You have no idea how glad I am this concert is over. Our Annual Christmas Concert is a lot of fun but it is also a LOT of work. Whew! Talk about a labor of love! #wedidit #churchchoir #christmasconcert #dc #choirlife #gladitsover #icanbreathe

Another successful Unity Of Washington DC Annual Christmas Concert is in the bag. Thanks to my choir family and the amazing conductors, musicians, soloists, sound team and our extraordinary musical director for making last night a success. Special thanks to everyone who came out to the concert to spend the evening with us. Without you... an amazing audience to share our gifts with... all our hard work would be pointless. We appreciate your presence, energy and love. If you were in attendance I am sure you had cheerful and uplifting time. It is our sincere pleasure and honor to share our musical ministry with you all.

It was a great day shaping the minds of the next generation of creatives at the Prince George Country Community College Media Day. I had a class of 30 high school students who are preparing to head to college or enter the work force. One student already has a following of 95K on YouTube. 😮 We talked about ways to turn their passion for social into a lucrative career. I’m impressed by these young minds! The hashtags they came up with for today was #FutureCreators and #checkmyanalytics Soooooo... I’ll be keeping my eyes on these teens.

This little girl in the picture was so full of hope and joy. As I complete another circle around the sun I'm thinking of her. She's a woman now and although she's seen a lot of the world, she still dreams BIG and looks forward to an abundant future. I use my birthday as a time of celebration but also a time of reflection. So on my born day, I'd like to talk to this little girl... my younger self. Hey Danielle, you've got the gift of gab. It's going to get you in trouble in school but it will pay off later as you build a career in communications. You tend to love very deeply and that is cool...but guard your heart a little more closely...while never being afraid to share your talents, time or treasures. Let your cousin Jackie play with the dang Barbie dolls. She's going to bring that up for the next 40 years so just let her play with them! Your parents are not perfect but they are very special and they'll take very good care of you. Thank God for your Dad (his love will never waiver), and thank the Lord for your mom, sisters, friends and sheltered suburban upbringing. All of that love and care will shape you into a fearless, adventurous, ambitious, loving woman. Hold on to that. Be especially thankful for your friends and treasure them dearly. Many of your childhood friends will still be by your side into adulthood and your college friends will become your chosen family. Pat yourself on the back for your upcoming college choice. You don't know it yet, but attending Howard University will be one of the best decisions of your life. Finally, learn to forgive yourself. You won't always get it right but you will alway rise to the top. Shine on little, girl. This thing called life is going to be an AMAZING ride and we're going to ride it until the wheels fall off! Happy birthday to me! #happybirthday #happybirthdaytome #scorpioseason

It’s always a pleasure to present to an eager and enthusiastic group of @legacyintl Professional Fellows.

Walking through Georgetown I marveled at how beautiful the homes are. I’ve been to G-Town 10,000 times, but leisurely walking through the neighborhood gave me a new appreciation for the architecture of the homes. It also let me know that residences of Georgetown take Halloween VERY seriously.
