Wooden it be nice if all museums were free to visit like the Smithsonian American Art Museum? We’re quite in love with this particular piece. “Drift ” is a sculpture made of white oak and bamboo, by Matthias Pliessnig. He creates his pieces through a process called “steam-bending”, in which “strips of wood are first air-dried, then soaked in water for several hours before being placed in a steam box...saturated with water and heated, rendering the resin inside pliable and the wood extremely malleable....when the wood is removed it must be bent into position and clamped into place within thirty seconds, after which it will cool, regaining rigidity.” The result is this trippy creation.

Okay guys, I’m planning my next road trip. In a few weeks I’m gonna attempt to conquer Highway 1. So, what are some of the coolest, off-the-beaten path places I should hit up? I’ve got the basics (national parks, major touristy stuff) but I wanna know the can’t-miss, must-see places along the route. I got three weeks, a car, and tons of downloaded podcasts. So, where should I go?! Dive bars, the world’s largest bowling ball, rad hotels, weird roadside wonders? Lemme know! 🚗 🚗 🚗 #discover_earthpix #discovertheroad #instapic #instagood #instatravel #wanderlust #travelphoto #discover #discovertheworld #roadtrip #roadtrippers  #beautifulworld #amazingworld #amazingplanet #letsgosomewhere #exploremore #explore #packandgo #exploreeverywhere #travelstoke #alifealive #stayandwander #visualsforlife #keepexploring #ourplanetdaily #wondermore #liveauthentic

The drive to South Dakota's Black Hills can be long and somewhat monotonous. But, it doesn't have to be. When you're on I-94 hop off at Exit 72 and you'll find yourself on the Enchanted Highway, which is quite possibly the quirkiest 32 miles of road in America. This southwestern North Dakota stretch of two-lane road has been dubbed "The Enchanted Highway" because of the many whimsical and weird scrap metal sculptures that dot the landscape. Sculptor Cary Greff's creations are located just 40 miles east of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and they've helped drum up tourism for this part of North Dakota. 🚗 🚗 🚗 #discover_earthpix #discovertheroad #instapic #instagood #instatravel #wanderlust #travelphoto #discover #discovertheworld #roadtrip #roadtrippers  #beautifulworld #amazingworld #amazingplanet #letsgosomewhere #exploremore #explore #packandgo #exploreeverywhere #travelstoke #alifealive #stayandwander #visualsforlife #keepexploring #ourplanetdaily #wondermore #liveauthentic #northdakota #enchantedhighway

When you’re driving the Great Northern, across the Dakotas and Montana on your way to Washington, there’s a pretty amazing little town called Choteau, MT (between Yellowstone and Glacier National Park). This place is the definition of a hidden gem and you’d totally miss it if you stayed on the highway. It’s a sleepy little town along Routes 89 and 287, home to abandoned buildings that look like they’re straight outta “Deadwood”. It claims to be home to the world’s best prime rib, as most prime rib joints claim (get it on Thursday’s before they run out), and it’s run amok with weird dinosaurs. These dinos reminded me of the icons from church, no matter where you are they seem to be looking right at you. 🚗 🚗 🚗 🚗 #discover_earthpix #discovertheroad #instapic #instagood #instatravel #wanderlust #travelphoto #discover #discovertheworld #roadtrip #roadtrippers  #beautifulworld #amazingworld #amazingplanet #letsgosomewhere #exploremore #explore #packandgo #exploreeverywhere #travelstoke #alifealive #stayandwander #visualsforlife #keepexploring #ourplanetdaily #wondermore #liveauthentic

Rattlesnake Grade off WA-129. Connecting Enterprise, Oregon and Clarkston, Washington, this road is deemed one of the top 15 rides in America by the American Motorcycle Association. The 80-mile trip features an insanely rad backdrop of the Pacific Northwest at its finest. I’m talking vast canyons, snow-capped mountains, ancient forests, a ghost town, and lush river valley. There’s not a heck of a lot of traffic on this route, but be prepared for some killer switch backs.

Fancy a road trip down Memory Lane? Remember these bad boys? The pre-Roadtrippers, pre-Lonely Planet, pre-Travel Channel, OG adventure inspiration...the travel brochure.

So if you’re in Las Vegas and the crowded strip is starting to feel a little suffocating, hit the road and head east for one of the most beautiful drives in the world… Just roughly an hour east of Las Vegas sits the Valley of Fire State Park, Your trip starts on I-15 as the hustle and bustle of Vegas quickly turns to desolate Nevada desert. While I-15 isn’t particularly inspiring, a right-hand turn onto Valley of Fire Highway/Road quickly gives way to incredible beauty climaxing as you drive into the Valley of Fire State Park.

Proxy Falls is one absolutely unreal waterfall. It's seriously next-level. As one of the most photographed falls in the country it can get pretty busy during the spring, summer, and fall. This spring-fed waterfall has a wall of columnar basalt that's lined in moss...I'm not kidding when I say words really can't do this place justice. The water cascades down over 200 feet in what looks like a veil of water, hence the term Veil Falls. You can access the trails just off the McKenzie Pass Highway. When you reach the junction of Highways 126 and 242, follow signs towards 242 for a little over 6 miles, and you'll see signs for Proxy Falls Trailhead. Just follow the trail, which is conveniently a loop. A good tip is to follow the trail in the opposite direction it suggests, so basically in a clockwise fashion, so that you hit Upper Proxy Falls first, and then the Lower falls vantage point last. It's a less than a mile hike, and absolutely worth the detour! Awesome shot by @kyle.pnw

Happy Hot Spring Saturday! Our current obsession: Conundrum Hot Springs. But, tbh, the only conundrum I see is ever wanting to leave this killer view. Amirite? If you drive 1/2 mile west of Aspen down Highway 82 you’ll reach a roundabout where you’ll turn right onto Castle Creek Road. After a short five mile drive you’ll come to Conundrum Road. There’s a parking lot another 1 mile down, which is where the trail begins to take you 8.5 miles to Conundrum Hot Springs. Once you arrive at the hot springs prepare to be wowed by panoramic views of mountains and wildflowers. This hike also serves as the beginning for the much more challenging hikes to Crested Butte. The hiking trail takes you through woods and meadows and across three rivers on log bridges. Along the hike you’ll get amazing views of Cathedral Peak, Conundrum Peak, Castle Peak and Mt. Hayden. #Colorado #hiking #discovertheroad #roadtrip #roadtrippers #visitcolorado #hotspring #conundrumhotspring #crestedbutte #travel #travelphotography

In order to find some of the best-hidden secrets, you have to head off the highway and into the woods. Off OH-56 is Hocking Hills State Park, a patch of forest with loads of natural wonders: cliffs that contain caves; gorges with flowing waterfalls crossed by storybook-like footbridges; and all kinds of features carved by ancient and powerful glaciers. From Old Man's Cave and Cantwell Cliffs to Rock House and the Devil's Bathtub. For added beauty, approach the park along the Hocking Hills Scenic Byway, a twisting, winding road that will take you deep into the forest! #ohio #hockinghills #hockinghillsstatepark #travel #photography #naturephotography #waterfall #waterfalls #discovertheroad #roadtrippers #roadtrip

Fort Jefferson is one of the most iconic sights in Dry Tortugas National Park. The largest brick masonry structure in the Americas, the unfinished fortress is made up of more than 16 million bricks! It’s construction began all the way back in 1847, and even though the six-sided, four-tiered, 1,000-heavy-gun fort was never completed, it remained in active use from the Civil War until the 1930s.

The hotel that inspired Stephen King to pen the iconic horror novel “The Shining”, is The Stanley in Estes Park, CO, just outside Rocky Mountain National Park. He checked into the hotel in 1973 for a one-night stay with his wife, Tabitha. Fortuitously, they were the only guests at the hotel that night. They pretty much had the run of the place, but King wasn’t convinced they were actually alone. The room he stayed in was Room 217, which is, to this day, the hotel’s most-requested room. The Shining was inspired by these events and the overall experience of being secluded in the grand resort hotel alone. The Stanley appeared in the 1990s King-sanctioned made-for-TV series version, as he wasn’t a fan of Stanley Kubrick’s atmosphere-heavy, plot-light take on his material. Today you can watch both King’s and Kubrick’s versions on a nonstop loop on the hotel’s Channel 42.

New Mexico's White Sands National Monument rises up from Tularosa Basin and is seriously one unreal natural wonder. The sands are pure white and glisten in the sunlight, creating waves of dunes across 275 square miles of desert. The sand is made up of gypsum crystals, which you find in hot springs, but is a mineral rarely found in sand. Sand is usually composed of quartz. White Sands National Monument however, is the world's largest gypsum dunefield. Amazing shot by @everchanginghorizon

Sin City is known for being flashy, and its signage is no exception. But what happens to the totally rad signs from the Strip once they get worn down or outdated? They head to the Neon Boneyard. The Boneyard is run by the Neon Museum, which collects, preserves, studies and exhibits some of Vegas’s most iconic old signs from the 1930's to today. The entire museum encompasses 2 acres, and the Boneyard (which houses more than 150 gorgeous retro signs) is only a part of it. There’s also a gallery, with 60 more kitschy vintage neon signs, like ones from Palms Casino Resort, New-New York, Lady Luck, O’Shea’s and tons more. You can get an up-close the Boneyard as part of an hour-long tour (hint: go in the evening or at night to see the signs in all their blazing neon glory), or book it for a photo shoot (wedding pictures after you elope in Vegas, maybe?) And as if it couldn’t get any cooler, the Neon Museum’s Visitor’s Center is located in the distinctive lobby of the La Concha Motel-- it’s an excellent example of mid-century space age-inspired architecture and complements the old-school signage perfectly.

It started with a dream. A vision for a place where artists could come together and create fantastical works of art. That dream became a reality for Reno-based artist, Chad Sorg, who wanted to create a "car forest" at the End of the World. The International Car Forest of the Last Church is the manifestation of that dream. It's a hallowed earthen automobile graveyard, with over 40 graffittied cars, trucks and buses. The installation was the brainchild of collaborators, Sorg and Michael "Mark" Rippie. Rippie owns the 80 acres of land that the art installation was built on, and began the art project back in 2002, with the dream of owning the Guinness Book of World Records title for "most cars planted vertically in the ground." As one does... Awesome photos by @ride_onthewildside

The most famous trail at Sand Flats is Hell's Revenge, which as the name suggests, is extremely challenging. Rated a 6/10 on the difficulty scale by the Red Rock 4-Wheelers, this trail is not for the faint of heart. Hell's Revenge runs 6.5 miles in length and is marked by yellow flame symbols painted on the rocks. It's considered a world-class off-road route for a reason, though... be on the lookout for obstacles with names like "The Black Hole", "The Elevator", and "The Hot Tubs". Hell's Revenge also happens to cross over Slick Rock Trail, which any mountain biker should definitely check out. Awesome shot by @pandoraspilot

On the corner of Walden Drive and Carmelita Avenue in Beverly Hills, California, lies a very odd little home. The neighborhood itself is pretty upscale, yet smack dab in the middle is a house that many refer to as the “Witch’s House.” Designed by Harry Oliver, a Hollywood art director, who helped create sets, and oversaw the creative design of over 30 films, from 1919 til 1938. The house is considered a “storybook house,” named so for its impeccable focus on whimsical fairytale elements that you’d expect to find in magical forests, where witches use cauldrons for potions, and fairies and elves frolick atop red and white mushrooms…or something like that. The house is known as the “Witch’s House,” because of its intentionally-dilapitated architecture. Over the years it’s since become a very popular landmark for area tours.

Rising up from the flat, dusty desert, it’s hard to miss the imposing and mysterious Shiprock. At over 7,000 feet above sea level, this bizarre rock formation is actually the remains of a 27-million-year-old volcano. The rock was sacred to the Navajo people, who called it the “Tsé Bitʼaʼí“, or “the rock with wings”. According to legend, it’s all that remains of the giant bird that carried the Navajo from the north to New Mexico.

Dale Chihuly is one of the most famous glass artists ever, and the Tacoma native drew from his childhood in the Pacific Northwest for a lot of inspiration. It's fitting the Chihuly Garden and Glass is in Seattle, and it's one of the most incredible experiences in the city. The glasshouse, which houses many of his works, is inspired by his love for greenhouses and conservatories, and eight galleries (complete with drawing walls, which display light paintings made by the glass sculptures) offer some views of the breathtaking glasswork. The garden surrounds the glasshouse, and features glass pieces like Reeds on Logs, the Crystal and Icicle Towers and four massive sculptures in the corners to anchor it all... and, of course, there are scores of vines, flowers, trees, and shrubs tying it all together. Fantastic photos by @chihulygg

What makes Zzyzx, California such a weird and wonderful place (other than the name)? Well, for one it was founded by a crackpot preacher who stuck his middle finger up at the government when he named the town with the last letters of the alphabet. So, who the heck came up with that crazy name and why?! Well, it’s a tale as old as time...starring a fake doctor, some snake oil, carrot juice, and laxatives. Read about it in the link in our bio!

Three islands, one park....Welcome to the Islands of the Sacred Earth! The National Park of American Samoa is chillin' on three volcanic and mountainous islands and is the true definition of off-the-beaten path. You'll find it in the Southwest Pacific Ocean, halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand. It's clothed in tropical rainforest and ringed with rugged cliffs, glistening beaches, and coral reefs! You won't find many tourists, but you'll definitely meet the Samoan folks out there... and they're pretty much the nicest people ever (and super helpful!) It's a unique place unlike other national parks you'll visit... and it's one you have to see to understand!

Eureka Dunes is home to the singing sand! If you're heading to Death Valley National Park, you gotta stop by the sand dunes... The tallest sand dunes in California, might I add! They look like something straight outta the movies. They're pretty difficult to climb, so it's not for the faint of heart. If you got the willpower, it's totally worth it. Not only are they completely majestic, they also produce one of the strangest phenomena in the desert: singing sand! When the sand is completely dry, you may just be able to hear sounds similar to a pipe organ.  @mrhollender . . . . . . #discovertheroad #amazingworld #exploretheworld #travel #trip #wanderlust #travelgram #instatravel #traveling #roadtrips #travelphotography #beautifuldestinations #neverstopexploring #igtravel #instatraveling #exploremore #bucketlist #travelpics #globetrotter #visit #worldplaces #explore #adventure #photography #nationalparkweek #eurekadunes

One of the only places in the world that has all four kinds of volcanoes...Lassen Volcanic National Park packs a lotta heat! Things you can expect here: killer stargazing, clean air, steamy geothermal features, chilly temps but BOILING mud! It's a strange combination, we know. Pro tip: bring layers and some sturdy footwear.  The greater Lassen area has been volcanically active for about 3 million years and while it sleeps now, that won't always be the case. Although no one can say when it'll happen, there's evidence that it'll eventually erupt. Here's to hoping it's not anytime soon!

Top reason we love Capitol Reef National Park: You can pick your own fruit off the orchards you find here (side note: the orchards were planted by the pioneers that originally settled here! Pretty cool, huh?) There's almost 3,000 fruit-bearing trees including cherries, apricots, peaches, pears, and apples. Another reason we love the place is because it's off-the-beaten path in Utah and it doesn't get overly-crowded. There's super cool rock formations, petroglyphs, and plenty of opportunities for some killer photos.

It's about 70 miles west of Key West, Florida and it's only accessible by boat or seaplane...Sometimes, ya gotta work for what you want! This 100-square mile park is mostly open water (picturesque blue water, in case you were wondering). You'll also find seven small islands, coral reefs, and lots of marine life here! Once you find your way to Dry Tortugas, you can swim the day away, snorkel with the fishies, and even dive down to explore shipwrecks! It’s seriously an unforgettable adventure you should experience at least once in your life.

In the midst of the dry and arid Bryce Canyon National Park, there's a bunch of massively tall, lush, green, sweet-smelling Bryce Canyon pines... We're talkin' vanilla and butterscotch smelling. And for that reason alone, we're in love with the place! These 'Ponderosa Pines' grow along mesas, inside canyons, and are often seen peeking out of cliffs.. and they're pretty accessible to get to. If the Ponderosa Pines aren't your thing (P.S., we're judging), there's many more aboreal wonders to be found. And if that's still not what you're looking for, you can go hiking, horseback riding, biking, or take an ATV tour. You'll never be bored at Bryce Canyon National Park, that's for sure!

Towering at an impressive 14,000 feet above sea level, Mount Rainier is the mac daddy of glacial-peaked mountains. What’s even more amazing than what’s on top of the mountain is what’s underneath it…an active volcano! Surrounded by subalpine meadows full of wildflowers, this icy volcano is home to ancient forests, and six rivers that flow from her peaks. So, I guess what we’re saying is…what are you waiting for? The mountain is calling!

This insanely weird geothermal wonder is Fly Geyser and I'm willing to bet you've never seen anything quite like it. It was actually created by accident and minerals have been building up around it for about 50 years. The result? A colorful fountain that's still growing to this day. If you want to study this oddity for yourself, head to Gerlach, Nevada... oh, and feel free to send us any pictures you might snap.

If you’re looking at this photo wondering: Wait! Is that a freaking floating tent?! You’d be correct! It’s the brainchild of Ohio-based fishing gear company SmithFly. The Shoal Tent is an inflatable tent meant to be set up on the water. It combines the relaxing feeling of gently rippling water with a supremely cozy tent for a perfect night’s sleep in the Great Outdoors. This is NOT an ad, we just think it’s super cool. And we would NOT be opposed to taking one out for a spin! Hint hint, wink wink, nudge nudge... #smithfly #camping #campinglife #campinggear #tent #tentlife

There's over 130 random massive metal sculptures in Anza-Borrego State Park and they kind of just pop up along the road as you're driving. Besides this sea dragon (the biggest one!), you'll find horses, turtles, dinosaurs, and a lot more random creatures. Galleta Meadows is an absolute must-stop in the Cali' desert!

Let's all just take a moment to pay respect to Ra Paulette, the artist that LITERALLY carved these otherworldly sandstone caves all by himself (also a moment of silence for how bad his hands had to hurt after). He's carved about a dozen of these things in the desert of New Mexico and if that wasn't enough.. NONE of the designs are the same. Who is this guy and what species is he?!

Slide Rock State Park is home to a natural water slide that flows into a large pool where you can swim the day away.

This isn't your typical church, that's for sure! If you're thinking to yourself, "this place looks familiar", that's because it's been in a lotta TV shows and movies. It's a pretty popular place for weddings and funerals. Why, you ask? Cause the view is fricken' killer. It's surrounded by tall trees and lush gardens (you'll feel like you're in your own little world there). Wayfarer's Chapel is also known as "The Glass Church", which doesn't really need much explaining. I'm pretty sure I'd go to church every day if this were the view!

You're looking at the product of severe heartbreak! Coral Castle was built by a man named Edward Leedskalnin. Legend says that he had his heart broken by his fiancee, just one day before they were to get married. And shortly after, he contracted tuberculosis. Plot twist: he was miraculously healed (he claims it was from the healing power of magnets). After he was healed, he spent the next 30 years building Coral Castle..all by himself. If you're wondering how he moved all those heavy stones, SAME. But he did, and now you can reap the benefits and visit this man-made Coral Castle (filled with mystery and wonder), just outside Miami, FL.

It's honestly one of the most peaceful places on earth, and if you don't think so...we can't be friends. There's so many activities you can participate in here like canoeing, hiking, fishing... and if you wanna get real crazy, helicopter rides (talk about a life goal!)

Hidden gem alert! Bottle Tree Ranch is totally random and we freakin' love it. You'll find over 200 'trees' covered in colorful glass bottles here (right off Route 66 in Cali). Why? A local artist named Elmer Long and his father collected all of these bottles over the years and decided to do something with them. Talk about a bonding moment!

Antelope Canyon sure is a beaut, and if you're headed to Arizona, this has gotta go on your must-see list. It's actually the most visited and photographed slot canyon in the Southwest, and I mean it's pretty obvious why. Before you visit, you'll need to plan ahead and inquire about permits, but it really is one of those places you need to see before you die.

Potentially one of the best overlooks ever?? We think so. Mayer State Park is home to the mesmerizing Rowena Crest! We didn't know that just a picture of a horseshoe curved street could make us want to hop in the car and go, but it does. And can you blame us? You can probably guess, but this is one of the most photographed roads in Oregon, for really really good reason!

Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. You'll find this beauty in Abu Dhabi and if you're planning a visit, which you definitely should, be sure to respect the culture and wear clothes that completely cover you up. They also have extra clothes for visitors to borrow. We think the best way to see the mosque is on their free tour, but if you'd prefer to walk around aimlessly, that's cool too.

Jurassic Park is (sadly) fictional... but the Cabazon Dinosaurs are pretty much the next best thing! Their names are Ms. Dinny and Mr. Rex, and they call the California desert home. Back in the day, Dinny the Apatosaurus had a gift shop in her stomach, and Rex used to have a slide going down his tail. Today, they're just kitschy photo ops off the highway outside Palm Springs. And if they look familiar, that's probably because they made a cameo in Pee-wee's Big Adventure!

Anyone else tempted to go to Thailand just to see this temple up close & personal?! We're considering hopping on a plane right now. If you're a fan of history and exploring rad buildings, Ayutthaya may be the perfect fit because it's filled with just that! Who wants to take bets on how long it can stay that white??

If I woke up to a giraffe peering through my window, I could die happy! Can you think of a better alarm in the morning?! Giraffe Manor is a one-of-a-kind hotel where you can live alongside giraffes during your stay. Eating breakfast? They'll be there. Hanging out on the patio? They'll be there, too! Taking a walk around the manor? Yep! If you find yourself planning a trip to Kenya, make SURE this is on the list!

Who knew that rocks could be so pretty?! Seven Magic Mountains.. you make our heart skip a beat. Where can you find this roadside wonder? Head 15 minutes out of Las Vegas (you need a break from gambling and drinking anyways) and into the desert. You better hurry, though, cause they're only stickin' around till the end of 2018. There's a chance they'll get approved to stay around longer, but that's not a chance you should take. We'll see ya at the neon rocks!

Book-lovers ASSEMBLE! This library hotel is the greatest invention since sliced bread. And if you love reading, then you're gonna love Gladstone's Library. It was originally created as a place where scholars could stay while studying and it's now open for reservations.

Channel Islands National Park in Southern California is the place you daydream about when you're at work. And we aren't judging, we're California dreamin' about it, too!  If you're trying to make that dream a reality, you'll have to hop on a boat or small plane, since those are the only ways you can get there. And if you are, in fact, chartering a plane out... can we maybe, possibly tag along?

This reminds me of some weird planet you’d maybe see on Star Trek or something… It’s actually a part of Canyonlands National Park that’s called “the Needles”. Why is it called “the Needles” you ask? Well, I’ll tell ya! You see those massive red and white pillars everywhere? (If you don't, we suggest glasses) Well, yeah. Those are the Needles, and a long, long time ago, the whole area used to be a dune field. Talk about a transformation!

Location, location, location! The White Mesa Arch may not be the biggest natural arch, but boy oh boy does it have good real estate! When you visit, you'll probably have to fight off some photographers to get a good viewing spot. Just don't let it get too physical because on the other side, there's a very large drop that would be no bueno to go near. Pro tip: the best time to go is at sunrise because it glows like whoa! After sunset looks pretty rad too.

I'm pretty sure I'd sell my car just to stay in one of these cabins for a few nights. The red cabins you see, AKA Rorbuer cabins, used to be places for traveling fishermen to stay while fishing on Lofoten Islands. And now they're places you can rent if you're the type who enjoys unbeatable views just by looking out your cabin window. In all seriousness... Leknes, Norway may have just gone to the top of our list of places we HAVE to visit.

Lombard Street is hands-down one of our favorite streets here at Roadtrippers. I'm talking eight super sharp curves, on top of a wicked steep hill. So if you're prone to anxiety, just prepare yourself for some light heart palpitations the first time you drive down it. Known as “the crookedest street in the world”, Lombard Street's not only famous for its hairpin-turns, but it's also home to some of San Francisco’s most expensive real estate.

The chances that 'The Wave' was once the background on your computer are very, very high. This amazing sandstone rock formation is located in Arizona and is a very challenging hike that is NOT for the faint of heart. It's in such high demand that it requires a permit to visit, and only 20 people are allowed a day! It may be a process to get the permit, but man oh man would it be worth it!

Whoa...have you ever seen a glowing orange waterfall? Well, it's actually a pretty rare phenomenon, but it happens once a year at Horsetail Falls in Yosemite National Park. This "firefall" happens only when conditions are right and typically occurs in February. It's not something that happens often so if you're in the area around the right time, definitely check it out (& consider yourself lucky!)

The Neuschwanstein Castle was originally built with intentions to be a place the late King Ludwig II could withdraw from public life. However, King Ludwig passed away before the castle was complete and his original intentions of making the castle a private place were ruined. Just a short 7 weeks after his passing, the castle opened to the public and quickly became one of the most popular tourist attractions in Germany, drawing in 1.4 million people a year!

You're looking at the highest mountain in Japan! Mount Fuji is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption way, way back in 1707. More than 200,000 people climb to the summit every year (most hikers start at night in order to make it to the top by sunrise!) You've most likely seen this mountain in art pieces and photographs because its been inspiring artists for centuries! If you're in the area and up for the challenge, Mount Fuji is likely worth your time.. if you're into hiking that is.

Lofoten consists of a row of mountainous islands reaching out from the mainland to the Norwegian Sea. Located in the middle of an ocean, the climate here is rough and typically experiences strong winds, high waves, and dense fog. There's loads of fishing, hiking, climbing, cycling, and occasional skiing (although you'll probably only find enough snow in February - March).

Oneonta Gorge is one of those hidden treasures that you just have to see to believe! Tucked away within the beautiful Columbia River Gorge, this creek may be one of America's most beautiful hikes. If you plan on hiking the Oneonta Gorge, be prepared to get wet!! There are four major waterfalls along the gorge and at times, the stream itself is the actual trail you'll be walking! If you'd prefer not to get wet, there's also trails, observation decks, and bridges on dry land, but let's be real.. If you're going to check out this amazing place, you gotta go all out!

Riding a gondola in Venice, Italy is one of the best ways to experience the totally unique city and its maze of canals. The gondola is a flat-bottomed rowing boat that is handmade in the city and can feature many different types of wood, from oak and elm to cherry, walnut, and mahogany. A centuries-old tradition, the first recorded use of the gondola dates all the way back to the 11th century. When you take a ride, a gondolier will row you through the canals so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy.

Talk about the experience of a lifetime! These hot air balloons over Rose Valley are one of the best ways to enjoy the scenery. Rose Valley is located in the Cappadocia region of Turkey and is known for its unique rock formations and cave dwellings. When you take a hot air balloon over the valley, expect to learn a lot about its fascinating history and enjoy unbelievable views. Sometimes you'll get so close to a rock formation you can almost reach out and touch it!

Zion National Park is the best of everything. You've got the mountains, you've got canyons, you've got brightly-colored Navajo sandstone next to greenery along the Virgin River... what else do you need? Whether you're climbing to the tippy top of Angels Landing along a precarious-looking ridge, hiking between the thousand-foot walls of The Narrows, or rappelling into and wading through the epic subterranean-feeling tunnels of The Subway, every square inch of this park is worth exploring. - Great shot by @thesamosalife . . . . . . #discovertheroad #amazingworld #exploretheworld #travel #trip #wanderlust #travelgram #instatravel #traveling #roadtrips #travelphotography #beautifuldestinations #neverstopexploring #igtravel #instatraveling #exploremore #bucketlist #travelpics #globetrotter #visit #worldplaces #explore #adventure #photography #zionnationalpark #nationalparkgoals

Inside this huge sandstone rock is a surprise... a unique 5,000 square foot house! The 14-room home was built by the Christensens in the 1950s and comes complete with a 65-foot chimney and a carved out bathtub. Hole N" the Rock is now a quirky roadside attraction and is a must-visit on your way to or from Moab, Utah along Highway 191. You can take a short tour of the property and pick up some kitschy souvenirs. Oh, and make sure to look up when you arrive... or you might miss that rad Jeep up top!

Wait, what’s an atlatl rock? It's an ancient spear-launcher engineered out of boulders or rocks. These were used by Native Americans in the Southwest centuries ago.

It's nestled in a forest just minutes away from a ski resort and some of the best hiking spots in the Central Cascades. But if you're not up for adventure, that's cool, too.

Delicate Arch is a 60-foot tall freestanding arch, found in Utah's Arches National Park. This geological feature is one of the most famous in the state and draws visitors from all over the world. Before it was officially named Delicate Arch, it had a few different names including... "Cowboy's Chaps" and "Old Maid's Bloomers". It earned the name "Delicate" in 1934 for being the "most delicately chiseled arch in the entire area." You'll have to hike to get up close to it, but it's a must-visit destination when you're in the area.

This is the second largest state park in the US, and we think it's kind of gorgeous... but we think that about pretty much every park! Immerse yourself in nature at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park on the eastern end of San Diego County in California. Here, you'll find 600,000 acres of jagged peaks, mystical desert, and pure, wide-open wilderness. The park has a few hundred miles of dirt roads and lots of hiking trails for exploring, and plenty of camping spots for those looking to camp out under the stars.

Oh, hey there Abraham Lincoln! His bust is just one of 43 giant presidential heads eerily abandoned on a farm in the small town of Croaker, Virginia. They each weigh up to a hefty 22,000 lbs, and were saved by Howard Hankins from the nearby Presidents Park when it shut down in 2010. They've been crumbling away waiting for a new home ever since. You'll have to get permission to visit, since they're on private property... but let's hope they find a new home soon!

Holy hot springs, Batman! The pools of Las Grutas de Tolantongo look like the perfect place to take a rejuvenating dip. Located about 3-4 hours northwest of Mexico City,  it is a hot spring haven that includes several hidden hot spring grottos, natural and manmade geothermal pools and a unique hot spring river, all within a stunning and secluded canyon. This is definitely one for the bucket list!

For the more adventurous... adventurers out there, this is the vertigo-inducing view of Iceberg Lake and Iceberg Peak from the top of the dizzying 1,372-meter-tall Mount Wilbur in Montana. The catch?

A church hanging from a cliff? Why not! This is the stunningly beautiful 16th century Sanctuary of Madonna della Corona. It might not *technically* be hanging, but it looks that way because it's built on top a small cliffside surface of the Baldo Rocks in Verona, Italy. It was an ideal place for hermit monks during the medieval ages. Today, it's accessible by either a 1,500-step climb from the village of Bentino or a short paved path from the village of Spiazzi above.

Ever wondered where the longest wooden stairway in the world is located? You'll find it in Florli, a small town in Norway that has no roads, but does happen to have a very long and steep stairway with 4,444 steps (that's roughly roughly 270 floors high). At the top? Some pretty breathtaking views of the Lyserfjord.

Who’s up for a little ice canyoneering? Maligne Canyon within the Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada looks epically beautiful in the winter. The river inside the canyon freezes solid, making it possible to explore the various nooks and crannies... by walking on ice! No guard rails, no fences... just you, your gear, the ice and the natural beauty of the canyon. Winter tours are available but you can explore the canyon DIY-style, too.

Whoa... is this on Earth? It sure is! This is the amazing Timanfaya National Park, where over a hundred volcanoes can be found within a small area of roughly 20 square miles in size.

These unusual donut-shaped buildings are called “tulou” or “earthen buildings” and they are traditional dwellings unique to the Hakka people of China's Fujian province. Built between the 12th and the 20th century, the walls are made out of soil, bamboo and stones mixed together and piled up as high as 5 stories! Today, there are about 46 sites throughout the area that are considered as UNESCO World Heritage sites.

Whoa! Although this looks like a floating house in the middle of nowhere, it’s actually a lighthouse that was built in 1875 and is still in active use today. The building itself sits on top of a rock just 200 meters from the coast and about 2 miles from downtown Oslo in Norway. The Dyna Lighthouse has also been functioning as a seasonal event space since 1992. Cool, huh?

Wow! Often described as one of the most beautiful highways in the world, the 16-mile H-3 highway, also known as John A Burns Freeway, snakes through some of the most stunning landscapes on Oahu. It connects Pearl Harbor to another Marine Base on Mokapu Peninsula in Hawaii. It was opened in 1997, 30 years after it was conceptualized, to the tune of $80 million per mile, which makes it the most expensive interstate highway ever built to date! Impressive!

Set above the treetop canopy with a panoramic view of the Mayan jungle and the Carribean coast, it's the latest addition to the beautiful Kin Toh Restaurant.

These are the ruins of Fort Jefferson, an unfinished fortress about 70 miles away from civilization on top of a beautiful island called the Garden Key within Dry Tortugas National Park in lower Florida Keys. Built in 1847 using over 16 million bricks, it’s so massive that it's considered to be the largest brick structure in the US today! The easiest way to get there is via a daily ferry from Key West, and the best part? You can even pitch a tent, snorkel, or go for a swim!

We all know by now that Iceland is a cool place to visit, with all its remote barren beauty and otherworldly landscapes, but did you know that it also has its own version of Stonehenge?! These 72 large rocks set on top of a hill at its northernmost village of Raufarhofn is called the “Arctic Hedge.” It was started in 1996, and is the Arctic’s modern version of Stonehenge, acting as a pagan monument and huge sun dial.

Wind down and relax your body at the wickedly cool cascading hot spring waterfalls and thermal pools of Cascate de Mulino. Here around 800 liters of sulfurous hot spring water gushes out per second, and it's been known to have therapeutic effects since Roman times.

What we love about Ruby Valley Hot Springs in Nevada, is that it's rarely crowded and it's pretty primitive. And the view of the surrounding mountain ranges is to die for. The catch? You need an offroad vehicle to reach these hot springs, as it’s a good hour away via unpaved roads from the nearest town of Elko.

Built sometime in the 13th century, these are the remains of over 5,800 human bones, artfully and neatly arranged inside a pit called the Eggenburg Charnel in the small town of Eggenburg, Austria.

If you know us, you probably know we have a thing for a sexy road. And this is one of the coolest we’ve seen yet. A double twisty road with a couple of overpasses to boot! Now where is this you ask? It's located around the onsen resort town of Hakone in Japan, not too far from Tokyo, and a great place to visit for a perfect view of Mt. Fuji!

Whoa... This town is literally living under a rock! Here you can explore gorgeous cliffside houses and dwellings, all built under rock overhangs in the old town of Setenil De La Bodegas in Cadiz Spain. The street in the photo is Calle Cuevas de la Sombra. But, seriously, the entire area, including the road, is under a gigantic rock! So cool.

Enjoy a bath in the middle of nowhere in this rad copper bath tub, at the swanky and modern Hotel Aire de Bardenas in Tudela, Spain.  Here everything is simple yet elegant, if a bit unusual...in a good way. In addition to great architecture, they also have a year round outdoor pool and bubble rooms.

Meet the “Ghost Rider”... and no it's not Nicolas Cage! It’s one of the many weirdly-cool life-size sculptures you’ll find at the 7.8 acre Goldwell Open Air Museum in the Mojave Desert! What started as a sculpture park created by a group of Belgian artists near the historic ghost town of Rhyolite Nevada in 1984 was turned into a museum after the death of prominent artist and leader Albert Szukalski in 2000. One can also find a ghostly version of the “Last Supper” or a lady version of Icarus called “Icara” on display. And the best part? It’s free to visit!

This zigzag path leads to an ancient church, built on top of an old temple. The Church of Panagia on the remote island of Folegandros in Greece, not too far from Santorini, is the centerpiece of the island. From its hilltop location above the main town of Hora, it has a fantastic vantage point to enjoy the island's beauty, including a picture perfect sunset.

Whoa... This is the entrance to an amazing world of books. Aside from its wall-to-wall display of all kinds of books, maps, magazines etc., the Liberia Acqua Alta (or “Book Store of High Water”), located in the often flooded Venice, Italy uses buckets, bathtubs and even a full-size gondola to stuff its overflowing collection of books, and protect them when the water comes rushing in. Their fire exit even opens directly into a canal.

Only visible when the water level is low, this is the old Petrolandia Church in Sao Francisco, Brazil. It’s the only remaining evidence of what used to be the location of the town of Petrolandia, before the area was flooded and the town’s residents relocated in 1979, as a result of the construction of the Luiz Gonzaga dam and one of the largest hydroelectric power plant in Brazil down steam.

Originally built in the 16th century, meet the “Crooked House of Windsor” (and it's actually located very close to Windsor Castle). The building got its name from its obviously unusual shape caused by the use of unseasoned oak wood during reconstruction. And what’s even more interesting is that it used to have a tunnel that connected directly to the castle’s kitchen, where they delivered food when it was a still butcher shop. Just Brilliant!

The 19th century city of Tombstone in Cochise County, Arizona got its name from its founder, and valuable ore prospector Ed Schieffelin, who named the place in reference to his friends who kept telling him that the only stone he’ll find in his quest for fortune is his own tombstone. It now provides one of the best historical experiences of the old west, and and you can even experience live reenactments of the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

Welcome to the “Just Room Enough” island, located in the Thousand Islands chain in New York. Apparently it’s the smallest among the almost 2,000 islands in the area, and barely qualifies as an island itself with just a couple of trees, a tiny house and some beach chairs. This is a private island like most of the rest but one can book a boat tour and enjoy the sights from the water.

This is the “Dean’s Blue Hole”, the second deepest salt water blue hole in the world. It’s about 200 meters deep and can be found in Long Island, Bahamas. Now, if you're wondering what's a Blue Hole, it’s basically an underwater sinkhole with a characteristically deep blue color due to its depth. Other notable salt water blue holes are Dragon Hole in South China Sea (the deepest) and the Great Blue Hole in Belize. Let’s go for a dive!

Now that's a view! The Cueva Ventana or “cave window” in Arecibo, Puerto Rico is a large cave that looks like a window, on a limestone cliff overlooking the beautiful Rio Grande de Arecibo Valley below. It's been used as a shooting location for a couple of films and TV series and even though it's on private property, anyone is welcome to visit it too for a small entry fee.

It’s big, it’s weird… and it's awesome! The Spiral Jetty is an art installation by Richard Smithson made out of rocks, mud and salt crystals. It’s about 460 meters long and was constructed in the 1970s, half submerged on one end of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah. It became more visible starting about a decade ago due to continuous drought and the receding water of the lake…but one should still check the water level and weather before going!

Test your nerves at the “Stairway to Nothingness”. Here you get the chance to step onto a glass platform and experience a vertigo-inducing 400 meters above the Dachstein Glacier, at the Dachstein Glacier World in Schladming, Austria. On the way, take a gondola lift and cross a suspension bridge to reach the platform then continue further to the Sky Walk and explore the Ice Palace. Truly an experience that’s above the clouds!

Travel back in time when you visit one of the oldest “Pueblos” in America. With amazing stone-carved, natural recess caves and cliff dwellings dating back almost a thousand years ago. Take a glimpse at the ancient way of life in the Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico. To reach the caves, follow an easy 1.2 mile trail through the Frijoles Canyon and climb 140-feet up through a number of stone stairs and four wooden ladders. Oh and of course with over 30,000 acres, there's tons more to explore within the national monument!

This is the twisty and steep road to Garajau beach, on the island of Madeira in Portugal! This used to be the only way to the beach (which is popular for diving and its nice calming waters), until the cable car was inaugurated in 2007. Now, you can enjoy a walk or drive down to the beach, and then take the cable car for a relaxing climb up after a long day.

Wow!! It might be an end of an era... but definitely a great new beginning for these wooden escalators in Sydney! For 80 years, these rare wooden escalators served as gateways to one of the busiest subway stations in Australia... and after being retired earlier this year, they were recently brought back to life by artist Chris Fox as an impressive and super cool sculpture called “Interloop” and hangs proudly on the ceiling of Wynyard Station’s York Street entrance.

All aboard.... With over 25 well-preserved operational vintage passenger steam locomotives, the Harz Narrow Guage Railway in central Germany, which has been operating for over a hundred years, has the largest fleet in the world. It covers 3 lines, about 85 miles of tracks and 40 train stations. It runs all year round with a regular daily schedule over some of the most picturesque and well-preserved towns in Germany… and it’s particularly beautiful during winter in Brocken, the highest mountain in the region.

Whoa....this is one of the ice caves you’ll see when you visit the Big Four Ice Caves Trail in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington. These caves begin to form during the summer months when warm winds push up against the permanent ice field of the Big Four Mountain. They're accessible up until the winter season starts.

These cool, and sorta weird looking, head-like sculptures made from twigs and sticks, are the new residents of Orenco Wood Nature Park in Hillsboro Oregon. The amazing artwork called "Head over Heels" was created by famous artist Patrick Dougherty together with local volunteers and was built without using a single nail.

Whoa. This is the "Pyramid of the Magician" in the ancient Mayan city of Uxmal, in the very beautiful Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A UNESCO Heritage site, Uxmal was the biggest Mayan city, home to over 25,000 Mayans during its peak between 600-1,000AD... and this pyramid was and is still is the tallest and most recognizable structure in the city.

The Hamilton Pool Preserve, near Dripping Springs, TX used to be an underground river, but after the dome collapsed due to erosion, it revealed a massive natural pool underneath. Swimming is allowed most times but can get very crowded during summer months so make sure to check out their website before you go. A short drive from Austin, and a relatively short hike is all you need to reach this stunningly beautiful natural wonder.

If you end up somewhere in one of the most remote places on earth, Patagonia… you may stumble upon these majestic sharp mountain peaks. Rising  over 2,500 meters above sea level these are the Torres del Paine. You can find them within the national park of the same name, in southern Chile’s side of Patagonia.

Would you believe this is in the middle of the desert? Yup! This building is only one of the attractions you'll see when you visit the amazing Miracle Garden in Dubai, which is right smack in the Middle East. At over 780,000 square feet and about a 100 million planted flowers, it's considered to be the world's largest natural flower garden....and it's usually open between October and April each year when the climate is a li'l bit cooler.

Fancy an icebath... at 3AM? Well, head over to Iceland and enjoy a dip in the icy cold water underneath the midnight sun. And if you visit during the summer months, you can enjoy up to 24 hours of daylight exploring the country, which also happens to have one of the coolest scenic highways called Route 1! The downside? You'll probably be hard pressed to find time to sleep.

Experience the old charm of the legendary Route 66, when you visit the town of Seligman in Arizona! Here you can explore some of the original shops still open and going strong, such as The Copper Cart, and the famous Snowcap Drive-In, among others. Oh and of course a visit there wouldn't be complete without a stop at the "Return to the 50s" shop (pictured) for some memorabilias and souvenirs.

Is this a hole to the center of the earth? Not really but it's deep enough it might as well be... This cringe-worthy hole is Jacobs Well, on the floor of Cypress Creek in Wimberley, Texas. It's about 3.7 meters wide and over 37 meters deep with a rather mysterious appearance, making it a very popular spot for divers and locals alike specially during the summer months.

Flamingos, white sand beach, and perfect weather… Where is this paradise?! Well, it's the aptly-named Flamingo Beach, on Renaissance Island in Aruba. It’s a 40-acre privately owned tropical island that’s part of the Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino…which means unless you’re a guest, you likely need to pay at least $100 for a day pass to get to the island and interact with these amazing birds.

Here’s something a bit unusual… this is one of four Elk Antler Arches guarding the Town Square in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The first one was originally built in 1953 by the local Rotary club and proved to be very popular with tourists, so they decided to build 3 more between 1966 and 1969, one in each corner of the Town Square. The arches weights roughly 10,000-12,000 pounds each, and were replaced with new sets of antlers in the last decade.

Aptly named "Mistrider", it's comprised of 4 parallel lines and runs for over 2,000 feet across the famous landmark. A totally new away to experience such an iconic natural wonder!

Want to kiss a whale? Yes kiss! Well, you might just get lucky if you head to San Ignacio Lagoon in Mulege, in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Here massive gray whales, as big as a bus and weighing up to 40 tons with gigantic blow holes, have a long history of interacting with people. They even teach their calfs to do the same.

This is the Tempietto Valadier, an impressive almost 200-year old temple built by Pope Leone XII. It was built just a few meters from the 10th century Sanctuary of Santa Maria infra Saxa chapel, inside the Frasassi Caves of Genga in Ancona, Marche Italy. The catch? It's a 700-meter steep hike up to reach the cave... but if you can handle the cardio, it's totally worth it.

This is what fall road trips are all about. The view from Cannon Mountain of the 38-acre Echo Lake, surrounded by colorful trees with leaves ready to blanket the ground, is just mind-blowing. Shot from somewhere along the 4,000-foot mountain, in New Hampshire this just sums up why Autumn is our favorite season.

The crown jewel of Maine’s scenic coastline is Acadia National Park, located just outside the bustling bayside town of Bar Harbor. It's also home to America's first sunrise on Cadillac Mountain. Read more >> Link in bio.

These statues continuously move against each other every day, passing by very close but never truly connecting. It's a perfect depiction of the romantic but truly tragic story of the 1937 Austrian Novel “Ali and Nino”… a tale of love between an Azerbaijani Muslim and a Georgian princess that tragically ended when Ali was killed during the first World War. The moving sculpture, also called the “Statue of Love”, was created by Georgian artist Tamara Kvesitadze and can be found in the small Black Sea resort city of Batumi in Georgia (the country, not the state)… . . . . . #aliandnino #batumi #saqartvelo #blacksea #discovertheroad #amazingworld #exploretheworld #travel #trip #wanderlust #travelgram #instatravel #traveling #roadtrips #travelphotography #beautifuldestinations #neverstopexploring #igtravel #instatraveling #exploremore #bucketlist #travelpics #globetrotter #visit #worldplaces #seetheworld #photography #bestoftheday #instagood #publicart
