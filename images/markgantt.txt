Be PATIENT and TRUST the PROCESS - That’s What the doctors and nurses kept saying at the @huntingtonhospital NICU the entire FIFTEEN DAYS Davis was there. Ironic that our son’s birth is the lesson we both struggle with the most. Davis’s persistence and strong will prevailed and he was out sooner than they had thought. He’s showing us that he’s his own person, unique in his journey and a blessing to watch him grow. #dadsofinstagram #deardavis #dadswagger #calm #dad #NICU #nicubaby #nicugrad #nicudad #nurses #doctor

As a new parent, I know that I would do anything to make sure Davis had a better life and a chance to live his dreams. I know that I would probably even risk my life if I could provide that opportunity. I can not imagine him separated from me, alone and scared. This administration shocks me daily. This is not the world I want to raise my son in. Please make a call. Use your voice for change. #dadsofinstagram #deardavis

— THREE GENERATIONS OF GANTT — I’m overwhelmed with all the feelings that parenthood has brought on. Today, I’m so grateful for parents who did such an amazing job at raising me. I think it’s easy for adults to look back at their past and say that their parents ‘Did the best they could’ in reference to a hardly perfect childhood. But now that we’re parents, I can’t take what they’ve done for granted anymore. Parenting is no joke. I didn’t know how to respond when friends said to ‘get sleep’, ‘go to a movie’, ‘say goodbye to this lifestyle’, and yet it’s so clear now. ****************** This photo was taken five hours after Davis was born. My Dad, Step-mom, Brother and his finance flew down to surprise us. At the time, they had no idea that Davis was in the NICU. We haven’t shared about that experience on social media yet, but we plan to in more depth. Davis’s first 48 hours were the most challenging and scariest of our entire life. #deardavis #fathersday #dadswagger #newagegents #babyboy #fatherhood #dadgoals #gratitude

It’s hard to believe it’s only been six and a half weeks. It feels like six months. I’m constantly trying to figure if we’re doing it right or if I’m going to be able to find a balance with him, @thebriannedavis and my career. I’m doing my best to stay present, let go of my fears and enjoy the time with him and Brianne and Bear of course. #DearDavis #BabyBoy #Dadswagger #dogsofinstagram #gratitude

#tbt at least 34 years ago. My mom (@facheryl) sent me a ton of photos, report cards and items from my past that my brother (@briangntt335 )found and memorabilia she kept over the years — mind blown. The photos of me growing up are crazy to see now that my son is here. No idea who shot this or where it is. Might have been at an AA meeting with my grandparents.

This guy has literally stolen our hearts. He is teaching me so much about myself and my capacity for love has grown exponentially over the longest six weeks in my life. It’s been at times a scary road so far but happy he’s home and healthy. #deardavis #dadswagger #dad #fatherhood #love #calm #gratitude

#FFT (Foreign Film Tuesday) LA NOTTE - Directed by Michelangelo Antonioni - I’m noticing that the majority of my favorite films, foreign or otherwise are about relationships. All the characters are always flawed and vulnerable. —- Synopsis: In Milan, Lidia (Jeanne Moreau) suddenly storms out of a posh gathering held to honor her husband, Giovanni (Marcello Mastroianni), who has just written a new novel. Distressed at the news that her friend Tommaso (Bernhard Wicki) has a terminal illness, Lidia begins roaming the streets of the city, questioning her marriage to Giovanni. Meanwhile, Giovanni, seemingly oblivious to his crumbling relationship with Lidia, attempts to seduce beautiful ingénue Valentina (Monica Vitti). #fft #director #writing #goals #gratitude #filmmaking

Just finished rereading #siddhartha - what a beautiful journey. . . “When someone seeks," said Siddhartha, "then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.” ― Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha #goals #filmmaking #director #writing #actor #bookstagram

#FFT (Foreign Film Tuesday) HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR - directed by Alain Resnais, with a screenplay by Marguerite Duras. It is the documentation of an intensely personal conversation between a French-Japanese couple about memory and forgetfulness. It was a major catalyst for the Left Bank Cinema, making highly innovative use of miniature flashbacks to create a uniquely nonlinear storyline. #goals #filmmaking #director #writing

Looking for a handful of women who, care about the issue of drug endangered children and can help us finance a kickass feature film that shines a spotlight on this issue. Contact me if you know anyone who should be invited!  Long before #metoo or #timesup, one woman found her voice in a man’s world and refused to be silenced.

My love. My heart. My best friend. Lucky 13. I didn’t know that a life like this was even possible. I didn't know I could love this much. Laugh this much. To have a partner that shows up when the going gets tough and there to remind me when things are actually working out. You’ve always inspired me by your passion and diligence in everything you do. I’m in awe of your talent, your capacity for love and your willingness to grow. I say this all the time, but it’s true — you make me want to be a better man. I look forward to the next thirteen years and getting old(er) with you, and experiencing this new chapter of our lives. #KeepSweetForeverMore #anniversary #love #relationshipgoals❤️

I’ve noticed I haven’t been taking photos of Bear since Beau passed. It’s been really difficult not having both of them in our lives. I miss the shit of Beau and wish he was still here. Bear seems to be taking over his brother’s old habits of begging and laying on five pillows at a time. Grateful to have this guy and his unconditional love. #dogsofinstagram #dogs #pups #grateful #gratitude

It breaks my heart to share that we lost sweet Beau today. He singlehandedly taught me unconditional love, patience, and brought me so much joy. I can't imagine what it will be like without you buddy but I know you are not in pain anymore and you will be watching over your brothers and us.
