Phantom Citrine. Back in May with the Taurus moon, I was feeling the need to get grounded. Went to my local new age shop and found this Phantom Citrine. (A Phantom Crystal occurs when the growth of a crystal is interrupted and then it continues to grow after—creating the “ghosts” within it.) What are your favorite crystals? #crystals #citrine #phantomquartz #spirituality

I love my journals. Irrationally. Brown Midori TN filled with my favorite inserts: TN inserts with Tomoe River paper. I love that for #morningpages and other journaling. The Chic Sparrow Mr. Darcy holds Moleskine Cahiers that I use for note-taking, research, writing first draft ideas. The Nude Filofax holds print-outs from online files that I can hole-punch. #amwriting #journaling #mtn #planneraddict #writerslife #midoritravelersnotebook, #chicsparrowmrdarcy, #nudefilofax

"At the center of your being, you have the answer." -Lao Tzu This is the foundation of all good coaching and spiritual awakenings. It's learning to get to the stillpoint to connect with the answer that's the hard part for most people. There are lots of ways of doing it. Meditation works for some.  Spiritual coaching, with questions followed by holding sacred space is really powerful too.  I've always used writing, journaling, to get there. But I've also just asked for guidance/signs and I've never been disappointed by the knock on the head I get as an answer. If you're an awakening midlife career woman wanting to reconnect to your soul and rediscover your creativity, join my free FB group to meet other spiritual women journeying to the center of their being to discover their answers. #embracethefeminine #noregrets #answerthecall #creativelife #empoweringwomen #midlifewomen #creativity #followyourbliss #highvibes #lawofattraction #writing #writinglife #designyourlife #bestlife #divinefeminine #divinefemininerising #journaling #womenempoweringwomen #motivationalquotes #manifestation #goalsetting #beyourbest #lifeisgood #creativewomen #spirituality #awakeningwomen #laotzu

Are you trying to shift your mindset or use affirmations, but you know it's not working because you don't really believe what you're saying or thinking? For example, you say "I am abundant" but then you think about your bank balance and you're really thinking, "no I'm not." That's when you use the "I am willing" phrase. I am willing to see evidence that I am abundant. I am willing to be open to the possibility that abundance flows freely to me. Those statements shift your energy towards more abundance, because they don't contradict your own subconscious thoughts. You can use the "I am willing" phrase on any limiting belief that you're trying to shift. What limiting belief will you shift with this phrase? Share it in the comments and help someone else shift. #vibrationalalignment #vibrationalenergy #lawofattraction #inthevortex #happinessisachoice #midlifewomen #womenempoweringwomen #designyourlife #abundancemindset

Practicing Loving Kindness meditation can increase your compassion for your self and all others. First repeat the mantras to yourself about yourself. Then you can say them for other people, our leaders, all beings on earth. May I be filled with lovingkindness May I be held in loving kindness… May I feel connected and calm… May I accept myself just as I am… May I be happy… May I know the natural joy of being alive… #meditation #rituals #peaceofmind #embracethefeminine #vibrationalalignment #vibrationalenergy #lovingkindness #lawofattraction #inthevortex #happinessisachoice #midlifewomen #womenempoweringwomen #designyourlife

I love Wayne Dyer. He was the first teacher who opened me to a completely different paradigm of reality. Because of him, I learned that magic is real and that we are abundant, powerful, I AM beings of energy. Abundance is not about money. It's tuning into a knowing that the scarcity mindset we've been living in is really false. We need to wake up and realize that we are all infinite powerful spiritual beings. Midlife women, you especially need to embrace your inner power and shine your light in the world. You have gifts and stories to share. What can you do today to FEEL abundant and start to tap into that energy?  #wisewomen #abundancemindset #waynedyer #spirituality #soultribe #lawofattraction #manifestation #designyourlife #empoweredmidlifewomen #embracethefeminine

On this July 4 holiday, I'm sharing this photo from Tom Coe on @unsplash of the Statue of Liberty, or as she is called in the namesake poem, Mother of Exiles. New Colossus Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” ----------- #4thofjuly #keepfamiliestogether #bethechange #inspiration #statueofliberty #independenceday #poetry

I use this mantra all the time to stay in surrendered trust that #theuniversehasmyback. We just spent a week in Iceland and travelling and then the weekend in Cooperstown, NY. There were so many magical things that happened: perfect timings, cancellations just before we needed reservations, perfect hosts for our AirBnB. No matter what is going on in your life, you can focus on calling in Ease & Flow. #positiveenergy #highvibes

Are you like many of the midlife women I work with who feel their heart calling them to soulful, creative, more meaningful work?  But then resistance, inner critics, procrastination, perfectionism, fear of not being good enough blocks you. "Your heart knows the way. RUN IN THAT DIRECTION." Even running starts with ONE STEP. What's one small step you can take today to follow your heart? #embracethefeminine #noregrets #answerthecall #creativelife #empoweringwomen #midlifewomen #creativity #spiritualcoach #followyourbliss #highvibes #smallstepstosuccess #lawofattraction #writing #writinglife  #designyourlife #bestlife #divinefeminine  #motivationalquotes #rumi #manifestation #beyourbest #lifeisgood #creativewomen

"You get there by realizing that you are already there." -Eckhart Tolle What does this mean? To me, it's remembering that all of my desires/big dreams/soul-goals come from my inner divine being, from my own vortex, and that the manifestation of all of them already exists.  Everything I need to manifest them into this reality is within me, within my mindset and the vibrational energy I emit.

Morning pages are sacred to me. It's a soul practice for me, along with pilates and morning meditation. Connecting to nature to feel grounded is also a practice I've started scheduling with intention since I moved from acres in the country to a downtown highrise. What are you doing this morning to feel grounded and to connect to your soul for inspired action this week?

It's Sunday night, going into Monday. Focus on what's SACRED in your life. What do you appreciate? What's most meaningful for you? How can you tap into those FEELINGS more often during the week? When you learn how to tap into those feelings during the week, the week will FEEL sacred to you.

Happy Saturday! My best friend/soulmate/husband is on a golf retreat this weekend, having a blast with the guys, I hope. One of the reasons we have an incredible deeply loving and romantic relationship after 27 years together is that we both respect each other's individuality, needs, desires, interests. I'm enjoying my own retreat:: writing, reading, artist's date, journaling, and family time with our sons and grandkids.

"Quiet the mind, and the soul will speak." Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati I love the rituals that quiet my mind. Morning pages, every morning, in my #mtn . It gets all the monkey mind stuff out of my head and gems appear. Meditations of all kinds: guided, brain entrainment, chanting, sound healing bowls, silent. Running, especially to kundalini mantras. Mindfulness practices: making coffee, pilates, folding laundry, walking hand-in-hand with my true love.

“The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.” -Mary Oliver Part of the Heroine's Journey for midlife women is the awakening of this urgent call to the creative work they cast aside for most of their adult lives as they pursued careers and prioritized family. Many women feel the call to write, paint, journal, collage or to serve others through passion projects, heart-centered businesses, or volunteer work. Some get stuck thinking they are too old to be creative or aren't good enough to write/paint/serve/share their talents with the world. DON'T BE THAT WOMAN.  As the years go by, the regret will settle into your bones and suck the joy out of you. I know this is a vibrational planet, and, in spite of how it might seem politically, the vibration of the collective unconscious is rising and creating huge shifts in our experiences.  We each contribute to that vibrational energy.  The most important thing you can do is BE JOYFUL. Answer the divine calling to YOUR creative work. For yourself, and for all of us! #embracethefeminine #noregrets #answerthecall #creativelife #empoweringwomen #midlifewomen #creativity #followyourbliss #highvibes #collectiveunconscious #lawofattraction #lawofattraction #writing #writinglife #womensupportingwomen #maryoliver #designyourlife #bestlife #divinefeminine #divinefemininerising #womenempoweringwomen #motivationalquotes #manifestation #goalsetting #beyourbest #lifeisgood #creativewomen

"Indeed, learning to write may be part of learning to read. For all I know, writing comes out of a superior devotion to reading.” ― Eudora Welty, On Writing I don't have many memories of my childhood. My brother can remember all kinds of details about events that happened, but I can't. My mother says that's because I always had my nose in a book. I can remember the books. What do you do with devotion? #amwriting #readingislife #readabook #ilovewriting #authorlife #wisewomenwriting #devotion

YES, this is sooo me. Is it you? I've heard creatives say that it HURTS if they aren't creating, and I get that. Because it hurts my soul. If I'm not creating, I'm drifting away from who I am and who I came here to BE, the energy I came here to share. Is your soul calling you to BE creative, reminding you that you have a light to shine? Are you ready to embrace it and answer that calling? Join our Wise Women Satsung for midlife women manifesting inner radiance, outer magic, and soulful creative projects.

Harness the power of habits to make change in your own life. Gretchen Rubin #happiness #habits #self-help #personaldevelopment #manifestmiracles #miraclemorning #goals It's simple but not easy to change habits. Creating rituals that include habits that raise your vibrational level and help you stay aligned with your soul is the foundation for changing your life. Finding a day planner or scheduling system that works for you is an important tool to keep you on track. You can download my FREE planner from my website. It's designed to help you access alignment with your soul-goals and take daily steps toward them. Link in profile.

Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in & day out. #success #goals #productivity #inspiration #personal development #accessalignment #manifestmiracles It truly is the daily habits that create change in your life. Small rituals, chosen with intention, that create alignment with your deepest desires. That is how you manifest miracles and live your highest expansion. What small efforts are you making today to BE the person you intend to be, to live the life of your highest expanded version of yourself?

I appreciate mornings because of my Miracle Morning routine. #mornings #affirmations #miraclemorning #accessalignment #dailyhabits #success #personaldevelopment #appreciation #morningpages #manifestmiracles I have never been a morning person. Even so, I would wake up early to write my Morning Appreciation Pages and do my pilates workout. Then I read The Miracle Morning and started incorporating strategies from Think & Grow Rich into my morning routines. Soon, I started to look forward to waking up in the mornings. I followed this morning ritual while I was manifesting my dream penthouse last year, and now I'm still using it to follow my desires.

Radiate gratitude. #inspiration #positivity #gratitude #grateful #soulwhispers What are you grateful for today? You can always find something, no matter how simple it might be. Tuning into graitude and appreciation raises your vibrational energy. That not only makes you feel peaceful & happy, it also attracts more into your life to be grateful for!

I LOVE books. I use them for inspiration, to name photographs & art, as creativity jumpstarters for my own writing. Since I moved and now have a 30 minute drive, I always have a non-fiction book to listen to for the drive.  Right now, it's Elizabeth Gilbert's BIG MAGIC. I actually look forward to my commute each day. Then I have a mystery for night reading before bed. I just finished reading Laura Lippman's entire series about Tess Monaghan, a Baltimore private eye. Now I'm reading Louise Penny mysteries set in Three Pines. What are you reading/listening to??? #books #reading #bookworm #bookaholic #readinglist #WhatToRead #mysteries #nonfiction

The starting point of all achievement is desire. I love that Napolean Hill said this so many years ago. Our desires get a bad rap in today's culture, like it's selfish or greedy to focus on your desires. Desires are divinely inspired. I'm talking about soul-desires here, not ego-desires. There is a difference. Learning that difference is part of the path to enlightenment. #happiness #instagood #quotes #inspiration #desire #desiremap #love #embracethefeminine #soulwhispers #accessalignment #manifestmiracles

This is a mantra that I use everyday.  In my journal in the morning, I write "I appreciate ease + flow + abundance." If I have a potentially stressful meeting or situation, I'll appreciate ease + flow for it ahead of time. For my big dream goals, I create "ease + flow" mantras to manifest them.  #happiness #instagood #mantra #affirmations #inspiration  #embracethefeminine  #accessalignment #manifestmiracles

"I said to my soul, be still and wait without hope, for hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love, for love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith, but the faith and the love are all in the waiting. Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing." T.S.

Have you forgotten how to dream big, imagine possibilities, and tap into their inner wisdom? Or maybe you can see a vision but don't believe you can achieve it. The power of coaching is cocreative magic that unfolds as I hold space for your dreams and believe in your divinity.

Sending love to all women on Mother's Day.  To those who are raising children or honoring their own mothers. To those who have lost mothers.  To those who have lost a child from death or from estrangement. This holiday was originally created to honor mothers who lost a child in war, a truly noble cause. It has become a commercialized holiday that causes a great deal of pain to many women, myself included. To all of those women, I send love.
