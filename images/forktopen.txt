Ever have one of those days when you put your diet on hold and just say “screw it, YOLO!” Yeah well. As much as I loved these cinnamon donuts with their delicious caramel sauce sometimes it’s just not worth it to sacrifice something you’ve worked so hard for so instead you look at the photo and think about what could be. Do you want to go through life looking like a cinnamon donut or its skinnier version - the churro? 🤔😑😰😭

Today, we celebrate milk’s favorite cookie. Happy #NationalOreoDay to the best selling cookie in the world! Here are a few dunk worthy stats that’ll twist your cookie: 1.) More than 450 billion cookies have been sold since their debut in 1912 2.) The cookie was developed on March 6th, 1912 in Chelsea, Manhattan, NY. 3.) The first flavor variety was lemon filled but it was quickly discontinued 4.) Nobody really knows where the name Oreo comes from 5.) There is an Android operating system named “Oreo” and no, it’s not edible #sponsored #krogeroreo

I remember following the @crepesbonaparte truck all over Orange County just for one bite of their delicious crepes. I’m so happy they’ve permanently found a home in Downtown Fullerton and I no longer have to chase them down. Now, the only thing I need to do is run around the block or something after eating a few of these - especially this HazelBerryAna. A crepe stuffed with fresh strawberries, sliced banana, and Nutella topped with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle 😋

Popcorn is meant for sharing - whether it be with a close friend, family or the one you love. Some of my fondest memories come from sharing a bowl of popcorn. This year, I plan to share this bucket of butter, cheese and caramel popcorn by @popcornfactory with my best friend - and someone I’m also deeply in love with because he’s always the first that comes to mind when I want to share something. Who will you share with? And what’s your favorite popcorn memory? #sharetheseason #ad 🍿

Brunch is my 2nd favorite part of the day especially when Breakfast Flatbread is on the menu. Jimmy’s Famous American Tavern serves theirs up with applewood smoked bacon, sausage, eggs, fontina cheese, potatoes and chives.

Let’s chat about my weekend brunch at @andreisirvine and this Arugula Salad that I think deserves a better name. Why? Because it’s got a tempura fried egg. 😵 It’s a must try on the brunch menu 😋
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/86b67c453ab20d5a815524c2d0ac92f9/5BD31CBB/t51.2885-15/e35/23161698_836457026516177_35019063092576256_n.jpg

The theme of the week appears to be purple. Starting TODAY, you can get an ube latte, an ube croissant and an ube cookie at Dough & Arrow in Costa Mesa. I was lucky enough to preview them ALL today and they are all amazeballs! 😋#doughandarrow

I swear I didn’t order this drink because it’s purple. 😂 But milk tea is one of my all time favs and when I heard that Mio Tea House only uses fresh taro in their drinks, I had to get the Taro Milk Tea. 😋 Starting October 28th-29th, you can get a drink of your choice & another one for free so make sure you stop in soon!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1305f96a6cdfaa5039e3793acac1d6f5/5BD87397/t51.2885-15/e35/22708660_1356703924455693_2916346651557756928_n.jpg

It’s hard to believe these are gluten free and I honestly wouldn’t have known if not told. Enjoy these muffins and other sweets at Flower Child in Santa Monica.

Not gonna lie. I could eat a slice or more of this pie right now. It’s been a crazy emotional week and a Mom’s Apple Crumble with the perfect cup of coffee or milk tea sounds amazing.

If you’re trying to eat healthier, like me, you’ll be delighted to know that a place that labels itself “Wicked Cow Burgers and Brew” also serves salads.

#flashbackfriday to #tastela. It's my 2nd year attending and my 2nd taste of this amazing Surf & Turf burger by @slapfish. I swear, it gets better with each bite. Special thanks to the amazing and beautiful @lauren_gruel for hooking it up with this picture perfect masterpiece so I could get my shot. You're the best!

The @ocweekly claims @kraveasianfusion's garlic noodles are better than @anqibistro so naturally, I had to try them for myself. Verdict: 🤷🏻‍♀️

The Hornitos tequila booth at the #tastela was serving up refreshing drinks all weekend like these Palomas and Margaritas. 😋🍹

And...that's a wrap for #tastela. Another exciting food and wine fest for the books. This year, there was a heavy emphasis on light seafood fare like this Hamachi Tartar by @montagebh with mint, sesame seeds, avocado mousse, and a tangerine reduction.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0b13ac0d10ed6ede1f9f110713ed4431/5BCC5669/t51.2885-15/e35/21372831_114981659189088_1197094483036995584_n.jpg
There's an excessive heat warning for the weekend but I braved the heat for the first session of the #tastela #fieldtofork. Luckily @mcconnellsicecreams was their to help cool me down with their Hibiscus Lime and Mexican Chocolate Sorbet ice cream. 😋🍦
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a6633199f764688bf3b3339b54b1dcaa/5BC8D04F/t51.2885-15/e35/21227411_341624559610367_8245554755472982016_n.jpg
#TasteLA is probably one of my favorite events. I was excited to attend again this year. Featured here is the Oxtail Donut from Restauration - a salted donut with oxtail jam and black garlic salsify purée. This yummy bite was from the first session #fieldtofork.

When it comes to ice cream, I can be a bit indecisive. All those flavors - which one to choose? 🤔 Luckily, at Chunk N Chip, their flight of four solves that problem for you! Featured here is the Banana Cream Pie, Strawberry, Black Currant, and Lucky Charms. 😋
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a279258c7d6e99f94770a1d0742c560d/5BD1CEAF/t51.2885-15/e35/21224612_1398539996932213_269066103227940864_n.jpg

I know it's 1am and technically the next day but is this still considered a night cap? D'Vine serves up this amazing black tea with mint or coffee infused with cardamom to end your perfect meal on the right note but don't just take my word for it - go try it yourself!

Celebrate #TacoTuesday with these amazing grilled shrimp & beer battered fish tacos at Chronic Tacos new location in Tustin! I recently had a chance to check it out and loved how I could customize the menu.

"Save room for dessert" was the first thing Chef Walid recommended. When have I not?! This Layalee Lubnan at D'Vine is a fragrant dessert that is made of semolina pudding topped with whipped cream and drizzled with crushed pistachios and sugar syrup.

Anytime is a good time for #breakfast especially on a lazy Sunday. If you're looking for a healthier alternative, check out Sharky's new breakfast menu (only in Studio City). Pictured here are the Stacked Breakfast Enchiladas - non GMO corn tortillas topped with tomatillo cheese sauce, organic eggs, spinach, and pico de gallo.

If all veggies looked and tasted this good, I wouldn't have any problems getting my daily serving. Luckily that isn't really an issue at D'Vine because everything Chef Walid puts on a plate is pure perfection, made with love and served up fresh. This dish in particular is their beet salad - find it on their cold mezzas menu. It's a simple mix of beets, olive oil, lemon juice and salt.

I just had a pretty amazing dinner but I could probably find some stomach space for this tray of brownies. Sweet Lady Jane bakery had an impressive display of baked goods at last weekend's Newport Beach Wine and Food Festival. #NBWFF #NEWBEFEST
