Popcorn is meant for sharing - whether it be with a close friend, family or the one you love. Some of my fondest memories come from sharing a bowl of popcorn. This year, I plan to share this bucket of butter, cheese and caramel popcorn by @popcornfactory with my best friend - and someone I‚Äôm also deeply in love with because he‚Äôs always the first that comes to mind when I want to share something. Who will you share with? And what‚Äôs your favorite popcorn memory? #sharetheseason #ad üçø

Peas aren't really my thing but my +1 told me to take a chance. I think we're both glad we did. This Baked Penne will make you forget all about your hatred for peas, at least it did for me. Especially when it's combined with sweet fennel sausage, grana padano, and a tomato cream sauce. üòã

Celebrate #TacoTuesday with these amazing grilled shrimp & beer battered fish tacos at Chronic Tacos new location in Tustin! I recently had a chance to check it out and loved how I could customize the menu.

"Save room for dessert" was the first thing Chef Walid recommended. When have I not?! This Layalee Lubnan at D'Vine is a fragrant dessert that is made of semolina pudding topped with whipped cream and drizzled with crushed pistachios and sugar syrup.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/34a3a3e86887cb0f459eaf9a7c9f942e/5BDBB491/t51.2885-15/e35/14449286_259263901137711_8468529550307885056_n.jpg
Anytime is a good time for #breakfast especially on a lazy Sunday. If you're looking for a healthier alternative, check out Sharky's new breakfast menu (only in Studio City). Pictured here are the Stacked Breakfast Enchiladas - non GMO corn tortillas topped with tomatillo cheese sauce, organic eggs, spinach, and pico de gallo.

If all veggies looked and tasted this good, I wouldn't have any problems getting my daily serving. Luckily that isn't really an issue at D'Vine because everything Chef Walid puts on a plate is pure perfection, made with love and served up fresh. This dish in particular is their beet salad - find it on their cold mezzas menu. It's a simple mix of beets, olive oil, lemon juice and salt.
