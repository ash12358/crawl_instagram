Cats of the courtyard, an update: having not seen him for months now, I suspect Mr. Scruff has gone on to his well-earned reward in the next life. Everybody meet The Odinson, who I believe is taking over his territory.

Foreign Oreos (Foreigneos? Foreos? Oreigners?) from Ecuador supplied by the inimitable @msh 1. They tasted a lot like the strawberry ones released many years ago that for some reason never caught on, except these had a slight hint of saltiness on the back end? 2. I'm glad that the Oreo people, like me, consider 4 to be a single serving

Opportunities for cross-marketing aside, I am mystified as to why these exist: minus the slight crispiness of the wafer peculiar to some of the specialty flavors, these are almost indistinguishable from standard-issue Oreos taste-wise. Honestly. Also the stamped sides are fun, I guess??

Be forewarned: if you leave your front door open, he'll walk right on in like he owns the place, and if he happens to be on top of your car while you're getting your kid's carseat out, he will not hesitate to use your personal body to climb back down.

Got a mystery that needs documenting here. I took Quentin for a roll around the neighborhood in his stroller (the carseat clicks into the stroller frame, very convenient) and he 1. was under this blanket the whole time 2. was securely strapped in and never left the seat or even woke up, really. WHERE THE HELL IS HIS OTHER SOCK. He had them both on when we left the house and now I can only find one. If anyone sees a tiny sock with a whale on it somewhere around Elmwood, let a man know
