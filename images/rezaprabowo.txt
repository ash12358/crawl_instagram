Completely in love with the new @Oakley Flight Jacket. The top-less rim design looks stunning and gave me a better clearance when riding in the drops, and the  Advancer actually works (i was a bit skeptical) to remove fog from the lens. Definitely liking this more than the Jawbreaker because it doesn‚Äôt look too wide on my narrow face. ‚Ä¢ #oakley #flightjacket #roadcycling #cycling #sunglasses #honestreview #notpaid #shotoniphonex

Had an absolutely surreal experience watching Nils Frahm last night at the Esplanade. The concert was deep, dark, and introverted. It felt like i was holding my breathe in an emotional roller-coaster. This could probably just be the best live music experience i‚Äôve ever had.

Got a satisfying result from Powerman. The power curve shows that my pacing strategy works, the line is relatively flat from 30 min to the end of the ride.

Casually finishing a #duathlon race last weekend. . Although she hasn't ridden the bike professionally for several years, her grit and cadence still show decades of training that she endured as a (national) athlete. Ain't nothing stopping this one. . Proud of you @farezaudi! . Next stop: casual triathlon (for you), while i'm going to go back to singular sport. #Multisport is just not for me üòú

The idea behind Katya2 is to build a bike with top of the line performance parts, without asking a lot of attention. Dark, mysterious, and effortlessly beautiful.

I am at a time where i want to focus on releasing my full potential, yet still living life quite effortlessly. I want to live in a place where i don't need to think about unnecessary details because everything has been taken care of for you. Where things are moving at a considerably fast speed, and opportunity to become a #worldclass designer presents itself. _ Are we robots? You might think so. Boring? Maybe. But i sure don't mind this. For now at least.

Really miss the natural aspirated engines though.

You can ride in the middle of the night and virtually nothing gonna harm you. Your cycling route will always be around. Lights are on. Traffic is barely there.

First trip for #Katya2 was quite epic. We didn't expect to do this much offroading but sometimes we just can't help overcoming the temptation. _ But all is well, riding a billion dollar #irideenve carbon wheelset wasn't a problem, and those wireless electronic #sram #etap won't give you any trouble as long as you don't forget to charge them before the ride. _ So, what's next? #MyCanyon #canyonbikes #canyonultimate #outsideisfree #actuallyyouneedtopay #bali #nothingisfree #roadbike #roadcycling #beach

Day two of our #BijiBali ride, we were hungry for a bit more climb. So to the north we went, marking Mt. Batur as our course destination on our #Garmin. _ After reaching the end of the hill climb we were greeted by the magnificent mountain and lake. We thought, how about doing a circle around the mountain as our salutation, only to be suprised by the brutalistic beauty and rawness of the surrounding landscape. _ We found a few 23% slippery climbs that stopped us on our track and get us on our feet and walking our bikes. Even the great Mt. Wuling didn't manage to bring me down. _ Most of the route wasn't paved. But we all know, where the tarmac ends, the fun begins. And rest assured, we'll be back for more. _ #roadbike #roadcycling #outsideisfree #epicride #mycanyon #iamspecialized #ritcheylogic #piascycles

Day One of our #BijiBali ride. It has been a while since i had a long ride with this bunch. Since i decided to move out of the country, I only had a handful of chance to ride with them, so we always try to make the best of it. _ Prior to the ride, some of us actually participated in the #MBM #BaliMarathon doing a Half Marathon, so we didn't want to be too ambitious on our first day of riding. We decided to head east to #Amed, with a healthy tiny bump of a hill to warm our legs for the next day of riding. _ On the way back from Amed we saw a sign for "Virgin Beach". And being a group of riders well known for not doing things according to plan, we can't manage to stop ourselves from swerving from the main road and found ourselves in a single-track offroad course heading to the beach. And boy are we in for a treat. White sand beach with virtually just us and the bikes and a couple of local who hosted the premises. Heck, it was always worth the effort.

I couldn't be more proud of you, @farezaudi. _ Completing your first marathon with a sub-5 finish of 4:50:31 didn't really suprised me since I've never seen anyone train as disciplined as you are. And all that hard work truly culminated in your steady pace throughout the hilly course. _ It won't take long till you get a sub 4:30 finish, and i'll have a lot to catch up. For more marathons to come üçª!

It's not always fun and game when we cycle. Most of the time it's painful. Ridiculous slopes, violent headwind, rough patches of road, weather turns against you, flat tires, broken wheels, land slides, dogs chasing, or you're just not performing and the finish line feels like it's still a hundred miles away. _ A lot suffering involved in this sport if you're doing it properly.

It's good to be home, but memories of #Taiwan climbs will remain deep in the inner tissues of both of my legs. On last year's trip to Japan we went far, 600km Tokyo - Kyoto. But this time we're aiming to go high, 6000m of elevation gain in 3 days, with less than 300km recorded on our Garmin. Wuling, Hualien, Yilan, Taipei, now bears our name. _ Some say Taiwan hosts some of the toughest climb in Asia, i suspect that claim is true.

I've never ridden up this high in my cycling career. 3600m elevation is as high as climbing Rinjani or Semeru, and we did it from sea level. Won't be able to do it if it wasn't for the support from the DF boys @iamnicholasng and @dkc189, and also Mr. Zhang our super-soigneur. _ Now if i may lay down a bit.

We started at sea level, and the ride was all fun and game, 5-6% average gradient, but only until 2000m. After that, we have to step up and put on our game face, because what apparently was waiting for us are 16-20% gradients ready to bust our legs out. _ Tempreature dropped from a mild 27¬∞ to a chilly 8¬∞, plus it was pouring rain. The #Rapha Race Cape came handy at times like these. And the oxygen level was so thin after 3000m, i started to feel dizzy.

Casual Sunday Climbs with the Dangling Fireballs lads. Manage to get 1000m elevation in this so-called-flat island of ours.

Because you will never have too many @canyon_bikes. My third #MyCanyon will be an upgrade for the current #Ultimate CF SL, stepping up to the SLX, And dressing it up with the latest wireless-electronic groupset from @sramroad, the #SRAM Red #etap. No more wrangling cables and wires, and just a clean line with nothing but radio waves to shift. Even thinking about it tickle my balls. Not to mention the added aero goodness from the new frame design + H36 integrated stem and bar. _ The SLX will be weighing at 6.3kg, which means that it will be 900 grams lighter than my current setup. And for someone with a Quintana-esque form, that is more than good enough. Just need to steal some FTP from Nairo, that's all. _ Now, if you will excuse me, i'm going to drop into my cryogenic chamber and sleep the whole way till Katya SLX comes.

The rain did make the track a bit more tricky, but it also dissipated the heat, making the #powerman #duathlon #race much much more bearable.

I managed to overtake a few other amateur TT riders, altho i did got overtaken by @doeljkt. But you just can't beat that guy. üòù _ Good fun! Can't wait to do another #TT race on the @canyon_bikes #MyCanyon #Speedmax. Thanks @asiatrilive for the awesome üì∑.

Skye did a fantastic job on last week's #Powerman Indonesia #Duathlon. I was a bit hesitant on the first few kilometers since it's raining quite heavily, but #MyCanyon #Speedmax #TimeTrial proven to be a very reliable steed in any condition. Very stable in the fast corners and U-turns, and wasn't too affected by the numerous speed bumps throughout the track. I have a feeling that i haven't seen her full potential just yet. _ Clocked in at 1 hour 49 minutes for the 60 kilometers route, averaging at 32kph. Time to get back to the gym and do some more leg works. _ @canyon_bikes #Speedmax #tt #itt #tribike #kask #bambino #race #rapha #aero #nodrafting #solo #cycling #roadcycling #garmin #stravacycling

Good thing about living in Singapore is that the traffic is relatively safer than most cities in the region, making it less painful to ride a #TimeTrial bicycle. I wouldn't even think about getting myself a #ttbike if i'm still living in Indo. _ I ‚ù§Ô∏è #Singapore _ #MyCanyon #Speedmax #TTbros #tt

Long stretch of escalating road, just you and your trusted two wheels. The sound of your breath, drying chains, and rubber against the asphalt. Legs are screaming, arms and shoulders are numb, but somehow, you can't stop smiling. They say you can't tell the difference between the joy of cycling from insanity, and i guess they're right. And you won't understand unless you're one. _ 2500m of elevation gained, just to say hello to the great Fuji, somewhere behind that thick mist.

Ending the weekend with a proper 10km trail run at MacRitchie. This place never failed (to make me soaking wet at the end of the run). üòÖ #zoomelite8 #trailrun #macritchie #singapore #justrunlah

First group ride with the Dangling Fireballs boys on the #Speedmax #TimeTrial. Have gotten a bit used to it, and the result is fantastic. Definitely still have some room for improvement, but getting 23 PBs on #Strava doesn't hurt either. _ Loving #MyCanyon! _ #canyonbikes @canyon_bikes _ üì∑ @dkc189

You can either cling to nostalgia and try to fix it as much as you can, or you can start fresh and see what the future holds. _ Singapore, you may not be perfect, and i sacrificed a lot to be here. But we dance at the same rhythm, to the correct tunes, and sometimes that's the only thing that matters. And we may still be in our honeymoon phase, but nevertheless, thank you for a great first year. _ I think we'll do just fine. #citylove

Day 1 of our #Bintan300 #LunarRide. We found this sand dune and can't resist the temptation for a photo. Manage to get 95k from what is supposed to be 105k. We had to take a shortcut after experiencing a crash. Ended up finishing the ride in pitch black. All is well, @xtoredy is recovering from the bruises, and hoping the second day will be crash free. #roadbike #MyCanyon #specializedbikes
