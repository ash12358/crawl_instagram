I was lucky enough to visit one evening earlier this week. I’ve been down there a few times, and I’m left speechless every single time. One of nature’s greatest events. #thatsalottabats #ididascience

My wife gave me this amazing gift today. Harrison and I recreated a photo of me and my dad from when I was a baby. I can’t describe how much this meant to me. Like many people, Father’s Day is bittersweet for me. It’s my first as a dad myself, and my second since my dad died of brain cancer in 2016. Seeing these photos reminds me how much I miss him, but it also reminds me how great a dad he was. Looking at Harrison’s smile in this photo tells me I’m doing an okay job. Thanks dad ❤️

This is like finding a dang unicorn, y’all! I found a white bluebonnet while out on a run! White bluebonnets are uncommon, but occasionally a mutation prevents production of the Texas state flower’s trademark blue pigment. These pale beauties are fleeting, though. It’s likely that these white flowers will be pollinated by pollen from a normal blue flower. Since the white mutation arises randomly and is recessive, chances are the seeds from this plant will produce blue flowers next year. I’ll be back to check on this spot in 2019! #nature #txwildflowers2018 #bluebonnets #flowers

The wildflowers are out in Texas! Time for a couple of my favorite nature stories!! 🔴Carpets of bluebonnets are a fairly typical sight around here, but you’ll often find one of Texas’ other famous flowers mixed in… the red Castilleja, or Indian Paintbrush. You’ll never see Paintbrushes growing by themselves, though. Why? Because they are parasites! Under the surface they inject special sharp roots called haustoria into other plants’ roots to steal nutrients, especially in poor soil. They’re a pretty parasite at least, but you’ll probably never look at them the same way. Another fun fact? The red parts of the bloom are actually a type of modified leaf. The flowers are tucked way inside and are actually pretty unremarkable looking. 🔵 Paintbrushes are often found growing among (and feeding from) bluebonnets. This is because bluebonnets are lupines, a member of the pea family. These plants are able to grab nitrogen, even in poor soils, thanks to symbiotic bacteria in their roots (which is why the paintbrushes love to steal from them). This ability to grow in just about any dirt is why bluebonnets are so ubiquitous along our roadsides this time of year. Hopefully you’ll never be able to look at a wildflower patch like this the same way again. There’s a lot more than pollination going on! #txwildflowers2018 #nature #flowers

Hard to sneak up on something if it’s literally got eyes in the back of its head. Spotted this green lynx spider (Peucetia viridans) patrolling my wildflower patch, probably lying in wait for some tiny moth, bee, fly or other pollinator to get too close. With that disguise, I’ll bet this spider didn’t have any trouble finding dinner. #spider #txwildflowers2018 #nature #scenesfrommygarden 📷 on #iphone8plus with @olloclip macro

“You’ve made this day a special day, by just your being you. There’s no person in the whole world like you; and I like you just the way you are.” #misterrogers50 Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood made its national debut 50 years ago today, and generations of kids (including me) are better because he came into our lives every day. This was just a quote at the end of a children’s show, but it is one of life’s most important lessons. We are all rare and valuable, and the world is a better place when we express our uniqueness and care for one another. Live with empathy, and remember what Fred said: “There is something of yourself that you leave in every meeting with another person.”

Stopped for gas while driving through West Texas, sleepy and bored because it’s West Texas, and these perfect snowflakes started landing all around me. These beautiful assemblies of water’s unique polarity almost made it worth getting out of the nice warm car when it was 15°F ❄️💙

I’m kicking off 2018 with thoughts of unity, hoping that instead of arguing that the other side is evil, finding no common ground, we can find a way to coexist… two sides, red and green, on the same plate 🌶✌️#newmexico #adovada #chilecapitaloftheworld

The way that bluebonnet leaves catch water is one of my absolute favorite little treasures nature has to offer. The unique five-spoke shape and the hydrophobic hairs guide dew or raindrops to collect in one big, fat light-bending jewel. I’m not certain that it has a function, but it seems like an effective way to channel water down near your roots. Either way, it’s beautiful, and a good reason to keep looking down 🌱💦💙

Got this awesome explorer-inspired 24-hour watch from the folks at Kosmos 24. These watches were originally worn by cosmonauts, because 12-hour timekeeping doesn’t cut it when you’re in space. Check out https://www.kosmos-24.com for more! ⌚️🕒🕕🕘🕛

Nobody tell @drafthouse that we snuck a photo during the movie, but Harrison clearly loved seeing The Last Jedi today! Thank you for offering Alamo For All screenings so mom and dad could actually see the movie in theaters (and we could make this great family memory) #babysfirststarwar #tinyjedi #cuterthanporgs

This is a 20 million-year-old spider trapped in amber. I was lucky enough to hold this bit of ancient life in my hands recently and I was blown away by how much this spider looks like spiders today! It just shows how successful this group of animals has been during their 300 million year history on Earth. Lots of people don’t like spiders (and I used to be one of them), but if you watch my newest video on It’s Okay to be Smart about the awesomeness of spiders and the webs they spin, I bet you’ll change your mind 🤓🕷 LINK IN MY PROFILE!

Sometimes life gives us bridges to cross and sometimes life gives us bridges to take a picture of on our morning run because they look particularly pretty in the early light and come to think of it we don’t really have big old bridges back in Austin so this is neat. #bridgevibes

MUTANTS! Noticed a couple weird plants around my house this week. Awesome, huh? This Rudbeckia 🌼 and strawberry 🍓 show a phenomenon called fasciation. Normally the growing tip of a plant (stem cell-like tissue called the apical maristem) maintains a cylindrical shape as cells divide and become stems, leaves, flower parts, and even the flesh of some fruits. But if those maristem cells become randomly mutated, the growing tip can flatten out and spread into strange elongated or two-headed shapes. Still beautiful (and delicious) though 😋 Next time you pass a flower patch or buy strawberries, look for some fasciated mutants!

Zodiacal light, with bonus Pleiades! After twilight, the disk of dust leftover from the formation of our solar system is illuminated by the sun from beneath the horizon. That triangle is only visible in the darkest places on Earth, of which there are fewer and fewer. This has been one of my dream shots. Glad I got to finally capture it out in the dark skies of West Texas.

Before the internet, @nasa printed books to commemorate all their super-cool space missions. This was the last launch of the Mercury program and the final mission that JFK saw completed before his assassination. I'm a total sucker for this 1960s-era space print media aesthetic 👨‍🎨👨‍🚀

Geologists call these rocks columnar jointed basalt. I think they also make very nice art. When basaltic lava cools slowly and contracts, it sometimes fractures into ordered polygonal columns like these, each usually having 3-6 sides. This naturally-occurring pattern almost makes them look manufactured, which is why many natural basalt column formations are attributed to the work of giants or spirits, such as Ireland's Giant's Causeway or Wyoming's Devils Tower. These columns were spotted at @chinatifoundation in Marfa, TX. They formed naturally in nature, but were arranged in sculpture by artist Robert Irwin. A fine melding of art and science 🤓👍 don't you think?

👏👏👏Let's give it up for lichens, some of the toughest and most intriguing life forms on this here blue dot. When evolution was handing out niches, these symbiotic growths of fungi and photosynthetic cyanobacteria were like "No, you take the dirt and the water and all the other good places… we are happy just growing directly on the sheer face of a giant boulder or something… don't worry about us!" 💪🏔✊️Its estimated that up to SIX percent of Earth's surface is covered with lichens! I swear, if there's any life form on Earth that could survive on another planet, it's lichens. And tardigrades. #nature #biology #macro by @olloclip

Spring has arrived in Austin! 🌷🌼🌸 Gaillardia pulchella (AKA Indian blanket… I kinda hate that name, but alas) are coming out in force in my garden. Blooms like this in the daisy/sunflower family *look* like individual flowers, but there's actually dozens of individual flowers on a single bloom, the central "disc flowers" and the colorful "ray flowers" that we'd normally think of as petals. This gives the plant more pollination opportunities per bloom! In a few weeks, they'll join bluebonnets and paintbrushes in an explosion of color across central Texas. Can't wait! #nature #wildflowers #austin #texas
