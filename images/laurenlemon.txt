I was invited by @wimbledon to photograph their grounds before the big matches next week. It‚Äôs such a prestigious brand and competition, I could feel the energy brewing as soon as I walked in to the courts - I can only imagine how it must feel full of thousands of people. I was able to catch practice sessions by some of the best players in the world, even if I‚Äôm not able to stick around for the actual events next week. Someday I‚Äôll be back for the tournament, until then I had a lot of fun making pictures in the best sunny weather here. #ad

A little break from my travel images to show you this small series of photos I created for @ICP and their Talk In Images series - aimed at creating a visual conversation around a variety of topics. I was invited to be the conversation starter this month, with the theme of Hope. - To me, hope is the future. While I may not be a parent myself, I look at the children around me and think about how much they have ahead of them. Imagining these tiny kids growing up to be doctors, politicians, artists, inventors, creators, or anything is hopeful. With the support of their parents and peers they can do anything. - I now nominate a few of my favorite photographers @jungletimer, @laurenmarek, and @jacobjonasthecompany to share their images of Hope. If you'd like to participate as well, please add images with your interpretation of the theme and tag them #ICPTalkInImagesHope.

Roberto has lived and worked on his farm for 50 years, and was one of the first local farmers to push for a sustainability program for the coffee industry in Colombia. The Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality‚Ñ¢ Program ensures the highest quality coffee and sustainable farming practices, but also invests in farmer welfare and works towards enhancing the benefits for future generations of farmers. . In 2003 @NespressoUSA developed the AAA Sustainable Quality Program together with the @RainforestAlliance, a nonprofit organization. Through the program, Nespresso invests in training, financing and technical assistance to bring sustainable practices to farmers to ensure the highest quality coffee for years to come. As a result, farmers develop long-term relationships with Nespresso, improve their businesses, and ultimately their lives, families and communities. . I‚Äôm posting more to my stories, a deeper glimpse into Roberto‚Äôs colorful home, farm, and way of life.  #sponsored

This is the first in a series of photos I created working with @NespressoUSA to document the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality‚Ñ¢ Program & the coffee farming process. We got to know the farmers who have dedicated so much of their lives growing the highest quality coffee. These men opened up their homes, introduced us to their families, and taught us all about what they do. I will never sip coffee the same again and feel so grateful I was able to learn from these open, and warm-hearted people. . Don Ruben is a coffee farmer in Colombia, and is one of only two people who works daily to plant, grow, and care for the highest quality of crops on his farm. Only hiring extra help during the harvest season, Don Ruben comes from a long line of coffee farmers on this land. Inheriting the farm from his parents, and grandparents before that. . I‚Äôm sharing more in my Stories from my experience with these farmers and what I learned about the process. I hope you take a look! #sponsored

If you watched my Stories this weekend you caught that I finally got to visit the magical land of @meow__wolf - where we explored and played like children, and tried to make sense of this story and place. Whatever you‚Äôve heard about it - the hype is real. I love immersive art, yet this was nothing like I had ever experienced before. So you all should go, I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. And if you‚Äôve never heard of it before, even better...you should definitely go! üòâüîÆ‚ú®

Living in Los Angeles, I sometimes forget how incredible this season can be - we just don‚Äôt get colors like this in the Fall! I was so thrilled as I flew in to Albuquerque to see all the red and golden leaves. This trip has been a dream.

This weekend @SouthwestAir gave me the opportunity to travel to a new destination with 40,000 Rapid Rewards Points and a Companion Pass to bring my sister. From California to New Mexico, I sort of feel like I ended up on another planet.

I photographed Alice just after I told her how beautiful she is, and how adorable her child was. My photo essay from my trip to Peru with @contiki has been published, and I‚Äôd love it if you checked it out (link in my bio.) It turns out it‚Äôs very easy to bring smiles and happiness to strangers, by simply being kind.

I traveled to @peru with one mission: be kind, talk with the locals, and make people smile. It was an extremely rewarding trip for me, and I was able to write about my experience with @contiki. Check out the link in my profile to see more portraits like this one, just before and after I told her how beautiful she was.

Sebastian has been making handwoven textiles since he was just a little boy. On Taquile Island, it is only the men who knit for trade, and are known for some of the highest quality handicrafts in Peru.

The people of Peru are so kind and often shy, but are gorgeous and come alive in front of the camera. Drosa taught us about the technique of making and dying Peru‚Äôs famous alpaca wool.

The best part about hiking the Inca Trail was I had to opportunity to see Machu Picchu twice on this trip. Once at the end of our long day, and then again for sunrise the next morning. This, as a photographer, is a dream come true. Watching the light and weather change around this stunning monument - I got to see the best I could hope for. After our long day of hiking I wanted nothing more than to just sit and admire it. We found a place, tucked away from some of the other tourists, and just stared in awe. The next morning was gray, but as the sun broke through, and the clouds lifted, it was truly better than any postcard I had ever seen. No matter how many pictures you see of a place, to be standing there in front of it for yourself, always exceeds your expectations.

Hiking the Inca Trail in @peru, through the Sun Gate and down into Machu Picchu will for sure be the highlight of this trip. The views were breathtaking, and well worth every step of the 9 mile (14.5km) day hike. It was challenging, but when we wanted to rest we did so amongst the ruins or along the edge of beautifully lush valleys and mountains. After completing the hike it actually made me interested in someday doing the entire 4 day trek, I really felt like I wanted more! There might still be some views left on my story if you‚Äôre interested, because I was pretty much left in awe and without the words to describe it.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/569c624236e7dcd6d138870a470b878f/5BEB48F0/t51.2885-15/e35/22159035_1432556286863807_5086260706131574784_n.jpg
The place I‚Äôve been most looking forward to visit while in @peru were the floating islands of Uros. One of these things you kind of have to see to believe, or even understand really. An entire civilization of people have made a home, life, and culture on top of islands made of woven reeds. They welcomed us with smiling faces, actual open arms, and taught us about their history and way of life. My week working with @contiki is quickly coming to an end, but the best is yet to come. This trip has really made an impression on me, and I‚Äôm so thankful to be able to have this experience.

Every day Peru shows me something new, and I am left in awe. The people of Taquile Island, deep in Lake Titicaca, are a society based on collectivism, with a population of about 2,000 people. Everything they eat, wear, and make is produced on this island. They do not export their beautiful hand-crafted goods, instead they are sustained by tourism and sell only to people who come to the island. I feel so lucky to have visited such a unique and incredible place. A woman and her daughter cooked us one of the best lunches I‚Äôve experienced, all with fresh and organic ingredients from their home. Moments and places like this are why I travel.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/91cc0901cc1835f2865aa92ef8ad5711/5BD6CCA5/t51.2885-15/e35/22157798_123543301642924_2720501442849800192_n.jpg
As we left the bigger cities, the conversations with people became a bit more difficult for me. I‚Äôve put the little bit of Spanish I know to work, but found that often sharing smiles is just as effective as conversation. Here I tried chatting with this little girl, her mother understood me, and kept insisting she answer me directly when I asked her how she was doing, and what her name was. Instead she was a bit shy, as I‚Äôve learned a lot of Peruvians can be - but as soon as I picked up my camera she was hamming it up and striking poses like a pro. My connection to Wi-Fi and service has been spotty, but if you want to follow along with my adventures working with @contiki this week, check out my stories for a better glimpse. I have just been in awe of this beautiful country and incredible people. #TheTravelProject #contiki

I walked by Caesar playing this instrument, which I learned is called a zampo√±a, and asked to take his picture. As soon as I did, Augustin came over and started singing and jamming along. Both are friends in Lima, and said they‚Äôve never had pictures of themselves playing but always wanted some (for Facebook üòÇ). They were so thrilled when I told them I‚Äôd send them the photos later, I was so thrilled they were so friendly and talented.

With all that is going on in the world, I‚Äôm really happy to be working with @contiki this week as I step out of my comfort zone a bit and try to make some people smile. In an act to spread a little kindness I‚Äôll be traveling around the beautiful country of Peru, talking to the locals and paying them compliments. Like Manuel here - although he was already smiling ear-to-ear when I sat down to lunch, we broke through the language barrier to find out where each other are from, make each other laugh, and enjoy simply connecting. The world needs more people like him. #TheTravelProject

The only way I want to shoot a big camp photo of my festival friends and family is in #ChromalogicalOrder. This year Color Day really was my favorite day. It's just an excuse for everyone in #OurHouseCamp to spend the day together, running around and being silly just for fun and photos. It makes us smile, and as we're roaming the grounds in rainbow order, it makes the people around us smile too. This year's photo was shot on top of the Sun Temple at the @globaleclipsegathering.

When the sky line is sprinkled with hot air balloons every morning...
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/50ec1c9b5e9724e9337280faae40b470/5BE7A8F0/t51.2885-15/e35/21107545_301278640281617_1425195136656080896_n.jpg
I was so excited to see what the light was going to look like. I had my camera in hand, I knew I had to shoot something, but I didn't want to view the eclipse through the lens either. I assured myself if I didn't get a good photo, it would be fine. So I shot, and didn't check the images until later. The minutes just before and after totality were nothing like I expected. I think I thought it would look like sunset - pinks and orange, soft light. It wasn't that at all. Like everyone has said, photos don't show an accurate picture. It was almost like someone just had a dimmer switch on the light. It was that harsh, overhead morning light...but just darker. All of my photos look like they're just 2 stops underexposed. The colors were muted. We still had shadows, but they sort of mushed into the non-shadows. Once totality happened, day turned to night. I got cold, but didn't want to put on my jacket. I wanted to feel the temperature change, I embraced the goosebumps. I jumped up, spun around in circles, looking at the horizon around more than up. Simultaneously the longest and shortest 2 minutes ever.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3c9555b6ef35d389e90326f5669951e9/5BEA57C0/t51.2885-15/e35/21040895_499893977018106_2682039070116282368_n.jpg
I'm not very good with words. In fact, I think the only thing I was able to speak during those two minutes of totality was, "oh my gosh." So it's hard for me to describe what watching the total eclipse was like. Let's just say I've got my mind set on seeing it again in South America in 2020, and then again in 2024... I understand these eclipse chasers, it's such an incredible sight, once is just not enough. I feel different after being able to watch such a thing. The black moon in the sky has never looked so huge as it did in that moment I first peeled off my eclipse glasses. I'm thankful I was able to capture this photo - witnessing this total eclipse in the middle of an open prairie with thousands of people from all around the world, and some of my very best friends and family, is something I can't ever forget. And whoever had "Here Comes The Sun" queued up to play just after totality, I love you.

My annual week-long festival retreat looked a little different this year, but was no less magical. I replaced a dry lake bed with one full of water and floaties; and instead of a huge burn over the weekend there was a total solar eclipse on a Monday. The same silly friends who make #OurHouseCamp feel like home for a week in the desert, travelled a bit more North and settled in the new landscape just the same. I can't compare the two, but for the first time in 10 years I am missing Burning Man. Good thing the @globaleclipsegathering this year was a unique dreamy experience that will never and could never happen again. For that, I am thankful for such an incredible experience. #oregonstarfest #moonrave

I had the pleasure of working with this wonderful shoe company as they collaborated with three local businesses based out of downtown Los Angeles. Check out the @allbirds shoes inspired by the products of @pfcandleco, and head to their profile to see all of the photography I did with them and the two other downtown companies. They have a pop-up shop located in @grandcentralmarketla through the end of the month, featuring their fantastic shoes and unique products from each of the locals. Go down and try on a pair, you won't want to take them off. üòâ I loved being a part of this L.A. showcase - great products and the best people.
