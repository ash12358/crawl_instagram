Caseville and Sand Point really showed their best sides this week, but people are what make a place, and the people we hung out with made all of this even more magical. Thank you everyone for an amazing week. An extra shout-out to almost four-year-old Peyton for having the best answers to questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite color?‚Äù (‚Äúthe rainbow‚Äù) and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite dessert?‚Äù (‚ÄúAll of them‚Äù)

Boyfriend is reading Mio min Mio in Swedish (he has become really proficient in Swedish!) and I‚Äôm planning a course or challenge if you will, designed to give you tools to be less angry and frustrated. I‚Äôll post the challenges here on Instagram so you don‚Äôt have to do anything if you want to participate. If you want to read the intro, you can find it on my Medium, Twitter or LinkedIn accounts.

This is @sershammar, and the tattoo on his arm says ‚ÄúWhen my day comes I hope to be able to say that I have loved and been loved, all the rest is really just background music even if quite loud at times‚Äù. It‚Äôs a quote from Hans who was very close to Samuel, who in turn is one of my closest friends. Although me and Hans never met, I feel like he is close to me too, because he was so close to someone I‚Äôm so close to. It‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶ collateral closeness, in a good way.

@pirretmi found the best replacement for traditional deodorant: a powder with activated charcoal and fragrance keeps me both dry and fresh in a way that not even the best traditional deodorants can. And: no stains on your clothes.

Me and @lewicque in one of those free fall rides. I imagine this was 1999 or 2000. I‚Äôm about 23, and I think it‚Äôs so cool to be in control that although I was terrified of the height, and of the sudden fall, I went on it so many times that I managed to control that feeling. It also looks as if I forgot to live in the process, if you compare the facial expressions of me and my friend. The funny thing is that the calm I was seeking didn‚Äôt lay in controlling everything, including my feelings. The calm is on the other side of letting go.

Last Friday, I had the pleasure of meeting and listening to a lot of very inspiring people. One of them was Marcel Hof (brother of Wim Hof of the Wim Hof method) who talked about the benefits of ice baths. It‚Äôs fascinating what your body can do if you just don‚Äôt fight it. It inspired me to go back to taking ice cold showers again. Like many worthwhile things, it‚Äôs not comfortable at all, but the reward is awesome: the energy and clarity once you reach the point of the cold not bothering you is amazing. Thank you Leith Society Amsterdam for arranging an amazing day. I‚Äôm already looking forward to the next one!

Last weekend, I participated in an ayahuasca ceremony. It was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life so far. It took insights that I know to be true when I am reminded of them and integrated them, making them present all the time. . . The insight this time was the quote that @rupaulofficial finishes every episode of Drag Race with: "If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love somebody else?" Another way of expressing it is "live in love or live in fear". . . . Fear has always stood in the way of being my true self. Fear of being wrong. Fear of failing. Fear of not being perfect. Fear of being judged. . . . There's still fear in me, but there's much less of it. The space it previously occupied is now filled with love. Love for humanity, animals, nature, the universe. In that, I've also found love for myself, because we are one. People are so beautiful to me. You are beautiful to me.

Most of the hydrogen in the universe has existed since the Big Bang. 60% of the atoms in your body are hydrogen. If you want to calculate it by mass, it‚Äôs ~7%. What is the rest, then? Carbon, oxygen, iron, calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen. All those elements were made in stars. Phosphorus, for example, is believed to be made in massive stars, more than eight solar masses. In order for you to exist, many stars had to go supernova to create the stardust you are made of. To me, that‚Äôs a truly awesome fact.

We skinned up two mountains (about 900 meters the first day, 1300 meters the second), went down untouched powder, had drinks in the hot tub in our cabin, ate great food and pretty much had an amazing ski trip. If you like skiing, put Stranda and @uteguiden on your list. If you‚Äôre interested in the lodge with the hot tub on the patio, overlooking Stranda valley, PM me for link.

I‚Äôm so proud! @bogministeriet just published our 200th episode since the start six years ago. I‚Äôm so grateful for my fellow ministers and co-founders @olssonrobin, @waldekrantz, @martenand, @tomboy_sthlm, @setdesignerjohan and our new (and amazing) ministers @antonrenstrom and @filip_pachucki! I‚Äôve learned so much from you guys: to be more honest, more compassionate, less ashamed of who I am, how powerful it can be to be honest, not to take myself too seriously and above all: how true friends help you grow. It was scary at first, but we grew more courageous together and I think we‚Äôre doing something really good both for us and for the gay community. I‚Äôm also grateful for our listeners, who keep us going every week. Let‚Äôs hope there will be another six years and 200 episodes (at least!) üíï

One of the best things with working with @hyperisland: the feedback sessions. Feedback is a free, yet very generous gift. It‚Äôs amazing to get to know myself better by hearing how my behavior affects others and learn new things about myself, and it‚Äôs equally great to verbalize to my colleagues how incredibly competent they are. . . Today I learned that the work I put into stopping pretending to be perfect, and into showing my human side shows in my work.

Today‚Äôs lesson in Swedish and Swedish culture for @pirretmi, is ‚ÄúFucking √Öm√•l‚Äù (‚ÄúShow Me Love‚Äù), one of my favorite LGBT movies of all time.

Here‚Äôs an idea for 2018: get some sort of container, preferably clear so you can see it filling up. Place it somewhere visible in a room you spend time in every day, so that you have it as a visual reminder (I put ours in our living room). Get a writing pad or calling cards, and a pen, and place them close to the container so it‚Äôs easy to write things down. and every time something nice happens in your life, write it down on a piece of paper and put it in the container. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, open the container (and maybe a bottle of bubbles if you want to indulge) and read the notes and be reminded about all the nice things that happened to you. This way, you maximize your chances to end the year on a positive note, and it‚Äôs a very easy way to practice gratefulness.

Part of the damage school did to my generation ‚Äî and still does to to kids ‚Äî is to teach us ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make mistakes‚Äù. In the school universe, there‚Äôs only one right answer and many wrong. As long as you are a good parrot and repeat what you‚Äôve heard or read and give the one right answer, you‚Äôll get good grades. I learned English from video games, books and movies, and still to this day I sometimes pronounce English words in a funny way because I‚Äôve never said them out loud before. This quote makes me happy because it shifted my mindset to pride of my knowledge of the word, rather than shame about my pronunciation of it.

Last day on Iceland was spent driving the Golden Circle. The best stop was also the last, at the Secret Lagoon. It‚Äôs the oldest thermal baths on Iceland and less touristy (and way, way cheaper) than the Blue Lagoon. You don‚Äôt even have to bring swimsuit and towel, you can rent both and still get away cheaper than the basic entrance to Blue Lagoon. They have the warm water and the the cold beer, you‚Äôll have to bring the friends yourself ‚Äî and mine completed the trifecta. . . . #gaytravel #gaysofinstagram #iceland #secretlagoon #thermalbaths

Hallgr√≠mskirkja is perhaps the most beautiful church I‚Äôve seen. Where more conventional churches are designed to make you feel small, humble, inferior and/or guilty (Il Duomo in Milan does all this and more), Hallgr√≠mskirkja made me feel light, happy and peaceful. I don‚Äôt think any of the Christian churches I‚Äôve been in have ever made me want to stay in the way this unconventional church did. It‚Äôs well worth a visit if you come to Reykjav√≠k. . . . #hallgrimskirkja #reykjavik #iceland #gaytravel #gaysofinstagram

Today, we took a road trip on the south parts of Iceland. The landscape is beautiful, and not unlike that of Hawaii (but with less snow, as @pirretmi so keenly observed). This photo was taken in Hj√∂rleifsh√∂fdi Cave, which we opted for instead of the wrecked plane that now is forever nicknamed ‚Äúthe Justin Bieber plane‚Äù . . . #gaytravel #gaysofinstagram #iceland #hj√∂rleifsh√∂f√∞i

Yesterday, I had a two hour chat with @bjornfalkevik about men, middle age, feelings, technology, being human and a lot more. This is a quote he has on the door of his office and I think it's very relevant today. You can find the link to our talk on Facebook.

A fantastic perk of being self-employed and working with the right people: tonight I got to see the cast of #bastubaletten ‚Äî now I have to see the whole series about men from Tornedalen talking about their lives and learning to dance. It seems like a very genuine cast. Look it up if you, like me, have missed it. And I got to see northern lights on one of the most intense nights of the year. #thankful

We have a tradition, to buy a Christmas ornament every time we travel to a new place. Every time we dress the Christmas tree, we're reminded of memories from our trips. To me, it's also a reminder of how many things I have to be grateful for. On the top of that list is my partner in both the memories and the tree dressing: @pirretmi.

Truism. I feel like our society is obsessed with career and knowing your goal and planning your future, to a degree where we lose serendipity. We're not getting out of this journey alive anyway, and focusing too much on trivial goals and material things make us blind to the beauty of the journey.

This is one of my happiest places and times right now: evening time, in the old and dingy but very comfortable chair @pirretmi bought at a yard sale in the US, with low light coming from the fantastic and kitschy flamingo lamp I got for my 40th from friends who obviously know me better than I do (hence the fantastic gift that I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted, and now am very fond of). The world outside is about to settle for the night, and I‚Äôm listening to music while learning so much about myself and, though that, about the world while writing my book. I feel like when I was ten and every subject in school seemed amazing because I learned so much, except that I‚Äôm 40 and have found that wonder and philosophical hunger that adulthood somewhere between 10 and 39 subdued to a faint whisper. There is not enough money or things in the world that I would give this up for. This will be replaced once I‚Äôm ready to move on, and I will find a happy place in something else, but until then I am going to enjoy this. . . . #gaysofinstagram #writersofinstagram #philosophy #happyplace #introvertsofinstagram

@bergnein was a project on @kickstarter, but Berghain sent lawyers to obstruct (without legal ground) and Kickstarter folded.

How do you play these things in 2017? I have no CD or DVD player anywhere, except for in my Xbox One and I don‚Äôt think it can rip a CD to MP3. . I haven‚Äôt heard this album since 1997, when I listened to it a lot. It‚Äôs not available through streaming, service I had to order it from a second-hand store in Germany. I hope that listening to it triggers more memories from the year I turned 20, since my book is a conversation with that person. . . . #gaysofinstagram #writersofinstagram #eurogames

Eating cream of mushroom soup with blue cheese and freshly baked bread in front of the stove, and going for a walk around Svaneholms Slott were two of the cherries on top of the delicious sundae this weekend was.

I got this pen from @gunderhaegg for my 40th birthday, and simple as it may be, it makes me happy every day that I use it. It‚Äôs colorful, so it‚Äôs easy to spot if I misplace it, and few people have a pen like this so it also becomes harder to take by mistake. It‚Äôs really nice to write with, and I‚Äôve been writing a lot by hand (many studies point to improved memorizing when you write by hand compared to writing on a computer). It‚Äôs amazing how much joy you can get out of a pen. Thanks Gustaf!

#tbt to the exactly eight years ago, in @stockholmpride Park in Tantolunden in Stockholm. I went bungee jumping for the second time that year and decided to jump buck naked (save for the harness) to see if it became scarier. (It didn‚Äôt. Bungee jumping is so frightening that there‚Äôs no room for other feelings, like shame or self-consciousness) . . . #gaysofinstagram #bungeejump #pride #stockholmpride #nakedbungeejump

Top: poison frog Bottom left: my Kambo stick. It‚Äôs a wooden stick with dried poison from the frog, used in traditional medicine by indigenous people in Peru and Brazil. Bottom right: the markings after having a shaman administer kambo to me. . . The Phyllomedusa Bicolor is a frog common in the upper region of the Amazon. It secretes a poison through its skin that makes most predators avoid it. The poison is gathered (without harming the frog) and used as traditional medicine. It has some very interesting effects, both physically and psychologically: for me, it is very centering, calming and either pain-reducing or muscle relaxing as it helps with back problems. You apply it by burning small holes in the skin, then scraping off the poison from the stick and applying it to the skin where the top layer is burned off. It‚Äôs completely legal, the medical industry is very interested in it (although synthesizing it is not possible yet) and if you are interested I recommend finding a practitioner. After having had it administered by a shaman twice, I got my own stick to administer it to myself. It‚Äôs a bold (or crazy) move depending on who you ask, but I wanted to explore the effects of multiple sessions. So far: 9/10, will do it again. . . . #kambo #phyllomedusabicolor #traditionalmedicine #shamanism #meditation

Walking in the city center during @stockholmpride is like walking among rainbows üåà.

Auschwitz is a monument to the unspeakable evil all of us are capable of. Image 1: An attempt to summarize the importance of Auschwitz-Birkenau in a sentence. There are 23 versions of this plaque at the monument in 23 different languages. . Image 2: One of the barracks at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest camp. Prisoners slept six to a bunk, the newest slept on the ground under the bunks. There were no washing facilities, which led to conditions we cannot fathom. . Image 3: The wall at Auschwitz where thousands of men and women were shot for existing. . Image 4: I doubt the Nazis intended these signs to be ironic, yet seeing them today, knowing what happened here, they almost seem like an installation. . Image 5: Two sets of electric barbwires, guards with guns and floodlights made sure that escaping was nigh impossible. . Image 6: view from one of the barracks at Auschwitz. The contrast of the beautiful weather, the green grass and the blue sky seen from the inside of these buildings made the stories told by the guide even more bleak and sickening. . Image 7: cans that contained pellets of Zyklon B, the gas that was used to murder millions of innocent people. . Image 8: A hole in the roof in the basement where Zyklon B was first used. This is where they dropped the gas pellets. Zyklon B boils (turns to gas) at 26 degrees Celsius, and the death could take from 5 to 30 minutes depending on the temperature outside. . Image 9: the rails and gate at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When the trains stopped, many men, women and children had only 380 more meters to walk to their deaths in the gas chambers. . Image 10: contemporary idiocy. The level of stupidity, arrogance, selfishness and general ass-hattery required to scribble your name on the wall of barracks where thousands of people suffered and lost their lives is as stupid as the Capos were evil. . . . #auschwitz #holocaust #neverforget #auschwitzbirkenau #genocide

Eradicating LGBT history: We‚Äôre on our way to visit Auschwitz, and I‚Äôm reminded of my visit to Dachau, where the memorial erected in 1968 shows all the emblems that prisoners wore. All except three: the black triangle of ‚Äúanti-socials‚Äù, the green of criminals and the pink triangle of homosexuals. Still, to this day, they refuse to amend it. Also worth remembering: gays who were ‚Äúrescued‚Äù never received restitution, they were often jailed for being gay and didn‚Äôt receive an apology from Germany until 2002. . . #gaytravel #lgbthistory #holocaust #dachau #pinktriangle

#postrunselfie - I've had a love/hate relationship with my beard ever since my barber told me to save it for a while so he can style it to match the bald fade he does for me. Then I learned that you shouldn't use soap or shampoo in your beard more than once a week, and that beard oil makes a huge difference and now there's more love and less hate in our relationship. Now I just can't wait for the rest of it to turn silver. . . . #scruffygay #instagay #silverfox

Project "Getting rid of all keys" has reached my bike. The u-lock from @hellolattis seems like a good option. The shackle is a bit short, but then I'm comparing it to my former one from Abus. I'm not sure how easy it is to break this u-lock, and wouldn't trust it outdoors overnight, but for day commutes it works great. Also: it's solar powered so you don't have to worry about the battery dying. . . . #gadgets #gaytech #bikegear #bikelock #keylesslife

Cyborg upgrade: hearing. I don't really like in-ear headphones, but the Here One from @hereplusme are really intriguing. Apart from being headphones and hands-free for your phone, they also have controls for the sound around you. Our biological ears are good enough, not perfect ‚Äî for example if you want to listen behind you, your ears aren't optimal. These allow you to choose which direction to enhance, to increase or decrease the volume from the world around you and give you an equalizer for the ambient sounds. An upgrade to your hearing, if they deliver what they promise. . . . #human2point0 #augmentedhuman #augmentedhearing #cyborg #gadgets #gaytech #upgradedself

The Easter weekend was a treat with fantastic company, a blue tit so tired from struggling to free itself from a net that it didn't resist being picked up, kids wanting me to "be a dinosaur" and building forts, puppies half border collie half golden retriever and what I'm sure must have been the entrance to the upside down.

It's a strange feeling to walk down Drottninggatan today. A lot of people, but everyone is quiet, subdued. If it weren't for the background noise from buildings and distant cars, I would have wondered if I had lost my hearing. The somber quietness combined with the amounts of flowers and messages along the street ‚Ä¶ in the darkness of this event, those things give me hope. People mourn, but refuse to be scared off the streets. Complete strangers unite in building a temporary monument of flowers to the injured and the dead. Messages written in Swedish, English, Arabic and other languages, most of them with the same message: love trumps hate in the long run. . . . #openstockholm #april72017

Temporary cyborg downgrade: I had to remove one of the anchors. The top image is of the original ends to the anchors ‚Äì a small metal sphere with a groove where you attach the loop that holds the #northsense. The problem with this is that it's not a good attachment while you're healing. It's easy to get an inflammation which makes the area around it swell, and then the whole anchor can be swallowed. The pros at @calmbodymodification exchanged the balls for flat top screws, which helped a little. Unfortunately, not enough. So today I had to remove one of the anchors (the other is healing perfectly) and now I have to wait for the wound to heal completely before attempting again. If you are going to do this, get flat top screws with as long a threaded part as you can for healing. That allows your skin to swell if it becomes inflamed without swallowing the anchor. The flat top in this case was the biggest Calm had in stock (5 mm). If you can get a bigger (8 mm) I recommend that.

Freaky Friday. She's the Man. Hot Chick. This movie. This movie trope of swapping bodies can be fun, but it's also oh so heteronormative and Men-Are-From-Mars, Women-From-Venus-y. Oh no, a the quiet girl all of a sudden acts like a loud BOY! . . Here's a idea for improvement: next time, let a gay, but closeted, boy swap bodies with the cheerleader. Then the boy-now-in-girl's-body goes on to fulfill his dream of sleeping with the whole football team, while the girl gets to live out all her teenage thirstiness without being judged a slut. In the end, they swap back and are just happy with the experience. Including Chuck, the quarterback, who got pegged by the boy-in-a-girl's-body and realized that you don't have to be gay to enjoy something up your butt. Hmm. I think I'm going to write the novel. . . . #instagay #gaymovies #gaysofinstagram #movietropes

As a kid, I never understood why the grown-ups in Dallas and Falcon Crest (the tv series for all you youngsters out there) came home and poured themselves a whisky ‚Äîor maybe it was bourbon, but it was an amber colored spirit anyway. I just found it weird. Then I became an adult and realized that there's nobody adultier around anymore, and started having shitty days and now I understand JR and the others. (PS. Don't call Betty Ford and arrange a spot for me, I'm not doing this every day, but with 45 as president and general human stupidity, that time might yet come) . . . #gaysofinstagram #instagay #shittydaybourbon

New mailboxes, and new name signs for the mailbox. Since the mailbox is so discreet, we chose a sufficiently flamboyant color for the signs. This is actually the first time we have both our names on the mailbox, the old one only had a number. . . . #instagay #gaysofinstagram

The "smart" paddock from @nokelocks is a great idea; unfortunately the execution leaves this lock far from being eligible for #buyqualitycryonce ‚Äî in fact it's close to useless. The reason is the shackle, which is way too thick to fit where you use regular padlocks (such as the lockers at one of the biggest gym chains in Sweden). It is also not long enough to fit in places like our storage unit in the basement, which also is pretty standard for Sweden. . . . Another problem is that the app requires a connection if you haven't used it in a long while (which could be the case with storage units, for example). So if you have it on a storage unit where there is no cellular reception, you'll spend more time trying to fix this than you save on a lifetime of not having to use a key to the padlock. . . . #gadgets #gadgetreview #padlock #smarthomes #noke

Ghost in the Shell: 6/10 . Yesterday, we saw #ghostintheshell. I had high expectations, and it turned out to be a decent action movie. This is also the problem: it has potential to be one of the best movies this decade, but all the substance in the story is lost and substituted with special effects. I'd give it a 6/10 rating and wouldn't watch it again (unlike, say, The Matrix which I saw seven times in theaters). Go see it, but curb your enthusiasm so you don't get disappointed.

Got the carry-on from @g_rotogether (via @kickstarter). The design of the wheels takes up less space from the actual luggage while making the bag easier to pull on most surfaces. The handle is extra long, and the weight is supposed to be balanced (as opposed to your average bag where all the weight falls forward, on the handle). It also comes with a tracking module and a battery for charging your electronics (both optional). I'm looking forward to trying this, now I need to plan a trip.

Today we got to try some news from @absolutvodka: Absolut Mixt, Absolut Oak, Absolut Extrakt and Absolut Lime. My favorites are Absolut Extrakt which is tastes of cardamom and makes a perfect snaps for the Swedish Christmas table, and Oak which has a very distinct oak barrel tone and supposedly makes for an awesome Moscow Mule.

Tonight I saw the Tom of Finland movie (starring @hogner as Kake) and I really recommend seeing it. It's as good as Milk, and will be one of the iconic movies every gay has to see.

The Hover Passport in the case (the two L shaped brackets are the batteries) and in folded mode (see earlier post to see it in action). . . It's very light and compact, the whole case including batteries weighs less than 590 grams (1.3 lbs) and easily fits into my backpack. . . Launching the drone takes about 60 seconds: get it out, attach the battery, boot it up and connect to its wifi, start the app and you're ready to go. . . The wifi thing is a little of a bummer, because it adds several taps, but it was the right choice as it offers a longer range than Bluetooth. . . #hovercamera #gadgets #drone #gadgetreview #gaytech

#tbt to almost a year ago, when boyfriend and I had the privilege to get a private tour of Three Ring Ranch on Hawaii, led by Anne Goody who is phenomenal at communicating with animals. . . She taught us how to say hello to all kinds of animals, we got to witness how animals ranging from horses and a blonde zebra to monkeys and parrots completely accepted her as the alpha female (and therefore also accepted us since we were in her company). . .

Things I miss from üáØüáµ: Number one on this list is the best way to do number two. The washlets are very common in Japan, whether it's in the hotel or at the airport. They're toilets with a built in bidet, so instead of the barbaric use of toilet paper there's a nozzle that cleans your butt (or vagina, should you have one) with a spray of water. They have heated seats, and the fancier models also have a blow dryer. The fanciest models have a fan inside the bowl that gets rid of the smell (!), and can play sounds to cover your toilet noises should you require. After two weeks of this very civilized way of cleaning yourself after pooping, I feel insulted and violated (in a bad way) every time I have to use toilet paper and sit on cold toilet seats. Toto, one of the major manufacturers of the washlets, has a European branch and make this washlet for the European market. The deluxe model also cleans itself with UV light (the nozzle is always self-cleaning). To add insult to poop-smeared butt, they don't have any distributors in Sweden, so if I want one I have to import it from Germany or Estonia. That just makes me that much more determined to put "bathroom with a washlet" as one of my life goals. . . . #japan #toilet #toiletpaper #washlet #üí© #barbariantraditions

I don't typically like westerns, but decided to watch The Magnificent Seven on the flight home from Tokyo ‚Äî I'd already seen a bunch of the movies @flysas offers on their new entertainment system on our way over to Japan‚Äî mostly because I saw someone watching it and realized @prattprattpratt is in it. I was rewarded not only with a really good movie and the usual cute and charming Chris Pratt, but also the most shagable cast in history. Had I needed a freebie list, Chris Pratt would have been on it right up there with Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast in this movie could make up he rest: Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Peter Saarsgard, Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Marcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, Luke Grimes, Matt Bomer and Cam Gigandet. Even if westerns isn't your cup of tea, I recommend watching this. 8/10, would watch again! The question is: can you come up with a movie with a better eye-candy/entertainment ratio?

Food in üáØüáµ: you never know where there might be üê∑ in the food. I think this is an unfortunate mislabeling on @ana.japan's part, but it is very common to use pork in all kinds of courses. If you're an omnivore, this is not much of a problem, but if you like me try to eat less red meat and never eat pork, it is sometimes hard to find options. Sometimes pork is not even stated as an ingredient, like in the curry with rice and fried chicken (the curry contained pork). Other times you're expected to understand it, like in gyoza, the delicious little dumplings which as a rule always contain pork. Japanese seems like a beautiful, poetic language, but that also means that a lot gets lost in translation and most English menus only have a few keywords. The Japanese rely a lot on images of food (there's a whole industry making plastic versions of all sorts of food for restaurant displays) but it's hard to tell if a course contains meat when the meat is ground. There's always sushi, which in Japan goes from very good to excellent, but after a while you want some variation. Still, despite the fact that I don't eat pork, Japan is one of the best food countries I've visited. . . . #japan #travel #gaytravel #gaysofinstagram #foodlovers #ü•ò #lostintranslation #worldfood #travelinggays

One of my favorite things about Japan is that they put a lot of thought into function of things. Take the mirrors at our hotel for example, there's a heater behind part of it so that no matter how much or how hot you shower, there will always be a clear spot so you can use the mirror #functionoverform #japan

When it works, the @oakleyskiing Airwave with a HUD from @recon gives you a neat summary of your day. You get a map of where you've skied that day (including the names of the lifts and trails), your speed (my top speed was 48 km/h, which isn't bad for the tenth day ever on skis) as well as distance and total vertical drop. If you post photos on Instagram, they get added to the timeline automatically, making the Airwave a nice automatic diary of your day. The HUD has live maps when you're skiing in case you need it, and the remote control can be used for music and calls if you have your phone hooked up. Unfortunately, there are some issues that make me unsure whether I recommend them: the battery life of my unit is 2-3 hours (often closer to two than three) and the software has been glitching. I have had to tinker with them for three hours to get the data out and the support leaves a lot to be desired. However, that might be a problem with my individual unit. I'll know more next week.

I though this commuter backpack (for üö¥) from @chrome_industries would make #buyqualitycryonce, based on the awesome quality of their merino wool cobra hoodie, but unfortunately it won't make the list. There are some nifty features, like the straps allowing you to transport a u-lock (I don't want a mount on my @canyon_bikes bike) and the handles on the top that have magnets to keep them from separating. The problem is the lack of compartments inside, and the flimsy quality of one of the pockets. If you just have a few big items to transport, it's a great purchase, but if you have a lot of electronics and smaller stuff that you bring with you, this is not the backpack for you. I'm hoping the backpack from @peakdesign will be it, but I need to use it for a while to see how it wears before the verdict is in. #backpack #chromeindustries #peakdesign #commutinggear #bikinggear

Turns out you don't have to fake that "snow stuck to the window panes" - if it's sufficiently cold and snowy, and you have actual paned windows, you get that wintery look without having to do anything.

First impression of the open source, multifunctional crowdfunded wifi router from Turris Omnia: the finish is pretty cheap, partly because of the color (I'm sure the aluminum gray is the ugliest finish). In a time when both Google and Apple have routers that look, if not good then at least decent, this is a bit disappointing. It's lighter than I'd expect, but that's not necessarily bad. The fact that you have to open it because the antenna receptacles are not secured is worse. I'll return with a longer review once I've tried it a bit. #gadgets #crowdfunding #turrisomnia
