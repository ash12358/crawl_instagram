coffee at 4pm might be something I regret later, but when it tastes this good and I've had this kind of a day, I can't say I care all that much ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I‚Äôm sitting here, in what used to be (and may again becoming) my favorite coffee shop. It‚Äôs changed hands and has been thoroughly redecorated (walls taken down, everything painted, different furniture, etc.) which is always a bit jarring, but it‚Äôs starting to grow on me. I‚Äôve got one of their special ‚ÄúBarako‚Äù Lattes and a simple grilled cheese, and I‚Äôm digging into Chapter 10 for one of the last times. My goal was to finish this on the plane last night, but my body had a different idea and I slept so hard that the flight attendant had to shake me awake to put my tray table up before we landed. So here I am‚Ä¶ back home, in a new, familiar, different coffee shop that has good memories and lots of productivity associated with it. Let‚Äôs do this thing. #writingfromcoffee

sometimes you look back at what you wrote and wrinkle your nose in disgust but leave the paragraph there because you trust that after food and (more) coffee, your brain will be able to rework it into coherent words. the crappy first attempt is just breadcrumbs. speaking of breadcrumbs... thanks @homesf for providing a perfect place for me to focus today. #writingfromcoffee

dusting off this puzzle (literally) in one last attempt to finish the blue sections. taking an analytical approach this time: 1) make sure each piece is right-side up 2) organize the pieces into like shapes 3) scour the board for a tiny piece that fits that particular pictures-within-the picture segment 4) give up. cry. dust off the puzzle and start again üòúüòÖ wish me luck!

I grabbed a notebook off the shelf on my way out of the house this morning hoping it would help me get thoughts for this book out of my head & onto the page. I opened it up at the coffee shop and discovered notes for an feature article I wrote over 10 years ago. It was the perfect "you can do this... you're a good writer!!" reminder. ‚ù§Ô∏è . . . #timing #provision #writersblock #writingagain #firstlove #workingfromcoffee #writingadventure #almostanauthor #motivation

this was the "verse of the day" on my phone this evening, and it was exactly what I needed to hear. it's been a long, tiring week physically and emotionally, but God is faithful and true, and even when I don't understand His plan, I can rest in the fact that He has one. . my sweet 31-year-cousin Ashlee passed away unexpectedly a week ago today, leaving all of us stunned and saddened. due to flight delays and utter exhaustion, I wasn't able to attend her services this morning, but I spent a portion of this afternoon looking through pictures that people had shared of her throughout the years. we weren't incredibly close, but our proximity in age meant that we grew up playing together at all of the family functions. and despite our lack of communication through the years, she was always supportive and encouraging, no matter what I was going through. . this evening, I'm resting in God's peace and sovereignty, clinging tight to His promises, and holding friends and family closer in my mind. may I be as supportive to them and as interested in what they're involved in as Ashlee always was toward me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

we looked at the last words of Jesus on the cross tonight at our Good Friday service: "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." what is it that I need to surrender... to give up... to let God change in me so that He can work in and through me to impact the world? this isn't the first time I've heard that question, but it might be the first time I've had this answer: there isn't one thing I need to surrender. it's bigger than that. I need to be willing to trust God with me again. not with one particular part of my life, but with all of me. the issue has never been acknowledging my brokenness... I know that all too well. it's about being willing to accept the pain that comes with the growth; the hardship as well as the peace. it's about having faith in a plan that I can't see, and knowing that even if the plan doesn't make sense to me, God not only understands exactly where He's taking me, but has my best interest at heart, without fail. it's about putting my trust in HIM. not in those who claim to follow Him or mentors who let me down. not in those who promise goodness and a perfect life. not in those who profess to be Christians but who don't display Christ-like love and humility. I choose to place my trust in Jesus, who despite my unfaithfulness and inconsistency, loves me for who I am, as I am, with no exceptions. who chose to give up His life for me... making the ultimate sacrifice so that I in turn could be given a choice to follow Him. who continues to pursue me, no matter my interest in or mutual pursuit of Him. who loves me unconditionally, always, without exception. He is the one I choose to align myself with. He alone is worthy of my worship, and has proven worthy of my trust.

Jeremy and I happened across the most amazing gallery yesterday afternoon. I'm a sucker for sea glass, which is what pulled us in, but the store owner was truly a kindred spirit and kept us talking about dogs, the local area, his past, and art for over 2 hours. we finally left, having purchased the first piece of our art collection (the sweet little Sarafeena in the 2nd & 4th pictures), after falling in love with the whimsy and incredible detail of Marilyn Radzat's art.

someone was looking for a little extra love this morning on the way to work. the cuteness is too much to bear. #100happydays

tonight was everything that I needed to get through the day, and then some. it was countless hugs and tears and encouragement and laughs. it was heart-felt (and heart-warming) conversations with a trusted friend. it was sorting through the chaos and hurt and worry of the last few days and figuring out how to approach things with hope and assurance and kindness. it was realizing anew that sometimes I'm called to be the voice for the weak and to provide strength to the powerless, but that I desperately need to learn to balance that alongside taking care of myself. I know I've been saying it a lot lately, but I'm incredibly blessed to be a part of the @canvas_sf community. they make me a better person, a better Christian, a more compassionate human being. I'm ever-so-grateful for the part these people play in my life. I hope you all already know this, but if you need someone to talk to... someone to vent to... someone to give you a hug (virtual or irl)... no matter the circumstances, please reach out to me. you deserve to be heard, and I would be honored to listen. #100happydays

I spent today hanging out with my people at a venue formerly known as the Exploratorium. However weird it was to be at an event there and not be learning about physics or the playing around with giant spirographs, it was an awesome location for #CMXSummit. I shared ideas, got advice, absorbed wisdom from people who have built this industry I love so much, and got hugs from oh-so-many friends. In short, it was an awesome day üòä bonus... I got to enjoy this amazing view on my way to the bus stop üòâ #100happydays

a friend recently mentioned that half of my #100happydays posts are of #EmberDog, and I laughingly agreed. in fact, as I thought back through my pictures today, I'd wager that 90% include the beach, Ember, or @jermops (and often all 3 in one üòâ). I've been sticking closer to home lately... taking care of me, making sure I've got the energy to do the things I need to do, and taking it slow, which means fewer pictures of my beautiful city and the adventures that I find myself in while exploring. but I'm ok with that. because home is happy, and good, and fulfilling, and it's the simple things in life that keep me going right now. and that, after all, is what this project is about: being grateful for the little things, being aware of what's in front of me, and capturing what makes me smile. #100happydays

a good walk in the park to start and yummy treats afterward meant I was (mostly) forgiven for taking the #Emberdog to get his nails trimmed today. while I'm grateful for the recent rain, I was also grateful for the reprieve this afternoon which meant the 3 of us got outside for a while! #100happydays

I really should know this by now, but it's always amazing to me when the smallest things have the biggest impact on my outlook. A lunchtime walk on the beach... dinner with a good friend... a "mental health" day from work, spent at coffee shops and the library and Golden Gate Park. These seemingly small things help me put everything else in perspective, make it easier to sort through my thoughts, and give me the strength to keep moving forward. Here's to remembering to enjoy the small things more regularly as a way to keep the big things from raising their heads. #100happydays

It's been almost exactly 2 years since I saw @ingridmichaelson in concert for the first time and heard her sing "We're gonna be alright." It was an exceptionally rough season, and that song came at exactly the right time in my life. It was instantly (aka while at the concert) put into my Winter 2014 playlist. I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert again tonight, in the midst of 3 crazy weeks at work where burnout was starting to show its ugly head, and the song rang just as true tonight as it ever did. No matter what happens... no matter what the rest of the week brings... no matter the crazy that comes my way, we're gonna be alright. Thanks for an amazing concert, @ingridmichaelson, and thanks for your music. It makes a difference! üíñ #100happydays . . #myhappyplace #theseareafewofmyfavoritethings #thefillmore #livemusic #weregonnabealright

today is this little boy's birthday. it's hard to believe he's 9 years old, and even harder to believe I'm coming up on 8 years of having him in my life. he's a spunky one, and has gone from being a fun companion to a life saver and an ever-present defender over the years. I'm incredibly grateful for the part he plays in my life, despite his stubbornness and doggedness (see what I did there? üòâ). he puts up with a lot, and does it with tail wagging, always curious about the next adventure. happy birthday, little guy! thanks for letting me put giraffe ears on you üòâ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂ #100happydays #emberdog

that time once or twice a year when it hits 87' in SF and you've got a 20m wait for your bus, so you desperately go in search of shade, and then melt on the bus the entire way home, but that 5m of shade and beautiful view was an awesome distraction üò∞ #100happydays

I spent a good portion of my day stuck in bed with a silent migraine... basically all the joys of migraine side-effects (dizziness, stomach upset, light and sound sensitivity) and none of the head pain that usually tips me off to the migraine. I finally caught the hint and took migraine meds ~4pm, and angels have been singing ever since. winding up the day with a revised date night: cuddled on the couch, eating popcorn, watching The Little Prince, and snuggling with my guys. grateful for @jermops help and support throughout the day, and #emberpupsmcgee's snuggles, both of which made the day bearable. #100hhappydays

went for an evening walk along the beach tonight and was rewarded with a gorgeous sunset, meeting cool new people and cute pups, good conversations with my guy, and watching kids play in the dune and hardcore surfers excel at their hobby.

these last few days have been rough... I'll be honest. I haven't been able to put a finger on it, but things have just seemed "off" to a point where I wasn't even sure I wanted to fly tonight, and for those of you who know me, you know that's a big deal. somehow I found a tiny ounce of strength and pushed through apparently forgetting how to fly in the first two rotations, until I finally was back where I feel confident and coherent enough to not only fly well, but enjoy some time in the air with my guy as well. the feeling didn't last very long, but it was long enough to get me moving in the right direction again, however slowly. tomorrow is another day, and I'm choosing to face it with hope and confidence and the knowledge that I'm not alone. #100happydays {photo courtesy of @jermops, since I simply couldn't deal with angles and setups and creativity tonight. tomorrow will be better.}

Almost 2 years ago, I finished up the #100happydays challenge -- documenting 100 days with one photo a day -- things that made me smile or reminded me of how blessed I was despite the circumstances. The day's weren't perfect by any means, but having the one silver lining or reminder of why that day had been good changed my perspective drastically. I finally got around to making a book of those 100 days, and doing so inspired me to take on the challenge again. With the busyness and chaos of the last 2 years, I've found myself both taking and posting fewer photos, and I miss the creativity behind that process, as well as the (sometimes forced) worldview that came from looking for that one happy moment of every day. After all, when you've signed up to do something publicly, peer pressure is real üòâ Things are drastically different today than they were when I first started this project, and many of my blessings are easily seen every day, but the value of this perspective shift never gets old. As such, I'm starting "Take 2" of this challenge today. Anyone else want to join in? üòä Here's to the next 100 days, whatever they may bring. And here's to the completion of a project, which in turn inspired a new one, which is just as it should be.

I've got a lot on my plate to do today, but for right now, I've simply got good stuff on my plate: open face breakfast sandwiches, strawberries, a fun new book, and amazing coffee (plus brand new leggings to boot!). treating myself before digging in ‚ò∫Ô∏è

there are days when it still blows me away that I live in San Francisco -- my dream city. and then I'm quickly reminded that I spend far too much time inside instead of outside, enjoying the hidden nooks and crannies as well as the iconic landmarks. I think that's one of the things that bothers me the most about this Lyme infection & vertigo... I'm finally home for more than just a few days, with an opportunity to go places and see things, and yet I have neither the energy nor the stability to fully appreciate it. so I'm trying to focus on the good instead: * I'm home, and able to rest and recover in the comfort of my apartment, rather than having to struggle through this while on the road. * the weather is gorgeous this weekend, and the little that I have been able to venture out has been rewarded with beautiful views like this one and amazing community at church this morning. * I've needed to learn how to slow down for a long time now. this is my opportunity to be more patient with myself, and to remind myself that I'm not, nor do I need to be, a hero. * I have an amazing boyfriend who has been an absolute rock and a caretaker at a time when I'm having a hard time taking care of myself. * I'm using this time to reestablish my community in SF, and one interaction at a time, feeling like someday it will be more than just a place to be, but a place to truly live. so while I wait for my body to catch up with my mind, I'll count my blessings and take advantage of the times that I feel well enough to appreciate this marvelous city.

I'm still not a morning person, but I will admit that there's a certain beauty in being up before sunrise.
