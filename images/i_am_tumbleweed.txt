Because of chronic shortages brought about by short-sighted ideological policies over the past 15 years and an exclusive economic dependency on oil, Venezuela is desperately resorting to drastic measures to try to get the country back on track: First, reducing the work week to two days in the public sector to save energy. Now, forcing all public and private companies to loan their employees to the agricultural sector to combat starvation. https://www.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-reassign-private-public-workers-agriculture-014558981.html #Venezuela #crisis #starvation

In the early hours of May 19th, 2016, EgyptAir flight MS804 bound from Paris to Cairo crashed in the Mediterranean Sea between Turkey and Egypt, without leaving a trace or indicating to ATC that anything was wrong aboard the flight. The flight's black boxes have been retrieved and analyzed. On July 18th, authorities reported that CVR data did point to a fire on board the plane. This confirms forensic evidence of fire damage in the remains of the aircraft's forward section. FDR data had already indicated that smoke detectors had gone off in a toilet and in the avionics area beneath the cockpit. The incident (all possible causes are still under investigation) claimed 66 lives. My condolences to the victims' families and friends. #MS804 #EgyptAir

Two weeks, multiple shootings. More police shooting unarmed, subdued black men, and this time also a couple of what looks like revenge shootings of policemen. Though there are hundreds of millions of people living in constant denial in the country, there is a serious p... sorry, THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS in the USA regarding guns, racism and unnecessary police brutality. By the looks of it, it seems the situation is coming to a head and people are fighting back. - Multiple such shootings in just a couple of weeks (even counting just those that made it to the news) - Institutionalized racism, as seen by the fact that ~60% of the victims of these shootings are black (hence the crosses) - A lasting unhealthy obsession with guns and a complete lack of political will to do anything about it - Political correctness pulling the wool over people's eyes regarding all these debates, backfiring and making things even worse.

On the evening of July 15th, a faction of the Turkish Army announced they had seized power in Ankara, claiming that democracy and secularism in Turkey are under threat. The coup claimed close to 300 lives so far. This is not the first such coup, as the army has several times intervened to restore the key values of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's legacy. But this time, most of the army wasn't part of it. Hours after the announcement, the coup appeared to have failed, and 6,000+ people were arrested in the aftermath (though violence continued). http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36818401 Because of some suspicious points about the failed coup, some suspect this might be a fake organized by Erdoǧan himself to increase his stature. They also fear that, if this is true, it may lead the country into an outright dictatorship, an Islamist Neo-Ottoman state. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/turkey-coup-conspiracy-theory-erdogan-military-gift-from-god-soldiers-istanbul-a7140516.html #Turkey #Coup #July15

Le soir du 14 juillet 2016, une attaque sanglante frappa la Promenade des Anglais de Nice en plein feu d'artifice. Un camion, conduit par un homme armé, faucha la foule et fit plus de 80 morts et des dizaines de blessés. L'organisation Daesh a par la suite indiqué que le coupable agissait pour elle. Mais l'aigle niçoise reste forte et reprendra bien vite son envol! Toutes mes condoléances pour les victimes et leurs proches. ----- On July 14th, 2016, a bloody attack hit the main beachside avenue in Nice right during the national holiday fireworks. A truck, driven by an armed man, ran through the crowd, killing over 80 people and injuring dozens more. ISIS later stated that the perpetrator acted on behalf of the Islamist organization. But the Nice eagle will rise again and fly! My condolences to all the victims and their relatives / friends. #Nice #Attack #14juillet #July14

"America has 5% of the world’s population, but nearly 25% of its prisoners." Seen on The Economist's FB feed. So much for the Land of the Free... Whether it's because of simple binary good vs. evil thought, laziness on the part of the authorities or deliberate attempts to disenfranchise whole swathes of the population, the USA have gone against their own promise. Yes, against this promise, the US courts and prison system seems to be saying, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore." Contradictory, isn't it? #usa #prisonreform http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21672292-best-way-reduce-prison-population-two-cheers?fsrc=scn/fb/te/pe/ed/twocheers

On Saturday, during and right in the middle of a massive peace rally in Ankara, Turkey, two bombs exploded a few seconds and several meters apart in the middle of the crowd. There were close to 100 victims. My condolences to all the thousands of people affected, whether victims, friends or relatives. --- Ankara Turkiye'de cumartesi gunu gerceklestirilen baris mitinginde, kalabaligin ortasinda birbirinden az uzaklikta iki bomba patladildi.

Saudi Arabia, already known for several human rights abuses on a regular basis (which happen to be widely tolerated politically because - surprise, surprise! they've still got oil - has been named head of some UN human rights committee. All this on the backdrop of histrionic denial of anything wrong at the Kaaba stampede, five bodies of Yemeni immigrants decapitated and hung up to be seen near the border, and the execution of a mild dissident guilty of having a radical dad... #SaudiArabia #humanrights

Mere weeks ago, Chile suffered an 8-magnitude earthquake and a 4.5-m tsunami. Just this week-end, the country had 2 more 6-magnitude earthquakes. Remarkably, these caused only 15 deaths, but rendered thousands homeless and forced the evacuation of a million more. My heart goes out to the victims' families as well as to all those who lost their homes or had to evacuate. #chilequake Hace poquitas semanas, Chile tuvo un sismo de magnitud 8 y un tsunami de 4,50m. Este fin de semana tuvo dos sismos más, de magnitud 6. Por lo visto esos provocaron sólo 15 muertes, pero sí hizo que miles se volvieran sin hogar y provocó la evacuación de un millón de personas. Lo siento mucho por todas las familias de las víctimas, y por todos los que perdieron sus casas o tuvieron que evacuar. #sismochile

Hungary, 2015 - one picture of a boy on a beach moves the social media world into pressuring authorities to suddenly start doing something about a refugee crisis that was already well under way. Then, after one of its journalists being caught on tape shamelessly beating some of them, the Hungarian authorities started putting barbed wire along the (Schengen internal) border with Slovenia... #newsflags #refugeecrisis
