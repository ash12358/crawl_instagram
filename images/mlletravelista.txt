There isn’t a traveler (especially those of us who travel to eat) who doesn’t worship Anthony Bourdain: his live hard ways, his fearless embrace of new experiences, his unapologetic swagger...He took honesty to another level, and left us with so much inspiration; I hope he finds peace now. Do you have a fav Bourdain quote? I have so many! . “If I am an advocate for anything, it is to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else’s shoes or at least eat their food. It’s a plus for everybody.” . “I know what I want. I want it all. I want to try everything once.” . “As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you.” . “Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.” . #eatwelltraveloften #theroadlesstraveled #enjoytheride #livethelittlethings #legend #quotestoliveby

My very first job ever was an apprenticeship in a flower shop. We would strip thorns from roses and polish every leaf in an arrangement so every gift was perfect. I LOVED that job: making pretty things to make people feel loved. To this day, I sometimes fantasize about having a little flower shop, and yesterday I walked into this: How dreamy is #emilythompsonflowers? . . . #iloveny #made_in_ny #whatisawinnyc #seeyourcity #flowersforlunch #getguilded #flowerpower

Today marks the end of National #SmallBusinessWeek and today @magyarolas and I had our first of a season of art shows. We’re so grateful for and encouraged by everyone who had a kind word, or purchased our products. Photography is a really tough business. Behind every photo that we present are a few dozen that didn't make our cut. For every hour you see us at an art show, there are many, many more unseen hours working on our photographs and on our business. If you shopped with us, thank you for choosing us: thank you for choosing local artists, Jersey-proud and printed in the USA. Cheers to another season for @millieandjunebug! 🥂 . . . #entrepreneur #smallbiz #shoplocalnj #shopsmall #smallthanks #lovecapemay #sjshowus

Happy #nationalpuppyday from Team Zissou! We brought Zissou (née Delilah) home just barely two weeks ago. We adopted our darling corgi-beagle-lab from @matchdogrescue. Her mom was rescued from a high-kill shelter while pregnant, and the litter was born in a foster home in Dallas. We can’t thank Kerri and her team of volunteers enough for the loving work that they do for our four-legged friends! We hope Zissou will love her new Jersey Shore home.

2017 was full of personal challenges for me. As much as I had found my home next to @magyarolas, I felt lost and lots of self doubt in my new country. But it was equally a year of opportunities as it was a year of challenges, and now we're singing and laughing while skating on our own backyard pond! I'm so grateful for all the kindness that new friends have shown me, all my moments of weakness that taught me to be vulnerable and trust in the Universe (or at least my husband!) and for @millieandjunebug, now in three wonderful shops in Cape May! I can't wait to see what 2018 brings. Happy New Year! 🥂💖🍀

We are so lucky to call Cape May our home, surrounded by ocean sunrises and seafood dinners. But I've always been a city girl and have always been proud to call #Toronto, with all its ambition, diversity and vibrancy my hometown. An eight day visit just wasn't enough to experience all that had changed in the last five months I was away, but I fell in love with what I did taste. At the new @lapalmato restaurant (my new fav!): a veggie-forward menu rooted in Italian cuisine, doused in Californian style. And this room? #sodreamy We loved our #brunch so much we stayed till cocktail hour.

Having never been a camping kinda girl, I was a little skeptical about staying in a fale, Samoa's traditional open-air accommodations. Basically it's a roof, mattress and mosqito net (the wc is usually located a few steps away) on the beach. After my first night, I was hooked. During the day the fales are surprisingly breezy, at night the sound of ocean waves lull you to sleep, then you wake to sunrise on the beach. I'll definitely miss fales after all. #🇼🇸 #🏝 #Samoa #beautifulsamoa #traveldeeper #MLJBhoneymoon #fale

Headlines often seem so far away. When a tsunami generating waves of 14 metres (46 feet) high hit #Samoa in 2009, I hardly knew this region. Not so for my husband, who had spent six months here as a surfer dude back in the 90's. Twenty villages on the southern coast were destroyed and he could only hope that the people he called family were somehow safe. We went searching for them this week, and were heartbroken to hear that almost all of the families in his village had left Ti'avea to resettle elsewhere—including his. Only through some cosmic kindness, brilliant detective work, and overwhelming generosity from new friends did we manage to finally find his family (visit @magyarolas for a photo of the Browns). We've been listening to stories of survival and tragedy all over this island, and while the human scars still seem fresh, ruins all along the coastline like this one have already been reborn as nature's children. . #beautifulsamoa #traveldeeper #🇼🇸 #🏝#MLJBhoneymoon

Today we leave the stunning black lava rock beaches of Samoa's southern coast for Ti'avea in search of the family my husband lived with when he came here 20 years ago. The beaches here are amongst the most beautiful I've ever seen in the world; the water is certainly the warmest. It's like stepping into a lovely bath every time we take a dip. #🇼🇸 #🌴 #Samoa #beautifulsamoa  #beautifuldestinations #MLJBhoneymoon #traveldeeper

Since arriving in #Samoa, we've been in a semi-permanent state of wet—either from sweat, rain (mostly), or jumping into the ocean—so much so that I feel almost mermaid. The most gleeful wet experience yet though, was yesterday in Samoa's iconic #ToSua swimming hole. It's a unique land formation consisting of two giant holes joined via an ancient lava tube cave. We were in love with To Sua at first sight, even from the top, but after a thrilling 10 metre descent down the little wooden ladder, we couldn't bear to leave... #🇼🇸 #🏊🏻 #MLJBhoneymoon #beautifuldestinations #traveldeeper #takemeback #beautifulsamoa

🇫🇯🔜🇼🇸 After an all too brief and rainy time in Fiji, we're on our way to Samoa! This was snapped as we were flying somewhere over the Philippines. Samoa is a really special place in my husband's life story and I can't wait to discover it with him as my guide... #MLJBhoneymoon #upintheair #✈️ #chasinglight #beautifulmatters

A misty morning on the jade waters of Hạ Long Bay yesterday. The towering limestone pillars of this bay has gone through 500 million years of formation.

It was a tough call, choosing between the picturesque rice terraces of Sapa (think Pinterest photos of Vietnam) and the isolated valleys of Mai Châu. In the end, we opted for Mai Châu because the weather of Sapa would be less kind at this time of year, and the terraces likely more brown. Mai Châu did not disappoint and immediately became our favourite place in #Vietnam, especially for @magyarolas who has been roped into planting rice with the locals on more than one occasion. The stunning landscape, warm fresh air, and rural soundtrack have us reaching for excuses to delay our return to Hanoi... #🇻🇳 #🌱 #travelerinvietnam #gopro #traveldeeper #beautifuldestinations #MLJBhoneymoon

We indulged in a private transfer between Hội An and Huế today, which provided us the luxury of exploring and photographing the Marble Mountain, Hải Vân Pass, and Lăng Cô Beach at our leisure. My favourite part of the day though, was pausing for a lunch of savoury clams at this fishing village. The clouds were heavy, but the sky was bright, and we were soaking it all up on a large deck over the water. #🇻🇳 #🎣 #traveldeeper #travelerinvietnam #livethelittlethings #MLJBhoneymoon

This will do. After four days of monsoonal rains following us from Ninh Hòa to Hội An, we're happy for this cloudy day. Hội An Ancient Town has turned out to be our favourite place in Vietnam with its car-free zones, Venetian streets, and stunning Chinese architecture in Provençal colours. This is our first hotel on our honeymoon, and we admit it's a treat after almost four weeks of home stays and "strange and wonderful" lodgings. We haven't been on the grounds much with so much to explore, but yes it will do... #🇻🇳 #HoiAn #MLJBhoneymoon #travelerinvietnam #roomwithaview #infinitypool #🌴

This evening's #sunset on Đà Lạt, #Vietnam. Though we found respite here from Saigon's heat, we couldn't escape the crowds except when we were in the hills of our villa, some 1,500 metres above sea-level.

Ho Chi Minh is not the most populous city I've ever visited (Tokyo, Mumbai, Istanbul...have larger populations) but tonight I held my breath as we cruised past the Mekong Delta into Saigon. The maze of waterways and thick carpet of homes under the smoggy sunset was both intimidating and breathtaking at once. Happy Lunar New Year from Vietnam!

Almost two weeks in #Indonesia and I never took to the local brew. Sumatran #coffee is famous for being divisive: either you love it or you hate it and I was part of the later camp.

It rained all day so I skipped snorkelling which of course meant today would be the day my husband saw no less than three lion-fish in the water without me.

For the last three days, @magyarolas and I have been at Turtle Beach which is on an uninhabited island in Indonesia. Only two rangers are allowed on this island and anyone visiting must apply for a special permit to stay as guests of the rangers. It took a ferry and a private boat charter to get to; needless to say there is no wifi or phone service on the island, and we had electricity for only two hours each night, powered by a generator. We shared our ocean-front "yard" with dragons and bats and saw birds and butterflies like we've never seen anywhere else before. It was living in nature at its best, and the rangers were chivalrous, generous, excellent cooks, and taught us so much about turtles. Turtles come to this beach *every* night to lay eggs, which is statistically mind blowing. This baby was found during turtle patrol, suffering from crab bite wounds to her neck so my husband brought her back to camp for her protection. She was very weak but seemed happy when we tickled her belly. We named her Jerry before we slept, but in the morning, Jerry was dead. These little creatures fight so hard for a chance. You can help them by: (1) reducing reliance on single-use plastic as turtles confuse plastic in the ocean for food which kills them, and (2) supporting turtle conservancies like @haka_sumatra. In New Jersey, we love @wetlandsinstitute and @njmarinemammal. #🐢 #🇮🇩 #turtlepower #lifeaquatic #love #traveldeeper #yourshotphotographer #MLJBhoneymoon

We're in carb heaven here in Indonesia: rice for breakfast, noodles for lunch and dinner...but just now nothing beats local passion fruit and luscious mangosteen.

My husband randomly picked Medan, #Sumatra as the starting point of our honeymoon, but the recent discovery that my paternal grandfather 爷爷 was born here gave this visit the feeling of a pilgrimage. Though the jewellery shop he would've worked at as a young man is now long gone, it was spine tingling to imagine his life in the streets we wandered today. Did he find it as dusty and hot as I did? Did he like the complex flavours we fell in love with? I wish he was still here to tell us... #🇮🇩 #wanderlust #beautifuldestinations #traveldeeper #MLJBhoneymoon #indonesia_photography

Up close but not personal with the wild horses of #Assateague Island. Visitors are strongly discouraged from petting and/or feeding the irresistible horses. Folklore has it that these #🐴 are the descendants of survivors of a shipwreck 300 years ago on the Atlantic coast. #mywildliferefuge Thank you for the photo @magyarolas!

This time in Bangkok, I didn't even have 24 hours. But we woke up to this view of Wat Arun, and now a refreshing Earl Grey Fizz and a delicious Coconut Shake on the Chao Phraya River. Best of all, I had a chance to catch up with the dearest hearts in #Bangkok. See you again soon Thailand 🙏 We won't be able to stay away for long.

They don't ask and we don't tell. Anytime we've been able to rent a motorcycle without a motorcycle driver's permit, we've quietly taken a bike and gleefully torn down the streets, earlier in Myanmar and now in Chiang Rai. I'll be arriving at #FourSeasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle with motorcycle hair tomorrow, but I'm so happy introduce my favourite person to my favourite elephants. Can't wait to be back @FSTentedCamp!

Having eaten almost exclusively at roadside eateries since arriving in Myanmar, cocktails at the Governor's Residence, a 1920s-era teakwood mansion, was a real treat this balmy evening. For me, Dagon Bubbles: sparkling wine, Gold Mandalay Rum, Myanmar Floral Honey, Lime Juice, Ginger, and Red Chili—a fitting farewell to the Burmese flavours we can't get enough of!

Sunset in Yangon yesterday evening. Today is our last day in this complex country with so much more to discover and we don't want to leave, even though we still have Chiang Rai, Bangkok, and Dubai adventures ahead of us... #nofilter #smogfilter

Inle Lake is undeniably beautiful, so it is understandably a huge draw for tourists in Myanmar. We escaped by private boat to Sankar Lake yesterday and stumbled amongst ancient stupas, and spent today around Nyaung Shwe, challenging old men to checkers, cranking sugar cane juice with the ladies at a street stall, and even playing soccer with monks. It was one of our happiest days here yet.

Quintessential Myanmar: Hot air balloons floating over Bagan's temples at sunrise. I had imagined this sunrise so many times before arriving, but it was a multitude of other little moments that made my day in Bagan: catching a child-monk kick his sister in jest...a monk smoking a cigarette nonchalantly while strolling the dusty streets...unexpected peeks into Burmese lives.

We stumbled into Shan Kalay Kyun Village today, just led by curiosity and a path through verdant green fields. What we thought would be a cafe stop turned out to be a family affair, with broken English and lots of giggles over a table full of food. The family wouldn't let us pay for anything and insisted we return again. Just as we were leaving, we discovered that, like me, they are ethnically Chinese, which just goes to show that if you go way way way back, everyone is from the same place. #onthetable

They say the thing to do in Mandalay is to catch the sunrise on U Bein Bridge (the longest teak bridge in the world) so we made our way there this morning, before the sun even rose. We were rewarded by a milky lake and a soft pink sun, shy smiles and warm hospitality all around. It was an amazing introduction to Myanmar. #travelgram

Fifty Shades of Gray. There was a coastal flood warning for #JerseyShore today, and with good reason. I've never seen the ocean so angry. This fence was actually falling into the ocean because the beach was being washed away.

Earlier this week, I visited Scarborough Bluffs for the first time since I was a little girl. I marvelled at the glacial-blueness of the lake water and the massive size of the escarpment. The Bluffs rises to 300 ft at its highest point, which would be 60 of me standing on top of each other!

It's hard to imagine our grandparents were ever young, but here's proof. Love this vintage selfie of my dapper 公公 and beautiful 婆婆 on a date in Hong Kong, probably circa late-1940's. No filter, true black-and-white. Such a handsome couple.

Long before Instagram, and DSLR, and even Polaroid, there were black and white photos. My Granny used to tell me about her hand-painting my great-grandfather's black and whites at his photo shop in Shandong, China. Tonight's twilight cloud is for 婆婆 Madam Lau Yin Ha (whose name means swallow in twilight clouds), an emminently sensible and fiercely independent woman whose love of chocolate defined her to her last day. (~1922—May 31 2014).
