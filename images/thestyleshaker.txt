Black & white #wednesday I’m literally in sweatpants and a ratty tank finding my angles for another IG shot, but when I go all #blackandwhite with it, ohhhhh the drama, ohhhhh the intensity of it all! 🙃😮you’ll see it in full #color tomorrow. Still the same amount of #drama tho 🤷🏻‍♀️#makeunder #greenbeauty can be #glam I swear (sans sweats).

Ok, so I’m a few days into playing with my new squalane + vitamin c oil from @biossance & this rarely happens, but I’m already seeing a difference. Not sure whether it’s the mass quantities of sleep I’ve been getting, the non-stop 🍋 water drinking, the new face oil, or all of the above, but my skin is extra happy 😊 right now so I’ll take it & see what happens after two weeks!  #transformationtuesday #greenbeauty #selfie

🍋 🍋 🍋 Give your liver a break. It’s detoxing like a champ in there, and with all the toxins we’re exposed to these days (eh ‘hem, thanks Pride weekend), I guarantee it could use a little 💕 love right about now.  Plus, your skin will freaking LOVE it. Beauty and skincare is an inside-out job!! Here’s my super-complicated Lemon Water recipe: 〰️ 🍋 - a big squeeze of a lemon wedge 💧- my favorite ceramic mug filled with hot (Berkey-filtered) water 🍯- a little squeeze of local honey 😊- that’s all 〰️ #monday #motivation #lemon #water

“You never really know what’s going on underneath the surface.” 🌊 That applies as much to the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean, as it does to the human mind. ✨ Sometimes the surface can be misleading.

Side eye #tuesday Today was a blur. A good blur, but a blur nonetheless 🤦🏻‍♀️ After 30 days (not in a row, but I only missed two!) of #meditation , I’ve come to really love 💕 the time that I carve out to practice. It’s probably the best form, certainly one of the healthiest, of decompression after a long, hectic day. So a quick ‘hi’ and ‘bye’ today. This girl needs some quiet zen time. @headspace made me do it & now it’s become a way of life. #tuesdaythoughts

#tbt to that one time, both backlight lamps were working. It was a magical 🦄 day on set. I was elated, can’t you tell? 😐 More like I was just waiting for one of them to go out again. I have a thing with 💡, they go on and off all, the, time. Just me? Creepy? I digress. Happy NEW VIDEO  #thrusday !!! #greenbeauty #review 💚🙌

#wellnesswednesday takes a little left turn 👈 Today I heard, “you’re too nice,” from someone I work with, and it struck a chord. This person meant well. I took a minute, walked outside while that statement rolled around in my head, and then realized, that statement told me more about that person’s view of the world and had nothing to do with my own. 💕 It took me 30-plus years to get here, but I am here, I busted my 🍑 to be here, and there is no way I will dim my smile (yes, sometimes a smirk, but anyway) based on unsolicited feedback, well meaning or otherwise. 🦋 Yes, adaptogens and biohacks are cool. Crystals look pretty, and smoothie bowls are def fun to drool over, but if you want to be well AF, if you want inner #wellness , carve out some precious time to learn how to listen to yourself and believe in what you hear, because my love, that inner voice will take you exactly where you need to go (even if it may feel like you’ve detoured) and those unsolicited opinions will slide right off your back...you will see them for what they are. I’m still working on this part 😉 🌸 Do what YOU know in your heart is true. Listen to YOUR brilliant, quirky, gorgeous, ridiculous, unique self. Write your OWN story. 🌊 My unsolicited opinion? The world could use more smiles, more “nice,” and more respect. I’m not Pollyanna. I have my moments. I set my boundaries and believe I don’t have to be a bitch to do so. But kindness is important. It changes things. I don’t care if you’re at home on the couch playing on your phone, waiting in the TSA line, or sitting in a acronym-filled corporate meeting: Treat others as you want to be treated. Period. The world needs your smile, your smirk, your kindness, your genuine version of “nice.” 💕 Oh, and to anyone out there who doesn’t agree, I present you with one of my favorites: don’t mistake kindness for weakness. #justsayin 💚 I’ll leave that right there. 👸🏻-B **in other news, still loving my new lip balm 😘 #selfie with a story 😉

#wellnesswednesday Jade rollers, Keto diets, oxygen therapy, crystals, meditation, MCT oil, bulletproof coffee, [insert flavor-of-the-week wellness industry darling here]- 💚keeping up with it all is confusing AF no? 🤦🏻‍♀️. Sometimes I like to remind myself to just, freakin, breathe. I like to put a drop of this oil into my palms, rub ‘em together, and hold them up to my face for a giant inhale. It brings me back to, well, me. I dare ya: take 10 full breaths right now. See what happens. Report back 🤗💕#breathe #wellness #wednesday

I get it from my mom: the ability to find the good in any situation, the confidence to go for my dreams, no matter how weird they may be, my insistence on making “me time” a priority, my use of non-words and phrases like ‘dit-work’ and ‘gorpy,’ my love of cooking while blasting music and dancing in the kitchen, my obsession with learning, my need to question ev-er-y-thing, my backhand on the 🎾 court, my competitive side, my fashion sense, and my strength. This women is maaaaybe 5’2, she giggles and makes you feel like you can do anything (just ask all my friends that would call and ask to speak with her for a pep talk, yay high school), but don’t get it twisted, she is a force to be reckoned with. I’m proud to call her my mother every day, I’m proud to be her daughter and friend, and I’m glad I’ve got Judy on my team. #queenjudy Happy Mother’s Day mom. I hope I continue to make you proud. Love, Bee 🐝 ❤️ #happymothersday ps-Sorry Barrett, but the pic was way too cute to crop #80sbabies #howcuteismybigbrother

#saturday #samples session no. 1: Juice Beauty Last Looks Cream Blush in 02 Seashell 💕 First impression: never having been a big cream blush wearer I was a lil iffy at the get-go. A little goes a long way. Def best  after applying a little moisturizer/face oil. I happen to really like it as a light lip color too. Goes on lightly, blends in well. Is it a must-have for me? Probably more of a nice-to-have. It may very well come in handy when I’m on the go tho (last min touch ups). Always learning thx to these little tests #samplesesh #greenbeauty #guide

#wellnesswednesday I’ve always said I want to do 30 days of meditation, straight, and yet I never follow thru #life But I think I’ll take this Wellness Wednesday IG moment to kick off a month of #meditation and use my stories as my accountability buddy. Headspace account ✅ 10 min a day ✅ my nervous system could use a break, ya with me? What’s the point of all the serums and anti-aging treatments if mismanaged daily stress is counteracting the benefits? #amirite Nothing looks better than inner peace and being present, even if it’s just a moment here and there to build upon. So here’s to falling down 7 times and getting back up 8. 30 days, definitely do-able, especially with this @headspace app. Anyone else obsessed with his voice? 💕🙏🧘‍♀️#bonus

#Tuesday tip: I know I always say, “if the ingredient ‘fragrance’ is on the label, I won’t buy or use it.” But if I REALLY want to try the product, I’ll take an extra minute (literally, one minute) to email the company and ask them about it. Sometimes I get a fully transparent answer. Sometimes I hear crickets. Either way, it gets me to a shopping decision that I can live with and feel good about. Give it a shot. Ask “what’s inside” and see what they say. One day, everything will be fully transparent on the label so we won’t even have to bother with this, but for now, it never hurts to ask 😉 when it comes to @briogeo I ended up with an answer I liked btw 💚👌#greenbeauty #cleanbeauty

#skincare #saturday Most of the time, I never REAAALLY know whether my skincare is working or if I’m just making it up via wishful thinking, ya know? Sound familiar? SO, in an effort to know whether my latest oil or serum/hyped-up magic #greenbeauty potion is worth it, I’m testing these products out for 30 days. There will be before & after pics, there will be full downloads on what I like and what I honestly don’t, there will  be a #shelfie or two, and yes, there will be a video up on the @youtube channel. Comin soon to a cell phone near u (i.e. the one in your hand). First up: @kahinagivingbeauty Argan Oil. Behind-the-scenes in my stories 😉 💪💚

#tbt to that one time, on set, when I freaked out b/c I discovered little flecks of gold glitter in the #bbcream I was testing 🤦🏻‍♀️ ??!! When it comes to my #greenbeauty reviews, you know you’ll ALWAYS get 💯 honesty (and a few laughable freak-outs) from moi 😘 #callitlikeiseeit happy #Thursday friends 💕

#WellnessWednesday Outside: obsessed with this new #concealer (review live on the channel)! Inside: 🥒 for anti inflammatory stuffs, oh right,  they can also be put on top of the eye for depuffing 👀 OG spa day hack 💪 #wellness #wednesday
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c6c22d64fd046711d68e4bfd93a19290/5BDFDB6C/t51.2885-15/e35/31123788_235974213814858_7291172452040704000_n.jpg
#tiptuesday I am now a huge fan of lash #primers 😍. This one is my current fave (review is up on the channel if ya wanna know more). 💪Goes on electric blue, everything looks very 80s-tastic until you glide on your favorite #mascara and then, boom, volume! It’s crazy to see the difference. Lash health comes first (castor oil review on the channel all about that), but primers are just good to have around. 🍓🍋Inside-out tip: also good to have around? Frozen blueberries. 💙 These little guys are crazy high in antioxidants that help protect against cell damage. Get all sparkly 💫 on the inside (figuratively speaking of course, just sayin) and go for a little lash drama on the outside. Perfect combo. I always toss a few of these #blueberries into my #smoothies or #nicecream whateva works!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/aa0caf0a4be21f796230617ce7025a70/5BD92FF8/t51.2885-15/e35/30855391_441818826278088_6037388880347398144_n.jpg
And ps, you don’t even have to dig to find ‘em! 〰️ It’s a crazy cool time for clean beauty right now. The “big guys” are realizing you, aka best consumer ever, want to know what you’re putting onto your skin and subsequently, what you’re largest organ is absorbing. 💪 〰️ So keep asking, “what’s inside?” Keep asking, “can I use a cleaner version of this?” Don’t go crazy trying to do it all at once (it’s not possible #babysteps). And know that you may need to try things out (that’s why my channel exists; you can always ask me to try it out for ya 😉 ). 〰️ Above all, know that there are options people. And they are REALLY FREAKING GOOD! Clean beauty is only getting bigger. I can’t wait until it is the norm and no one has to ask what’s inside that “fragrance.” If you have no clue where to start, I have a free 101 guide on the site. I made it because I wish I had it when I got started on things. 〰️ Oh, and my clean beauty mascara dupe you ask? Well it’s a combo of this cool blue lash primer (new video for it up on a the channel) and the Honest Beauty mascara (it, for me, wins over even Lily Lolo). 🎉 The clean beauty revolution has arrived. I love a dramatic statement 👸🏻 almost as much as I love a high-drama brow…almost. 👀 #whatsinside #whatgoesongoesin #cleanbeauty #mondaymotivation #cleanbeautyrevolution

“Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.” - Confucius 🌸 another long one... Soooo, I had this friend back in the day that would go with me ev-er-y-where. We were two peas in a pod, besties, it was great at that time in our lives. One of the things I loved about her, was her ability to look at something, ANYTHING, and find beauty in it. This girl would find a zucchini 🥒 in the produce section, press “pause” on our 🛒 shopping, and come out with something like, “omg B, look at this one! Sooooo good right? I love zucchini don’t you?” I was like, “um, you mean the squash? Ieeeeeeummmm...sure.” 🤷🏻‍♀️ 〰️ She appreciated so many things that never even made it onto my radar. What was mundane to me, was pure magic to her. I didn’t know why our perspectives were so different, it didn’t really matter. All I knew was, I wanted to look at zucchini the way she did. 〰️ We grew apart, but her way of finding magic in the mundane, and seeing beauty where others may see the opposite, stuck with me. I try to catch myself at least once a day to see if I can find my own magic in the monotony. It’s not a constant thing, I mean, imagine what a trip to Whole Foods would be like 😕 8 hours later I’d walk out with like, five beautiful things in my basket because they’d have to close. But still, we can find beauty in everything, if we look for it. 〰️ This pic was taken on a walk with my mom a year or so ago. She’s speedy. The woman walks at a fast clip (she’d lap me if she didn’t want to chat). At the time, I was so dead set on keeping up with her that I was missing out on all the views. Views like this one 🤩So I stopped and caught this pic. Yea, sure, it’s a pile of palms, buuuuuut at second glance, it’s kinda gorge no? Nature nails that whole symmetry thing 🌏 Little beautiful moments. Your weekend can be filled with ‘em depending on how you look at things. Happy #friday Happy #weekend Happy finding beauty in unexpected places 🎉🦋

Ok, it’s official, everything bagel seasoning really does make everything taste better. Testing out this Adventure Bread...bread, made of seeds...verrrrry seedy (stating the obvious is one of my favorite pastimes). If you never try, you’ll never know! Whether it’s bread, BB cream, or that class you’ve been talking about taking for um, a year now and still haven’t. #justsayin #doit #thursday #breakfast vibes

Hey there👋...taking 10 seconds to breathe this #wednesday , u with me? 😉 #stressless I don’t know about you, but when I get into the flow of work or creating, I sometimes forget to take a full breath & my breathing gets ridiculously shallow. This is a reminder for myself, and you if you’re up to it, to just inhale and exhale. Basic, yet powerful. Breathing, it’s the OG of inside-out whole beauty hacks 🌸🌺🦋

Catch-all moment. I’ve recently gotten into making beautiful little messes around my place...tiny random vignettes. 10 years ago, this setup would have been put into teeny little containers and organized to a “t.” 😧Now, I’ve made the mess into a moment because, why not? It’s kinda nice to go with the flow these days, know what I mean? You can find #beauty everywhere if you’re looking for it 🌸 #tuesday #vibes

“She has a fire in her soul. Nothing can stop her.” - 🦄This is a long one… 5 years ago I moved to San Francisco & never looked back. I sold almost everything I had & went to live with my brother’s best friend so I could pursue my dreams. I was starting all over. I was living, not just existing, and it was scary. 〰️ I questioned the move daily, if not hourly. I wondered, were the “should-sayers” right? 〰️ - “You should never move somewhere without a job.” - “You shouldn’t go to California-too expensive and um, hello, earthquakes!” - “You shouldn’t leave your friends and clients in Dallas. What are you, insane?” - “You shouldn’t write a book. It’s SO hard, you’ll never make any money.” 〰️ 5 years later, as I look out this window from my incredible seat (your girl got her upgrade on) flying back to San Francisco, my 🏡 home now, all I can think is, “Wow, I did it. Thank you.” Turns out, those “shoulds” were someone else’s truths. They never became my own and they never will. 〰️ Mistakes were made. Tears were shed. Missteps were taken. Hearts were broken. On the other hand, love was found in the most unexpected of places, not all the tears were sad tears, and those missteps led me down paths I would have never dreamt possible. 〰️ I’m not writing this to take a walk down memory lane. I am doing it b/c my soul’s fire is lit 🔥 & I want to put it to good use. After all, Whole Beauty isn’t just about makeup & skincare. What’s happening inside your ♥️ and mind are just as important, probably more so. And THAT is where u come in, if u want to: 〰️ If your fire feels like it’s fading out & you need a little ❤️ or help, I’m here. We all are. The world needs you to follow what fuels your soul’s fire. It just does. Social media can make us all feel isolated, sure, but it can also bring us together. With this post, please know that you are not alone. We’re in this together 🙏❤️ #goforit On the other side of fear is a crazy beautiful life that has ups & downs still, but wow, this is living, REALLY living. Feed that that fire of yours, tend to it, & listen to your ❤️ not the “shoulds.” 🔥🦋 someone will look to u for a spark one day. #beready #mondaymotivation

It’s ☕️ this morning. It will most definitely be 🍸 tonight. It has been quite a week. I’m grateful for the ❤️ that surrounds and supports me. It helps me give ❤️ back & the world needs it. Knowing I have my YouTube channel as a platform to play and create on is the most incredible gift and another small way to put the good vibes out there. Thank you to my @youtube friends for creating such an amazing platform. Sending ❤️ to all of my neighbors #sanbruno at a time like this. #happyfriday #friday mood

Who runs the world? Yea, yep, u know who. Here’s to #internationalwomensday and here’s to the woman that set the bar in my life. The woman that raised me to speak up for what I believe in, to go for my dreams, to kill’em with kindness, and the woman who taught me how important it is to be able to support myself no matter what. I love you mom. ❤️Sending #love to all the strong women out there speaking up and supporting one another. And to those that do just the opposite: girl, bye. #womenempowerment

Sure, I woke up thinking today was Friday 🤦🏻‍♀️ And sure, for a min I was bummed. But then I realized, HELLO!! 💫 I get more time, another day, and that’s not a bad thing right? It always made me cringe on the inside when I’d ride in elevators in Dallas, and hear, “well at least it’s Wednesday right?” I don’t want to live a life of waiting for Friday’s and then feeling the Sunday “scaries” so, yea, I’m pretty happy it’s #thursday You? #lookingup #itsachoice ☕️ #selfie
