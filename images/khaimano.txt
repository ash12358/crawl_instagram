This is Dim Sum, my wife @evaemmanyna's cat. He is a temperamental little boy, cute as a button, but ready to attack at a moments notice. The only person he's super affectionate to is my wife, who like me, he misses dearly as she's been away for work overseas for the past month. In the meantime, we have a tumultuous relationship as we both wait for our love to come home. Goddamn, never thought I'd miss my wife this much.

This Friday at @thebeemy, my band Khaimano dust off the instruments to play alongside much better musicians than ourselves together with the full length 30 minute screening of @mien.ly's short film Selam 2.0 which I won best cinematography for. The big difference apart from additional scenes? COLOUR. The short version submitted for the BMW Shorties was the black and white version, inspired by pics I took whilst on set with my Zorki rangefinder. So I brought up the idea to Mien and she dug it. For the full colour version, which was how we originally envisioned it, we wanted strong, saturated colours, like cross processed film, but at the same time we wanted to kill certain colours, mainly green, the idea being nature has died in the future. Come n check it out this Friday, humans! #filmmaking #cinematography #indiefilm #indiemusic

Two totally different looks, same actress, same character. When I first started discussing the character of Khadijah for this movie with my wife @evaemmanyna who plays her I brought up the idea of having her in a hijab. Nothing about the character on paper suggests that she does, but I thought it would be an interesting take on her. I've always found the representation of Malay women here in Malaysian media more often than not incredibly one dimensional. If a girl wears a hijab, she's chaste and subservient. If she dresses sexily, she's a whore. And if she's a wife in a hijab for some reason she NEVER takes it off, even at home. I know women who wear hijabs who are the most open minded people I know, and others who dress sexily who are far from liberal. The outfit makes no difference. It's the person that counts.

Bought some expired Kodak Ektachrome a while back and thought I'd try it out when the sun was harsh. Since it's from the 80's even thought it's ISO 100 I exposed to ISO 50 and kept my fingers crossed when I sent it to be developed cross processed. The last time I shot some expired Ektachrome it came out leaning more towards the yellows and oranges but this time it went far off to the red in a pretty extreme way. If you swipe you can see a quick edit done on my phone to more 'proper' colours and another edit in black and white, just to see how it looks. Got two more rolls of these. Wondering what to shoot next. May bite the bullet and pay for proper E6 processing for those.

BTS photos from our little no budget movie 'Kickflip'. I originally was too lazy to develop these so I went to one of the developers I go to and asked how long the queue was for black and white to which I got the reply "very long" so I decided might as well. These photos were all taken on Fujifillm Acros 100, the same film stock we're trying to emulate in the movie with the Fujifilm XH-1. Of course, apart from being film the other major difference is the XH-1's base iso for video is 800. The rolls of Acros I had were all 100, and I've shot one roll at 100 on an Olympus mju ii and the other pushed to 400 on a Canon T70 with 28mm f2.8 Canon FD lens out of curiosity. Really curious to see the difference between these shots and the movie itself. But of course, film will always have that extra 'something'.

Since @kreateordie is now being printed overseas I ordered some samples to check out the printing and it's pretty dope! Rocking the 'Shoot First Get Permits Later' 512GB colour version of the design on the unisex tank top. I may have gone overboard by ordering the 2XL size but having it this big is nice and comfy, very light material. This tank top is available in multiple colours and there's a whole bunch of different designs.

After a few days with the Huawei P20 Pro I gotta admit - it's a damn good camera on a phone. The aperture mode (in this pic) is pretty on point for a 'fake' bokeh effect. The manual controls in the pro mode are a godsend. The monochrome mode is a beauty. A lot has been said about the AI in the camera that automatically detects the best settings for the type of pic your taking. For me it's ok for quick snaps and lots of regular users would appreciate it, but I'm not a big fan of the over-sharpening, bit too much for my liking. Shooting in raw is nicer to me but for quick snaps the AI is fine. I will admit I was a bit underwhelmed by the third lens, meant for telephoto. It doesn't work in pro mode raw as that sensor is smaller (I think) but in regular mode the over sharpening is too apparent unless you're under iso 400. Video mode also needs a lot of work - either put stabilisation in 4k and fix your bitrate or at the very least work with Filmic Pro to make their app compatible with this phone. As for the phone itself - to me, after a certain price point all phones work about the same these days, so no complaints. Nice big screen and colours and all that jazz. Battery life is nice too. If anyone is interested in a more in depth review on YouTube Holla back.

7 Years Ago. This photo was taken a day or two before principal photography began on Relationship Status. On that day I was shooting a commercial just before shooting the first scene of the movie. Whatever money I made from shooting this ad went into making the movie. . That week itself was a turning point in my life. Things changed. As I was just about to embark on a passion project movie about relationships in a digital age that would kick off the next phase of my career I watched, on this set, two relationships in my life dissolve. . I can‚Äôt fit into that Nine Inch Nails t shirt anymore. Or those jeans. That deck is now hanging on the wall and that red cap is lost. I no longer warrant getting paid as much as I did on that shoot. My career went upwards, then changed trajectory. . I‚Äôm not the same guy as the one in this picture anymore. He had major emotional issues and sometimes that shit was uncontrollable, but when it came to being behind or in front of the camera, he had more self belief. . I‚Äôm about to embark on another passion project. The stakes feel higher somehow.

Hey, @instagram! What‚Äôs the deal? I was literally just starting an account for my new business, and right after typing the name of my company my account got automatically suspended for violating your terms. What terms did I violate by putting my company‚Äôs name? Does it translate to something dirty in another language? And btw - where‚Äôs the link to contact you about a problem? Not an FAQ of helpful hints, an actual person to contact? Or are we supposed to just air our greviances publicly and tag you?

BE CAREFUL WHEN UPDATING LATEST WINDOWS 10 UPDATE So I updated the latest Windows 10 and discovered two disturbing things after rebooting: 1. A new drive popped up. It appears the new update rearranges the partitioning of the C drive in order to put the recovery files somewhere else or something. So a new drive with about 400+ MB suddenly appears, a large majority of which is full, and Windows keeps warning me that the drive is dangerously full. This can be pretty spooky if you have no idea why this drive suddenly popped up. But even scarier than that is my next point. 2. This new drive was assigned the same letter as my main work drive with over 1.3TB of work on it - and that drive completely disappeared. It wasn‚Äôt on my list of drives even when I checked disk management. Fortunately the fix for point 2 was relatively simple - unplug all the drives except for the C drive, boot up, shutdown, plug them back in and they‚Äôre all back with the missing drive assigned a new letter. As for point 1, the image above is the temporary fix by Microsoft to stop the low storage warnings from bugging you & apparently the next update will fix this current one. Thankfully, I knew enough basic computer mumbo jumbo to fix my drive but for a second that intense scare of losing 1.3TB of work almost gave me a heart attack. And since I can‚Äôt find a proper complaints department on Microsoft‚Äôs site (one ‚Äòsolution‚Äô offered in their forums was to write a physical letter to the main office - WTF), I figured I‚Äôd not only give others a heads up here on Instagram but also to air my greviances to @microsoft, beginning with the obvious: WHAT THE UNHOLY FUCK, MICROSOFT? Seriously, what the hell? I had faith in you. After I watched Apple‚Äôs High Sierra turn my 2011 iMac into the slowest, most useless machine in my house I always felt, ‚Äúhey, at least Microsoft doesn‚Äôt mess with their basic operating system architecture too much‚Äù. And then you pull THIS crap?! I am SO glad I wasn‚Äôt in the middle of a job. Seeing my entire work drive DISAPPEAR and be replaced with an almost full 400+ MB drive was scary as FUCK. Almost all of my work relies on PC‚Äôs, so please - DON‚ÄôT FUCK WITH MY WORK üò°

These aren‚Äôt photos. These are all the PowerPoint slides of my script breakdown for my upcoming no budget indie feature - 122 scenes broken down with shot examples, descriptions, camera instructions and anything else important for the scene. . I‚Äôve never done anything like this before but due to the nature of the movie I can‚Äôt really afford to not plan every single shot.

Wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this little curiosity of a camera - a Fujica Compact S rangefinder - but I just got my first test roll on it developed today and surprisingly, the photos didn‚Äôt come out too shabby.

Got to play with the Fujinon cinema lenses today at the launch. Using it makes you realise how a lens like this hasn‚Äôt existed for dslr users for so long - no lens ‚Äòbreathing‚Äô when you rack focus, focus stays put throughout the whole length of the zoom.

Please, please, please watch Men In Heels at KLPac. . This is not a plea to watch the videos I shot that are part of the play. Believe me, the stuff I shot is nothing compared to what happens on the stage.

Finished the DIY guitar for now. The cheap P90 pickup is surprisingly decent and powerful, making that single cool bridge pretty crappy in comparison. Future tweaks will be mostly on the wiring for a proper 3 way switch (currently 2 way) and probably change the bridge pickup to a humbucker. . #diy #diyguitar

Still have many aches and pains from the 3 weeks of heavy editing non-stop. Massages can only do so much. I honestly thought the first time I'd go to a orthopedic/sports surgeon would be for a skateboarding injury, not from sitting in front of a computer for 15 hours a day without breaks.

So this happened earlier. . In all honesty, it was really awesome just to be nominated but to also win is even more awesome, considering (a) we shot with a Sony A7s and FS100, (b) we used affordable vintage Canon FD lenses, (c) our only lights were two LED panels and (d) in an age where colour correction is taken to insane levels, we won for a black and white flick. . For me, it's a great validation for a way of working that some have (either directly or indirectly) snubbed for not being of a 'professional' level because of the equipment I use, and it's also great to see black and white cinematography is still appreciated. . Thanks @mien.ly and Bani for trusting me to capture your vision for y'all. Thanks to my crew, @pravthekumar and @aldouslu, for helping me capture it.

Lots of editing past and coming week has brought back a pretty severe bout of the ol' carpal tunnel syndrome type aches and nerve pains. I'm pretty sure most people use these wrist supports for more strenuous work but it does the job of alleviating some of the pain.

Black and white camera test with the Sony A7s. This is the in-camera black and white with some 16mm grain added.

Finished developing and scanning my first test roll of the Canon P rangefinder and I'm definitely happy with this purchase. I really enjoyed using it but the shots cement it. . The chrome 50mm f1.8 is sharp wide open and the rangefinder focusing is dead on. Almost all the shots are in focus where I want it to be and those that aren't are only ever so slightly off. .

Been doing some camera tests for an upcoming project, curious what others think regarding this - top and bottom pics are from two different cameras with different lenses, both shot at same iso and aperture and same black and white treatment. . Do you have a preference between top and bottom? Or it makes no difference? . This isn't from a pixel peep-ing perspective, sensor size, glass, etc. Just gut feeling based on two images. .

So a while back I swapped a roll of Cinestill with Bahir for one of his rolls of expired Ektachrome and tested it out on my Yashicaflex. I was hoping to E6 process it but it would take quite a while as the only shop I know that does it will only develop E6 once they have 8 rolls so I decided to just cross process it. . I'm quite glad I did. The results look great. Glad to see the Ektachrome hype is warranted.

First time attempting to repair or even of my film cameras - my Pentax spotmatic. Stuck mirrors are common when grabbing these. Luckily, fixing it isn't too much of an issue. . I need some lubricant for this bugger though, and not the WD-40 kind as that can dry up and clog things up over time. . I wonder where I put my skateboard bearing speed cream... . #filmphotography #filmcamera #pentaxspotmatic

Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the Fly-By. . I'm a huge fan of @greenroom136 bags and have a bunch of them, my favourite for work being the Metromonger which handles all my day-to-day video shooting needs. . But I wanted something simpler for when I just want to go out and snap some pics, a very basic no-frills sling bag like the old airline carry-on bags from the seventies. . So I reached out to Greenroom136 with an idea and a mock up of what I had in mind (2nd & 3rd picture) and they were down with trying out the idea and we came up with her first prototype (4th pic). After some hefty real world testing the bag was great except for a few minor adjustments and what you see in the first pic is the final version. It doesn't look that different than the original prototype but there's been a bunch of additions that perfected the bag and I can't wait to go out shooting with it. . The Fly-By is made of the same super strong water resistant Cordura as all the other Greenroom136 bags, fits their +kitpouch for your camera and slots for up to 13" Macbook Air size laptop, notepads, pens, an interior mesh pocket and 2 zip compartments on the outside. . I'm so stoked to see this design come to life and as opposed to a one-off, this bag will be going into production and I'm looking forward to seeing what the response will be. . The Fly-By will be in production soon but in the meantime, if this is something you'd be interested in let Greenroom136 know on their insta and FB. . Be like Maverick in Top Gun, kids. And request a Fly-By üòâ . #photography #camerabag #greenroom136 #RequestAGreenroomFlyBy

Purple lemsip and log sheets. Feeling better, but still a bit rough.
