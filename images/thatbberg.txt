So excited to read #10xmarketing by @CoSchedule's Garrett Moon!⠀ .⠀ While the weather allows, I'm trying to do a little work outside every day. Today I'm heading out to Schurz Park with a towel, my new book, a place to take notes, aaaand Ron Swanson (my laptop) in case I just miss wifi too damn much. 😝⠀ .⠀ Any other indoor cats try to take their indoor activities outside with them this time of year?

52 Fridays ago, I walked out of my day job for the last time. 🙌⠀ .⠀ I can't believe it's already been a year.⠀ .⠀ In a lot of ways, I'm in the same place. My business, for example, looks pretty much the same on the outside as it did a year ago. I offer mostly the same products and services (for now! 😉), the branding is the same (for now!), and I haven't created much new content so my site has a lot of the same stuff on it. And...gasp!...I'll even admit that over the past year my biz income hasn't grown much.⠀ .⠀ These might seem like bummers to admit, especially that last one. 😬⠀ .⠀ But for me? That looks like a year of me sticking to my boundaries.⠀ .⠀ A year of saying "no" to things in my business and a lot of growth opportunities to say "yes" to myself, my health, and my self-care.⠀ .⠀ Of becoming a completely new person in so many ways and learning about her.⠀ .⠀ That girl is still weak sometimes, but that's okay. And she's getting stronger every day. And JUST WAIT until you see what she's been up to. 🤗

Naps, treats, and fun: the secrets to success...NOT SARCASM! 🎤 drop. ⠀ .⠀ That's the #WorkBrighter mindset in a nutshell - you can't work if you don't play and rest too. 🌈⠀ .⠀ A lot of us think that rest, hobbies, and self-care are things that can wait until we're "successful." Whatever the hell that even means for you - a six-figure biz, a promotion at a 9-5, whatevs.⠀ .⠀ NOPE.⠀ .⠀ It takes more than hard work to do awesome shit.⠀ .⠀ Rest is work. Re-energizing is work. ALL OF IT is necessary. 😘⠀ .⠀ This is what we need to tell ourselves every damn day until it sticks..⠀ .⠀ Is this something you need to work on?⠀ .⠀ (I may be working on something you'll want to know about, so comment below! 😉)

"So this should be a great 4 months of imposter syndrome. 😳"⠀ .⠀ That's how I felt when I got the email that I'd been accepted to speak at @INBOUND this fall. 🙈⠀ .⠀ Obviously, at first, I was super excited, danced around to Jealous of My Boogie 3 times, and then called my parents and boyfriend. But then the rest of the week, I was miserable.⠀ .⠀ This is my favorite conference, and speaking there was more of a "bucket list" item to me, NEVER something that felt like it could happen so soon. I had mostly applied "for practice" for when I was more experienced and might actually be accepted, to say that I stepped out of my comfort zone and did it.⠀ .⠀ But then hey! Looks like I'm speaking! 🎉⠀ .⠀ So I'm getting comfortable with it, and booking a hotel for Boston. 😎⠀ .⠀ Do you ever "practice" or do dry runs of things that make you uncomfortable before going for the real thing too? 🤓

STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME A MORNING PERSON . My girl Mindy knows her shit. I'm all for self-improvement, productivity, and all that jazz, but *enough* with the mornings already. 😂 . From miracle mornings to morning pages to eating the frog, almost all expert productivity advice seems to be made for morning people. . But productivity is personal. 🦄 . I can improve my mornings all I want, I'm still not a morning person. I'll still always feel more motivated and productive at night than I do in the morning. So improving my mornings just improves my nights even more! . So I take slow, relaxed mornings and work into the night. It's a schedule I love, fell naturally into when I started working for myself full-time, and have no desire to change. 😍 . I've stopped fighting my own working habits. I've learned to listen to my body and brain. And this is what they say! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . What favorite routines do you have that go against traditional expert advice?

WHOAAAAA. 😬 . If we've been buds for awhile, you might remember me talking about how much I struggle with figuring out how all the things I've done over the years fit together. Productivity, tech, automation, content repurposing...what's the common thread that explain why those all appeal to me? . WELL. I figured it out, and I'm eyerolling because OF COURSE. . Hi, it’s my anxiety! 🙈 . At least partially. I’m pretty sure it’s behind my need for efficiency, love for automation, and all that jazz. Why did I never consider that in all this time I’ve been focusing on my physical and mental health, and realizing that both touch every part of my life EVERY day? . *Of course* it’s the freaking anxiety. 🙄 . I was so drawn to productivity and tech stuff because it lets me manage my weird brain better, take care of myself, and make this business stuff that’s so uncomfortable feel a little less overwhelming. . It all seems REALLY obvious now. I talk about my journey with health and self-care a lot more now, but I’ve never tied it to the other stuff I talk about in my blog posts and course, because I hadn’t seen the connection yet myself. . I can't wait to explore that more now. . Originally I’d felt weird doing something in my brand for Mental Health Awareness Month...it’s something I wanted to talk about (it feels weird NOT talking about something so consuming) but I wasn’t sure how it fit into my current ish. Now that the connection is building, I want to follow it.

Haaaaay #fridayintroductions hayyyyy 🎉 . I haven’t updated the feed in like a month and my rideshare is stuck in traffic, so now seemed as good a time as any. 🙃 . I’m Brittany aka Bberg, and I’m a content marketing strategist, writer, and accidental biz owner. . Here are a few things I’ve been working on lately: . - Working with a biz strategist to help me create a real biz plan. I went from side hustler with a collection of passion projects to “oh hi this is my only job now” without one, so now we’re figuring out how everything actually fits together and HOLY WOW is it excitiscary. 🤓 . - Building myself a work nook. In addition to not having a work plan, I haven’t had a work space. NYC apartments don’t make it easy, but after a winter of decluttering, organizing, and “does this bring me joy”-ing, I cleared out a whole corner for my business! 🏠 . - Managing my spoons. You might have heard of spoon theory, a way of thinking about energy management for people who deal with chronic or mental illness. I never liked or really understood it until recently, but after some conversations with friends who also go through this I’m ready to start recognizing my spoons more. 🥄 . What’s up with you? I’d love to know a few things goin on in your life that you’re proud of!

Did ya miss this face in all its ridiculousness? 😂⠀ .⠀ You know those stories where someone disappears from your social feed for awhile, and then they pop back up with a post about how important it is to go heads down and do the work and now they're back because they've like transformed their business and all that exciting stuff?⠀ .⠀ This is unfortunately not one of those posts.⠀ .⠀ Those times are important, obviously. Deep work is important, obviously. ⠀ .⠀ But sometimes, wrapping yourself up in a fuzzy blanket from topknot to toe and taking a break is as important to your business's long-term growth as actually working on your business is. (As long as you're taking the right kind of break, at least.)⠀ .⠀ I've known for a long time that the weakest link in my business isn't systems, isn't branding or visibility, but me...my physical and mental health and ability to just fucking deal with stuff day after day.⠀ .⠀ Nothing else can grow until I do.⠀ .⠀ It's not fun to talk about, not IRL and DEFINITELY not on Instagram. It's not exciting, not sexy, and honestly kind of humiliating. But we need to be talking about this more.⠀ .⠀ Your business can't grow faster than you do, and it felt like that's what was happening to me last year. I needed to slow down the growth there to give other parts of me time to catch up.⠀ .⠀ Don't feel like you constantly need to be growing your business to be growing your business, I guess is what I'm trying to say.⠀ .⠀ If you read this far down (OMG I'm sorry this got so long), you probably needed to hear this, so please hear me. Feel free to slow your roll whenever you need to, and don't neglect yourself for the sake of your business.

Domesticity ain’t no joke. Spent the whole day baking birthday cupcakes for my Superman, and now I think I deserve my own celebration. . Also got him into a matching onesie, which I’ve been trying to do for YEARS! 😍mwahaha

It’s this dinosaurs 30th! 🦖 and he’s gonna hate how much attention I drown him with 😍 . Prepping something special that he’ll love today! But also making a mess in the apartment that he’ll hate. . It all evens out.

Let's flashback to Thanksgiving break last year. . At this point, I was intentionally altering my sleep schedule so I could pull an all-nighter Thursday night, rewatching original episodes, and writing a BuzzFeed Community post of my predictions (don't judge me 🙈). . Only to get MASSIVELY disappointed by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. 😂 . Y'all know I'm normally "nothing but love" about my shows, but I have to be upfront with that. . And was it just me or was Rory kinda the worst freelancer ever? 🤔 Can we PLEASE talk about her business skills, PLEASE?

Earlier this week, I went to film a video but somehow my external mic was positioned weirdly and was just taking continuous burst pics of me 😂😂😂 . This is me realizing its not recording and trying to figure out what’s going on. . Note the increasingly confused face. 🙈 . Inspired by @jaimieemyers cause I’m always too worried about phone storage to keep the selfie rejects, but this has comedic value. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Do you spend time saying "hi" to new email subscribers? . A welcome sequence is the FIRST automation any business should set up when they're first getting started with email marketing. . It's simple, lets subscribers get to know you, and sets you up for long-term BFF-ness with your audience. 😍 .

What do Julie Andrews and The King and I have to do with email marketing? 🤔 . Well, go listen to the song "Getting to Know You." First of all, it's beautiful. That woman has the voice of a goddamn angel. 💁🏻 . But ALSO, that's the goal of your welcome sequence: "getting to know you...getting to like you...getting to hope you like me." Your welcome sequence is when you convince new prospects that you're they're cup of tea. (I'm dropping showtunes all over this caption and I'm LOVINGGGG it 😂) . So today, I'm talking about how to do that.

Hello you! There's nothing I love more than supplies that make me smile. 😀 . Instant mood boosters work, y'all. That's part of what makes personality quizzes so shareable. I mean, if a quiz told you that you were a unicorn, you wouldn't want to keep that to yourself, is all I'm saying. 💁🏻 . Want to be that INSTANT mood booster for new subscribers?

Let’s talk about BuzzFeed-style quizzes. People tend to have strong feelings about them – very love ‘em or hate ‘em. I love them but good. . Partially because a “Which Beyonce Are You?” quiz once told me I was I was the Beyonce from the Countdown video. That’s basically telling me I’m Beyonce AND Audrey Hepburn, and well, that’s just how you earn a fan for life. 😍 . But ALSO for other, more rational, “serious business” reasons. . They’re proven and popular tactics for growing your email list, with super brag-worthy results like increasing weekly list growth by 233% and bringing in 55.8 conversion rates (that's right, I can drop data just as well as I drop sitcom quotes 💁🏻) .

Productivity isn't black and white. There are lots of shades and colors. 🦄 . When I first started working on developing my productivity, I read the usual "work smarter" stuff. Lifehacker, 4-Hour Workweek, and all that jazz. And honestly? While I found the underlying information helpful, I HATED the way people talked about productivity, to the point that just the phrase "work smarter" still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 🙈 . They say there's one right way. One tactic. One system. One thing to work for everyone. One "productivity hack" (spoiler alert: productivity hacks are. not. a. thing.). But productivity and working styles are one of THE most personal parts of your business. It's NOT black and white, and true productivity lies in finding the right colors for YOU. 🌈 . . . . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

A blogger or business owner saying "I have nothing to post on social" is ALMOST as ridiculous (almost) as Ross telling Rachel, "We were on a break." 🙄🙄🙄 . (No, I will NEVER be over that, thank you very much) . In my latest video I talk about why that's ridiculous, and all the stuff you can share on social media with just a little bit of repurposing. 💁🏻 . . . . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

Throwback to a shot from the 3 hours I was #INBOUND last year. 🙈  Keep your marketing simple, keep it real. . Y'all have NO IDEA how much it hurts not to be there this week, but how big of a step it was for me to decide not to even *try* and head up north to make it happen. . For the past two years, I've gone to this conference when I was NOWHERE near healthy enough to go, and last year *never* even made it to the actual conference part because of it. I literally did not even see one minute of marketing advice. (Although I did see Leslie Odom Jr. sing The Room Where It Happens, so there's that! 💁🏻) . So this year, here's me, NOT in Boston, prioritizing my health over my career. 🙌 . That being said, you can bet your ass that I will be getting an early bird pass for next year AND applying to speak. 🤘

Real talk: entrepreneurs have a lot of ideas, and most of us try to go after too many of them at once. 🙄 . During months of health shittiness, I really had to "examine my fucking life," as Lady Fey puts it. I dropped things that weren't necessary...out of necessity...and things went on just fine. 💁🏻 . In fact, my sickest month was also my highest earning month. And my second sickest month was my second highest earning month. Because that's was when I was FORCED to really prioritize and only do the things with the biggest impact. . So let's do a quick Oprah exercise: re-examine your fucking life. . Pick one thing that can go, at least for now. Share it in the comments! 🙌 . . . . . . #workbrighter #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #abmhappylife #bloguettes #femaleentrepreneur #creativepreneur #creativeentrepreneur #infopreneur #lifeofafreelancer #blogbffs #livecolorfully #buildinganempire #womenentrepreneurs #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativeatheart #flashesofdelight #fempreneur #freelancelife #calledtobecreative

Fuck perfection, amirite? 🙌 . The amazing and inspiring @ashley.beaudin beaudin is in the midst of leading us through another @imperfectbosses movement. . If you've never seen this around online before, it's when we come together and throw ideals of perfection out the window and celebrate how great we are WITH our flaws. . In the name of imperfection, I'll admit that I didn't get my own confession ready in time, so I haven't shared it yet, but look out for it later this week. To take part on your own, share a confession tagging @imperfectbosses and #theimperfectboss on Insta. 😀 .

I get asked a lot what "working brighter" means. Well, it means that years ago, I was really into working smarter but found all of the existing productivity advice insanely boring, despite how good the underlying knowledge was. . It became my mission to infuse productivity with a little more color - starting with myself. "Work brighter" became my mantra, what I told myself instead of "work smarter," to remind myself that my business could be both productive and fun! . How do you work brighter instead of just smarter? . . . . . . #Workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz

How do you make your Facebook group members all 😍 😍 😍? . When I started my Facebook group, Unicorn Solopreneurs, in February, I knew that eventually, someway, there'd be a way for me to use it to spotlight others. . After all, it was part of my larger goal to become the Leslie Knope to my audience's Ann Perkins - and what better way to make them feel like a tropical starfish than to let them "star" in the group for a little?! . And so Unicorn Spotlights were born! . I'm still getting them started up, but have had so much fun working with group members to figure out the best way to love on them and give them the spotlight in a way that helps their biz best. . Sometimes it's a live training, sometimes it's a product collab, sometimes it's something I've never seen anyone else do before, but we're figuring it out. 😀 . . . . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

Do you ever take your work outside? . I'm VERRRRY much "an indoor cat," but, like, vitamin D. 😝  So this summer I've tried to find as many daily tasks as possible to do outside. The one thing that's becoming more routine lately is grabbing the planner I use as a journal to bring with me on my daily walks, and taking a few minutes to write in the park. 😀 . It's nice, but since a bird has pooped on me not once, but twice, during this new routine, I still classify myself as an indoor cat. 🙈 . . . . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

I've been really focusing on my physical and mental health this year, and with that obviously comes mindset work. . But ya know what? Most resources out there about mindset just don't seem to "fit" me. They leave me feeling less inspired and more pessimistic and feeling like I couldn't be successful without being "woo-woo." .

Quiz Time! Which Parks and Rec character embodies your biz personality? 🎉 . I mean, I'm OBVIOUSLY a Leslie - we both have great love for planners, candy, and Joe Biden 😍. . Plus because literally the reason I finally went and started a Facebook group was because I wanted to have a Galentine's Day party for my biz besties. Like, actually, I timed the launch around it. 🙄 . But I still like this Tom Haverford quote so I'm gonna post this Tom Haverford quote. 💁🏻 . . . . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

I'm an uber YouTube newbie. I don't have a fancy set yet, I just sit on my couch and push all evidence of my messy, tiny apartment to the corners of the frame. 💁🏻 . But one day, I want a super bright and comfy set with a chair as awesome as this stuffed high heel chair. 🎉 . Putting that into the world and setting the intention: my YouTube channel will feature one of the comfiest chairs you've ever seen someday. 😝 . (Not subscribed to my channel yet?

Do you make sure to spend time catching up on your favorite content, no matter how busy you are? . I know that when you're overwhelmed by all the content you have to create, you want to build a writing cave blanket fort, hide away, and ignore everything everyone else is out there creating. 🙈 . After all, isn't that all just triggers for comparison trap and distractions keeping you from getting your own content done? . And to that I say...a big ole NOPEEEEEE. 💁🏻 . When you have a lot to do, you need to get motivated and get inspired. And what's more inspiring than epic content! 🙌 . When you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, spending 30 minutes reading some of your favorite blogs or watching your favorite YouTube channels can make a world of a difference!. .

Confession: I decided to burn my systems to the ground 😳 . Yup, I spent years perfecting my organization systems, project management, and to-do list techniques, and then I trashed them all and lit the dumpster on fire. 🔥🔥🔥 . But I've been using the same apps and tools for so long, that there've been times where I've wondered if I'd like something else better that I just didn't have time to learn. . So when I took my business full-time, I figured now would be as good a time as any to change how I manage and organize my life, since it was all changing anyway. 😀 . Right now I'm in "testing mode," trying out new ways of using my planner and journal, testing out new apps (yup, I'm gonna try Asana again 😬), and seeing what works. . What are your fave must-have productivity tools - online or off? I'm going to be doing some experiments to vlog out! . . . . . . #workbrighter #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #abmhappylife #bloguettes #femaleentrepreneur #creativepreneur #creativeentrepreneur #infopreneur #lifeofafreelancer #blogbffs #livecolorfully #buildinganempire #womenentrepreneurs #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativeatheart #flashesofdelight #fempreneur #freelancelife #calledtobecreative

Unpopular opinion: I don't love the idea of batch creating content. 😬 . Why? Because it majorly slows your growth as a writer and creator. 📝 . Writing is a habit, and if you're trying to improve or even just maintain your current skills, you need to be creating *something* every damn day. Not once a week or once a month. . That doesn't need to mean actually publishing something every day, or even completing something every day. But sitting down, every day, for at least 15 minutes. That's what makes your content better - not writing all freaking day for just one day a month. 💁🏻 . If you batch your content, does it feel like your content evolves as much over time? . . . #workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativepreneur #beproductive #fempreneur #bloguettes #calledtobecreative

Y'all might know I'm all about creating content that's as productive as I am, and that means diversifying my income with affiliate marketing. 💰 . Earlier in the year when I couldn't create new content and products of my own, but wanted to be distracted by work, optimizing my existing content for affiliate income was a great, low-energy way to do *something* to help my business when I felt helpless. . As it turns out, affiliate marketing ended up becoming one of my main income streams that some months earns more than my writing services and products combined! 🤘 . Yesterday I got to attend the @shareasale #shareasalepopup for bloggers at #ASE17 and it was so great to be able to learn even more tips to implement! . (PS - Want to add more affiliate income to your own business? Everything I know, I learned from @michelleschro's Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing course! Check it out at bberg .me/msoam or the link in my bio, and if you buy it through that link, you receive a bonus ebook on automating affiliate marketing! 🤖) . . . . . . #Workbrighter #savvybusinessowner #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife #femaleentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #creativeentrepreneur #solopreneur #creativechics #blogbffs #thegramgang #buildingmyempire #womensupportingwomen #womeninbiz

Choosing the tech tools for your biz can be one of the most personal and complicated decisions you make in your business. 🤖 . Why someone chooses the apps they do, usually says more about them than the actual choice made. So this week on the blog, I published a different (and more awesome 🤘) kind of tech roundup. . Instead of a quick list of ALL the tools I use in my business, I picked the 7 platforms I'm MOST ride or die for, and wrote a massive, 3,000+ word roundup about WHY I chose these tools and why they're a perfect fit for my biz. .

Ready for some live action?! 🎬 . I'm going live on my Facebook page TODAY at 1:30pm EST with my first vlog about going full-time in my biz. . Over the past few months, I've been forced to get a lot more "go with the flow." Never knowing if you're going to be able to work today, or for how long, teaches you to get pretty good at building a flexible schedule that can adapt to last-minute changes well. .

This picture's from one year ago. . I was sitting in the hospital, not allowed to walk on my own, and was trying to finish a client blog post and work out the editorial calendar for Mention, while feeling guilty that I waited until evening to text my best friend for her birthday. . Yes, I was in the hospital multitasking and worrying about being a bad friend, ignoring the IVs in me. You could say my priorities were a leeeeettle fucked. . I hadn't put two and two together with dates, but I had a flare-up again the same week this year. . This time, as soon as it started, I shut everything down. Cancelled meetup RSVPs, postponed any and all calls, even created a plan B for my live Tool School workshop I'd been looking forward to for months. . I truly took time off to watch my symptoms, manage them, and take care of myself through a flare, without the hospital. In fact, I haven't had an ER visit in a little over 90 days, which is the longest healthy period I've had since this picture was taken. . I'm so fucking proud of myself. So insanely proud. I get that this topic may turn off some people, and I'm supposed to be more careful in how I show myself to my audience, and all that branding jazz, but this is too exciting to me to be bothered with strategic messaging. 💁🏻 . This is A BIG DEAL for me and I want to talk about it. I'm so far past where I was a year ago and feel true health right around the corner...I can't wait to get there!

As content creators, we don't always give our ideas enough credit. We publish something epic, spend a few days promoting it, and then it's onto the next one like Jay-Z. . Why? Your audience isn't done learning about that idea! They want more! So when a topic *works,* when they go gaga for it, keep repurposing the fuck out of it until they've learned everything they can. . . . #workbrighter #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmhappylife #bloguettes #femaleentrepreneur #creativepreneur #creativeentrepreneur #infopreneur #lifeofafreelancer #blogbffs #livecolorfully #buildinganempire #womenentrepreneurs #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativeatheart #flashesofdelight #fempreneur #freelancelife #calledtobecreative

I'd say this was the place I became a word nerd. 😍 . Growing up, I mainly read for fun during the summer. But let me tell you, I'd make up for the time lost during the school year. Especially on our Bethany Beach vacations, you couldn't tear me away from books, whether it was The Babysitter's Club in elementary school or Gossip Girl in high school (remember when GG was a BOOK?!). . I would sit on the beach and read all. damn. day. You couldn't talk me into building a sandcastle unless reading wasn't an option. And at night, I'd hide in the bathroom (since my sis would be sleeping in our shared room) and read until the middle of the night. . My parents would always underestimate how many books I could get through, so we'd never bring enough. So instead, every morning of the trip, when my Poppy went on his walk, he'd either bring me to this bookstore or come home with a gift for me: a book for the day. And yes, I'd finish it that day. 😍 . Although I don't know how much he'd love the book I bought there when I went back this week: As If! The Oral History of Clueless 💁🏻 . . . . . . #workbrighter #onewomanshop #immtribe #creativeempire #thesavvycommunity #femtrepreneur #tcctribe #socialboss #tnchustler #beingboss #abmhappylife #bloguettes #femaleentrepreneur #creativepreneur #creativeentrepreneur #infopreneur #lifeofafreelancer #blogbffs #livecolorfully #buildinganempire #womenentrepreneurs #womeninbiz #communityovercompetition #creativeatheart #flashesofdelight #fempreneur #freelancelife #calledtobecreative

Self-employment means when you realize at noon that you need a recovery day, you can actually take it 😬 . Climbing back into bed felt fucking EXHILERATING. Over the past few months, I've gotten so much better at realizing my limits, but the thing was, even if I recognized "okay, I'm unwell," I couldn't always actually DO something about it. There was a lot of sucking it up for the sake of meetings and deadlines and sprints. .

When I started my Facebook group earlier this year, I mapped out the kind of place I wanted it to be and I knew I wanted it to be different than all the groups where people just drop in for the promo thread once a week. . What I realized is that I wanted my community to feel like a 24/7 Galentine's day (literally, I have this written on a brainstorming sheet somewhere), and that if every woman in my audience is Ann Perkins, I want to be her Leslie Knope (also mapped out on a post-it). . And let me tell you, I don't think I've ever felt more Knope than when I'm celebrating other women's awesomeness! 🙌. . Not a member of the unicorn solopreneurs yet?

Okay. *takes deep breath, trembles slightly* . So, today is my last day at my full-time job. 💁🏻(how's THAT for #FridayIntroductions?!) . I've sat down so many times to write one of those announcements that people write when this happens, that's like this complicated mix of heartfelt, excited, and confident. . First of all, heartfelt-y serious isn't really me so it always ends up sounding overly cheesy. Second, I also have a lot of complicated feelings about this, and confidence usually isn't one of them. 😬 . But earlier this year, during yet another flare, I had to stop denying that this needed to happen. The past 2 years have more difficult and terrifying than I'm emotionally capable of even talking about anymore, let alone to keep living it. . I'm done - I'm ready to be a healthy person again. I need to be a healthy person again. . And I'm making the time and space to do whatever. it. fucking. takes. to get myself back to the person I used to be. . During my sicker months, I've seen my business go on just fine without me.  Those were actually some of its best months. It would like sit there patiently for me, all "whenever you're ready, I'm here," while everything else was going to shit. . I'm ready to put trust in that. . Over the next few weeks/months, I'm staying part-time-ish in my business instead of going pedal to the metal. Instead, I'm going full-time in my health. I'm trusting that I've built this thing strong enough to survive with me until I'm ready to work full-time again, and when I do, it will be with a *healthy* hustle (because I do believe that exists and hustle's not inherently bad). . Obviously, I do have a lot more to say, and a lot of people to thank who helped me get here and realize this, but I'll save it for a day less emotionally draining. 🙈 . Now I'm off for my last day, a doctor's appointment, and a nap! 😴

NEW BLOG POST HEYYYYY 🎉 🎉 🎉 . Yes, biz tech can be overwhelming, even more so when you’re not naturally a tech person. But are you making things harder than they need to be? . The big problem I see so many other entrepreneurs run into is this: They put tools before systems. . But wait – aren’t those the same thing? 🤔 . Not so, my friend! Not. so. And THAT’S where the trouble starts. . In my latest post, we're breaking down what exactly the difference is, and why that difference matters. 🙌  Follow the link in my bio to check it out!

Real talk: entrepreneurs have a lot of ideas, and most of us try to go after too many of them at once. 🙄 . During months of illness, I really had to "examine my fucking life," as Lady Fey puts it. I dropped things that weren't necessary...out of necessity...and things went on just fine. 💁🏻 . In fact, my sickest month was also my highest earning month. And my second sickest month was my second highest earning month. Because that's was when I was FORCED to really prioritize and only do the things with the biggest impact. . So let's do a quick Oprah exercise: re-examine your fucking life. Pick one thing that can go, at least for now.

Wanna start automating your biz right freaking now? Of course you do! 🤗 . Tonight, I’m running a free All About Automation live training in my free Facebook group for online solopreneurs. 🤖 . We’re gonna talk about why it rocks for online business, how to decide which tasks to automate, and specific to-dos you can start automating right now. Plus, you’ll be the first to hear the deets about Build Your Own VA’s brand new bonus, which is only available until Friday! Oh la la. 😍 . Want in? Just join at bberg.me/unicorns or through the link in my bio! 🙌

Wow, I can’t believe how quickly this is all coming together! 🤗 . If you missed my post yesterday, last week I decided to relaunch #BuildYourOwnVA starting, like, immediately. It was probably rash, but it just got to the point where I was way too excited to announce the new bonus. 🎁 . I thought I’d have to work myself half to death this weekend to make it happen, but things are going SO smoothly so far! Gotta love the “small but mighty” launch strategy. 💪 . Anyway, the promotion kicks off TOMORROW in my Facebook group, Unicorn Solopreneurs! I’ll be going live at 7pm EST with a quick “all about automation” live training followed by all the deets on this limited-time bonus. 🤖 . Join us by going to bberg .me/unicorns or through the link in my bio!

Sometimes, you’ve just gotta figure out a way to press “play.” . Last week, I decided I was tired of and overwhelmed by planning a bigass relaunch for Build Your Own VA. On Wednesday, I laid out the content plan. On Thursday, the first email went out to my list. . Why am I putting together a launch on such short notice even though I know I might end up with less new students in the process? . Because I know myself and my productivity habits. . This new bonus is going to be crazy valuable, and it needs to get into people’s hands. And if I hadn’t given myself a 24-hour deadline to get the first pieces of launch content out there, I never would have done it, and no one would get this help. . It got to the point where I didn’t want to wait until my list size reached a new milestone or I followed someone else’s launch sequence to a T. I’m doing students a disservice by continuing to sit on this (and yes, that feels cocky to say), so a launch next week it is! . Stay tuned to learn more about the new bonus. If you want to make sure you hear the details as soon as it’s available, join my Facebook group through the link in my bio or at http://bberg.me/unicorns!

The females are strong as hell 💪 . Getting my Kimmy on for today's #FridayIntroductions! Cause you know how I'm spending my night. 💁🏻 .

Have you defined your brand voice? You may be *completely shocked* to know that humor is a main component of mine. 💁🏻 . My brand has a big personality. It's voice and personality is probably even more well-defined than the visual branding. But are you paying as much attention to your "non-visual" branding as much as your logo, colors, and fonts? . To get help defining your voice, check out my guest post on @thesavvycommunity for questions you can ask yourself to vocalize your brand! 🙌  Head on over to bberg.me/savvy-voice 🎉

I get asked a lot what "working brighter" means. Well, it means that years ago, I was really into working smarter but found all of the existing productivity advice insanely boring, despite how good the underlying knowledge was. . It became my mission to infuse productivity with a little more color - starting with myself. "Work brighter" became my mantra, what I told myself instead of "work smarter," to remind myself that my business could be both productive and fun! . How do you work brighter instead of just smarter?
https://scontent-hkg3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/beaa7e5d0ec9b5fe9ebdffaab831a5ee/5BC766AC/t51.2885-15/e35/18251901_1414713075255907_6368879910861144064_n.jpg
For the last day of @ashley.beaudin 's #theimperfectboss campaign, I'm reminding myself that I'm strong as hell for running a business at all. 💪 . A lot of you know I started my business because of a diagnosis. When most people would be scaling back, I took on this huge challenge. I've kept it going through 2 years of illness. That in itself is ENOUGH. . Last year, and still today to a lesser extent, I struggled A LOT with comparison and feeling like I wasn't doing enough because I wasn't launching as much as other people, running a Facebook group, doing webinars, offering packages...I did SO much less than other entrepreneurs. I blogged and had a course and didn't do much else last year. . This year, I still do a lot less than other entrepreneurs. But I'm still doing SOOO much more than it would be perfectly acceptable and understandable to under these circumstances. . Now I'm proud and grateful to not only keep up with a full-time job on top of a full-time illness, but also to also find the strength somewhere be able to build this business and community on top of that.

I feel so Leslie Knope participating in #TheImperfectBoss! 😍 🎉 👯 . When I started my Facebook group earlier this year, I mapped out the kind of place I wanted it to be and I knew I wanted it to be different than all the groups where people just drop into to promo themselves once a week. . What I realized is that I wanted my community to feel like a 24/7 Galentine's day (literally, I have this written on a brainstorming sheet somewhere), and that if every woman in my audience is Ann Perkins, I want to be her Leslie Knope (also mapped out on a post-it). . And let me tell you, I don't think I've ever felt more Knope than when I'm celebrating other women's awesomeness! 🙌

This time for @ashley.beaudin's @imperfectbosses campaign, instead of focusing on our flaws, we're talking about what makes us #flawless (I woke up like this 💁🏻)! And I love it! . While I may be kind of shy sometimes and very introverted always, one of my superpowers is knowing how to bring the [dance] party to business. Helping you make your brand bright, your content colorful, and your engagement entertaining. 🦄 🎉 🙌 . But instead of a mullet with business in the front and party in the back, I have a curly topknot - it says both "I'm here to get shit done," as well as "my hair is crazy and so am I." 💁🏻

Because Tina Fey always speaks the truth 🙌 I must confess, I did not have a productive Saturday. And I must confess, I'm completely fine with that. 💁🏻 . (Tina Fey and her masterpieces of comedy may or may not have anything to do with that...*cough* binging Kimmy Schmidt before season 3 comes out next month *cough* 🙄) . Did your Saturday help you feel in control of your life? 😝

Blog Update Woohoo!!! 🎉 . Entrepreneurs are a busy bunch, usually on purpose. We need to have solid ways to reign in the chaos. Multiple techniques and systems to organize our time. .

LET'S PLAY A GAME 🎉 Choose a Tom Haverford quote to describe your biz and leave it in the comments! .

When @lushcosmetics has a robot bath bomb and the smell makes you nauseous but you have to buy it anyway because bot 😍 🤖 . Whenever there's a shakeup in the world of social media automation (*cough* Instagress *cough*), there's that conversation about whether or not you can automate social media and still "be social." . I'm here to say of fucking course you can. . Lemme tell you something. I automate like 90% of my social media activity. Reading through my profile, watching my Insta story...would you say I'm not human, authentic, or social on social media? I can wait while you take a look. 🙄 . It's completely possible to use automation to streamline social media marketing and still build real relationships and be social and authentic. You don't have to choose. . Just automate things like research and analytics and posting instead of having a bot go out and try to build relationships for you. . I mean, that's a simplified version of the guidelines, but still. . Now it's time for my plug - in my free challenge, #AutomateYourCreativeBiz, there is literally an entire day dedicated to human ways to automate social media. If you have trouble finding the balance between automation/scheduling and being real, I'm here to help you out! 🙌 . You can sign up at bberg.me/aycb or through the link in my bio for free today! 🎉

@beingbossclub gets me 🙌 How do you work your nerd-alerts into your biz? . The whole "building a biz based on your passions" sometimes gets some hate, but like basically everything ever, it's just a balancing act. Sometimes true, sometimes not. . I'm all about working you nerd-out moments into what you're good at. I love TV, but would probably fail at any job in that industry. So instead, I've found ways to work that passion into what I'm good at, build it into my brand, and make TV and content marketing fit together. . Tell me how you've worked your passions into a biz that's not completely based on them!

Do you need to spring clean your productivity? I have the power-up for you! . Last year, I spent a whole day reflecting and overhauling my productivity to "make" room in my schedule to create and launch my first course. Mission accomplished! . I ended up taking the questions and exercises that I created for myself that day and putting them together into a workbook to help anyone perform an "audit." . Grab it for $19 at ProductivityPowerUp. co to check-in on your systems, habits, and tools to figure out what's working and what's not.

Real talk time: @AlistairLovesYou is the perfect kind of leader I wanna be, and walking into his Beyoncé class last year has managed to impact almost every area of my life + job imaginable. . There are SO many aspects of the @BroadwayBodies community that have inspired me, but the most important thing I've learned is to try to make people comfortable. . I never want my community to feel like customers, I want you to be friends and family, like the big hug I feel when I walk into dance class. And for you to feel comfy with me, I have to show my ridiculous self first. 😝 . So I sing. I dance. I wear a unicorn onesie. 🦄 . Meeting so many of you over Skype the past few weeks and having that *immediate* connection even though we were talking to each other's faces for the first time, I've never been more hopeful that I actually CAN be the Leslie Knope-style cheerleader I want to be for all of you (you noble land mermaids). 😍 . This "Skype date challenge" I've been doing was scary as hell when the responses first started coming in, but um...when can we do it again?!

It's been a few weeks and a lot of new followers since I last did one, so I'd say it's time for some #FridayIntroductions! . I'm Brittany, a content unicorn 🦄 and productivity geek 🤓 who helps other female solopreneurs work brighter and create unicorn content. . On the "work brighter" side, I help solopreneurs add more color and less boring to their businesses by automating all the things and getting more done. . On the content side, I'm help entrepreneurs remix and optimize their old "bleh" content to make it more "blam!" 🎉 I've been helping businesses get wins from content for the past 7 years, and sometime soon I'm going to have a special package just for creatives that I CANNOT wait to unleash. 😍 . I'm also filled with sass, sitcom quotes, and McDonald's French Fries. Can't wait to get to know you better! 🙌

Because sometimes on Mondays we need a reminder 😀🦄 🙌

Creating in-depth content can take a LOT of research and planning. To come up with ideas, to understand its audience, to get the information for the actual content. . It's just another reason why writing what you know is SO important. 📝 . Right now, I spend maybe 3-4 hours total on each post, which is pretty fast for the length and topics. But they're topics I’m really, really familiar with, so I come prepared! 💁🏻 . I have ideas for days, collected links, examples, statistics, and stories in my back pocket, don’t have to do a ton of research, and am overall very comfortable talking about these things. Writing about something you’re familiar with has a bigger impact on content creation time than you think. . But collecting all that is nothing if you don't organize it now and reference it in the future. . How do you organize information for the topics you write about?

Now for my favorite #BuildYourOwnVA story of them all! 😍 Rae implemented the stuff from the course *hardcore* and has a FANTASTIC story about it, so I'm not even going to write you something today, I'm just pasting her whole thang! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . "I save time and energy by having several tiny, time-consuming, and repetitive tasks on autopilot. Since setting up Zapier and IFTTT, all of my different business systems and software now communicate with each other and do so seamlessly. It's as if they have been molded into one unique software for my business needs. . Working in a service-based industry, I generate revenue by working on my clients' projects, not my own. BYOVA has allowed me to save time operating and marketing my business, giving me the opportunity to take on another client without having to work longer days. That means I earn more money without having to work more hours and, for that, I can't thank Brittany enough for creating BYOVA. . I've set up nearly 30 automations in IFTTT and Zapier alone - that's at least 30 tiny tasks eliminated from my to-do list each day. While I'm happy to save time, I've found the best part about automating tasks is not even having to think about doing them. Now I run my business and my business doesn't run me." . BEST STUDENT EVERRRR 😍 . And you can join her before the price goes up in May! Head to BuildYourOwnVA . com or the link in my bio to learn more about how to make your life better with bots! 🤖

If you've been following along, you know my biggest brilliant plan for Q1 was optimizing my email marketing systems for affiliate marketing and going through @michelleschro 's Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing course. 🎉 . It's how March was my most profitable month ever, even though it was my most absent month ever from my biz. I didn't even need to write any new blog posts or schedule a ton of tweets blasting out my affiliate link with zero context 🤔 - this money came solely from my email list. 💰 . Michelle is running a 15% off sale on Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing until Sunday, and I cannot recommend it enough for helping you make more money from the content you've already created! 🤘 And to help you even more, I wrote an ebook about my affiliate marketing email system and the crazy targeted segmentation I have set up so I can send weekly affiliate emails without annoying my subscribers. 💁🏻 . To cash in on this sah-weet, sweet offer, head over to bberg.me/msoam (my affiliate link) and use the coupon code 28APRIL at checkout. I'll get a notification, and you'll get my bonus ebook to help you implement Michelle's main tips! 🙌

In today's #BuildYourOwnVA spotlight: @allyssabarnes! Because I love that she's created "systems that ran themselves"🤘 . So, Allyssa's deal before becoming BFFs with automation was that she was kinda organized and had a few systems in place, but they took a lot of time and effort on her part, so they were hurting her productivity more than helping it. . But once she actually started using IFTTT and Zapier, she was able to make all her biz tools talk to each other, saving her from having to log into things all the time. Instead, it's all automated! 🤖 . Watch the first lesson of Build Your Own VA and see if it's right for you too - find it through the link in my bio! 🎉

One thing I've done more than ever in 2017 is make an effort to take social media and Slack friendships further. I'm not necessarily talking IRL...let's not get crazy, I'm just find connecting from my couch 💁🏻...but talking to friends over DMs and email, having Skype dates, and stuff like that! . And the biggest thing I did was start my own Facebook group - FINALLY - for all my best online frands, students, and community members. We are the unicorns. 🦄 . Every time I post in that group, I feel so loved. We're not constantly promo-ing and there's not engagement prompts every 👏 single 👏 day 👏, but damn, do we have some fun! 🎉 . We had a Galentine's Day chat. We're going to have a bingewatch party for the Girlboss TV show hitting Netflix. And last week, I put out an open call for Skype dates, thinking *maybe* one or two people would want to talk. My stretch goal was three. . A few days later, and I already have ELEVEN Skype dates set up with fellow unicorn solopreneurs! 🦄 I was floored at how many people came through! . I'm putting it out there: my unicorns are amazing. You want to be one. Follow the link in my bio to join us. 🎉 😍 🦄

Ack! I've been going through all the #BuildYourOwnVA testimonials as I make updates to the sales page, and forgot how great they are. 😍 Had to whip up a few pretty squares to share them with you! 😝 . @sarafrandina was literally the first person to press the "Enroll" button and has used a ton of recipes and zaps to automate her inbox and Slack teams! Like, did you know you can get notifications for emails from important clients via Slack, so you don't have to keep your inbox open all day? Sara said it was a gamechanger for her! . If you need to get out of your inbox too, Build Your Own VA helps you prioritize and streamline your crazy email situation. 💁🏻 You can even watch the first lesson for free before you enroll to make sure I know what I'm talking about. 😝 .

Crazy excited to share my #Femtrepreneur case study with you! . Last year was NOT great. If you hung around here then, you know how rough things got. Between juggling my full-time job and freelance biz, and managing my chronic illness a full-time job in its own right, my biz wasn't going to keep going unless I made some major changes. . Queue joining Launch Your Signature Course and creating and launching my own course in less than six weeks while working on the side of my day job and between doctor's appointments. I even took several days off from *everything* during my launch! . In my case study, I talk about why I so ruthlessly prioritized which launch elements I was gonna include and how I just made them fierce af instead of getting fancy schmancy. 💁🏻 Head through to the link in my bio to read it!

I've been really focusing on my physical and mental health this year (see my recent story), and with that obviously comes mindset work. . But ya know what? Most resources out there about mindset just don't seem to "fit" me. They leave me feeling less inspired and more pessimistic and feeling like I cant be successful without being "woo-woo." . What does work? Dancing. Nothing gets me in a better place quicker than a shimmy! 💁🏻 Try it!

Do you make sure to spend time catching up on your favorite content, no matter how busy you are? . I know that when you're overwhelmed by all the content you have to create, you want to build a writing cave blanket fort, hide away, and ignore everything everyone else is out there creating. 🙈 . After all, isn't that all just triggers for comparison trap and distractions keeping you from getting your own content done? . And to that I say...a big ole NOPEEEEEE. 💁🏻 . When you have a lot to do, you need to get motivated and get inspired. And what's more inspiring than epic content! 🙌 . When you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, spending 30 minutes reading some of your favorite blogs or watching your favorite YouTube channels can make a world of a difference!. . What's the first blog you go to when you need that kick in the ass?

Let's talk about scheduling and automation! They're obviously my favorite ways to streamline some systems, get shit done, feel like a Time Lord, and have more time for Netflix and naps. 💁🏻 . But, you see...they're not the same thing. And yet lots of solopreneurs use the words interchangeably. No wonder productivity can seem so confusing! 🙈 . In my latest blog post, I'm comparing and contrasting the two most awesome productivity techniques for entrepreneurs. Learn what the difference is, how they can both help your biz, and the best times to use each. The more ya know, the more productive you'll be! 🙌 .

Does anyone else feel like procrastination can be a perfectionist's best friend? Nothing makes you kill perfectionist habits like a looming deadline. . When the show's about to go on and there's work to be done, you let go of nitpickiness and focus on only the most important things.

Mmmmm, in my house, weekend mornings are for mallows 😍 😍 😍 . I'm usually too rushed on weekday mornings to put any kind of hot beverage near my face 🙈, but damnnnn I love my mallows!

As content creators, we don't always give our ideas enough credit. We publish something epic, spend a few days promoting it, and then it's onto the next one like Jay-Z. . Why? Your audience isn't done learning about that idea! They want more! So when a topic *works,* when they go gaga for it, keep repurposing the fuck out of it until they've learned everything they can.

Fran Drescher. Christopher Walken. James Earl Jones. . Some people just have immediately recognizable voices. When James announces, “This is CNN,” it doesn’t matter that you can’t see his face…you know it’s him. MUFASAAAAAA! 🙌 . That’s something we should all be clawing at for our online businesses. To be able to speak anywhere, on any website – or even IRL! – without your logo or brand colors, and still have people know it’s you? . That’s the ultimate branding feat, and I’m gonna help you “feat” it. 😉 Follow the link in my bio (or type berg.me/savvy-voice) to read my @thesavvycommunity guest post about making your brand voice #unbreakable and strong as hell!💪💪

I've been gearing up for a few podcasts and speaking applications lately, so I just revamped my "profesh" bio (although let's be real, all my content is casual), so for this week's #FridayIntroductions, I'd love to know what you think! 😀 . I'm a content unicorn who helps other entrepreneurs work brighter, stand out, and grow their unicorn businesses. 🦄 . I accepted my first content marketing job in 2010, without even knowing that’s what it was. Since then, I've built and run amazing content teams at software companies while managing two personal blogs and a freelance writing business on the side. . If that sounds like a lot, it’s because it is. If it sounds like fun, it’s because it’s that too! 🙌 . So in 2016, I started teaching other crazy (and I mean crazy) ambitious women how to be more productive in their online businesses so they’ll have time for all the things they want to do, too. 💁🏻

She's going to teach us: - How to finally create a system that gets real results - The step to profiting from Pinterest that most people are missing - How to gain 100+ followers in your first 7 days (even if you're starting from scratch) .

Let's talk about Trello. . The app is a-mah-zing for planning and organizing, and that stuff is so important. But you need to focus on the doing, not just the planning and organizing, so maybe you need to find another way to get that stuff done. . Because every hour spent organizing your launch in Trello is another hour that you’re not creating your launch content, building affiliate relationships, or doing all the stuff that your Trello cards are telling you to do in the first place. . Once you think about that, the idea of streamlining your Kanban time sounds a little more appealing. . I'm super super super excited to be on the @thinkcreativecollective blog talking about all the ways you can do that with automation! 🙌 . Head on over to bberg.me/TCCtrello to read my tips!

On oddly nice (and, let's be real, confusing...) days like today, I love living in a city where you never run out of places to explore, even in your own neighborhood. 😍 .

Hokay! Let's play "sweet treat Tuesday," a world-famous game that I made up 5 seconds ago. 🎉 . If you got to reward yourself after completing whatever task you're working on now, how big of a sweet treat would it deserve? Are you working on something epic cupcake-worthy?

Binge watching Gilmore Girls on a Saturday morning = Netflix and Chilton 💁🏻 . How are you relaxing this weekend? . (✏️ from @lzpencils )

Remember that time I made $100 in 15 minutes? I am NOTTTTTTT a passive income success story yet (seriously I *cannot* stress that enough), so I sure do! 💁🏻 . If you've been following along the past few months, you know my health hasn't been great. I haven't had the time or strength to do a ton of content creation, especially new paid content. I actually ended up delaying my launch until March when it was originally planned for January. :( . Thankfully, I had a lot of time to experiment with new ideas that didn't involve creating new content. @michelleschro was running a sale on her affiliate marketing course, so I grabbed it and started optimizing my existing content and marketing strategies for the affiliate programs I was in! 💰 . I'll be honest - I haven't turned into one of those affiliate geniuses, and I haven't had a lot of wins. But I have done a few mini-experiments, and 3 of them turned out really well and are things I'm starting to focus on more now! 🙌 I just published a blog post talking all about them. 😀 . Michelle is running another sale on the course from now until Sunday, and you can start using this strategy too! And as a bonus, if you buy it during this promotion, you'll get the free case study ebook about my one of my own affiliate marketing strategies based on the tactics you learn in her course! . Go to the link in my bio for more details on the sale and bonus offer. 😀

Running your own creative biz comes with a lot of necessary evils. 🙄 . When you’re a creative working for someone else, you don’t have to worry about management, finances, marketing, and all that. You just did your creative job. . But when you’re a creative running the whole damn show, there’s a lot of uncreative, frankly boring, things you have to bother yourself with. 😂 . Ugh. Sucks. . But totally worth it in the grand scheme of things, right?! . So that’s why we need to go Full Court Mary Poppins on that part of creativepreneurship: in every job that must be done, there is an element of fun! 💁🏻 So we take that fun, amplify it, and streamline the rest! 🙌 . This week on the blog, I wrote about how to take all those sucky parts of your biz, and make them a little more bearable! 🎉 . Go to bberg.me/time-sucks or click the link in my bio to unsuck your biz now. 🤘 . . . . . . . . . #Workbrighter #unicornsolopreneur #solopreneur #ladypreneur #blogbffs #immtribe #tcctribe #femtrepreneur #beingboss #savvybusinessowner #thesavvycommunity #creativepreneur #creativeentrepreneur #mycreativebiz #onewomanshop #infopreneur #tnchustler #socialboss #buildingmyempire #ladybiz #girlboss #communityovercompetition #thegirlgang #thegramgang #creativechics #femaleentrepreneur #abmhappylife #abmlifeiscolorful #myunicornlife

Jumping on the "do less, better" bandwagon, but wtf not? 💁🏻 . There are lots of weeks when I can't create new content. One way I've found to stay busy during those weeks is to really focus on going through my old work and improving it, optimizing it, awesomizing it. . I may not be coming out with a cool new offer or doing a video series or a podcast or a YouTube channel, so it can sometimes feel like I don't get to do any cool awesome content things. . But by going back to basics and squeezing more out of every piece of content under my brand, I'm spreading awesomeness little by little to every thing I've ever created for it. . How are you making your existing content more awesome this year?

Listening to this quote from @beingbossclub a few weeks ago had me doing all the IRL "preach" emojis 🙌 . In public. A crowded public. It's fine. . But this quote right here SO PERFECTLY sums up the reasoning behind most things I do. My family has always said I "don't do casual interest." Either I couldn't care less about something, or I'm writing odes, traveling to events, buying fan tchotchkes on Etsy and Ebay, planning cons and cosplay. 🙄 . And I run my biz with that same passion. I just DON'T DO CASUAL INTEREST. If I'm gonna commit my time and interest into something, I'm probs going balls to the wall and geeking the freak out about it. . I want to be doing things that get me excited and bring out my inner nerd (although let's be real, that nerdiness is also in plain sight) all the time. That means writing for every marketing blog that'll have me, reading lots of trashy romance, and binging on pop culture podcasts, at the moment. What are you nerding over? . . . . . . #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

#BlogTheRainbow: Low Tech Living . As much as I talk about apps and automation, we all know I'm a paper planner and notebook girl at heart 😍 I mean honestly, take a scroll lol. .

#BlogTheRainbow: Arts and Crafts . I don't have much space for arts and crafts in our apartment (the horror 😂), so I have to go home to my mom's studio for any really epic crafting (and I do - she's better and I need her help anyway! 💁🏻) . But I've started collecting TONS of coloring books. For the most part, not even adult coloring books. Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears, Spongebob...they better match my maturity level. . But a few times a week, I'll set a timer, forget about any to-dos or due dates I have looming, turn on something hilarious, and color for about an hour. It's fun, it's mindless, and it's making self-care a priority. 🙌 . . . #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

Have you ever felt like you're just FULL UP in terms of your time? Like you're super productive but still somehow not getting anything done. - You set goals. You come up with sprints.

Work smarter instead. - Don't let boring to-dos keep you from the stuff at the heart of your creative biz!

#BlogTheRainbow: Memory Lane (also: removing all doubt I was meant to be a writer) 📝 - Fun fact: my elementary school's PTA had a "publishing house" where students could write "books," parents would staple them into a cardboard "cover" covered in fabric from an old pillowcase, and we'd be published authors! 💁🏻 - Going through some stuff over the weekend, I found one of the books I published in 4th grade, clearly tied to a school assignment about westward expansion since it's about a family on the Oregon Trail. 🙈 - And guys, if I ever doubted I was meant to be a writer, this book would remove it. I was honestly surprised by this book. I made a dysentery joke. What 9-year-old sits and writes dysentery jokes? 🙄 I probably spent SO much time on those. - - - #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

#BlogTheRainbow Day 9 🤘 . Today's prompt is cause awareness. I didn't want to pick a specific one, because there are several that are really important to me, and several gropus - both formal and informal - I've gotten involved with. One thing they all have in common? While the causes aren't female-specific, the groups I'm taking action with are. . These women are the shit. They've inspired me to educate myself, get involved, and be confident. They're helping me improve myself as well as improve the world around me, and I love them. 😍 . . . . . . #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

#BlogTheRainbow Day 2: Health is Wealth 💁🏻 . Here's my health journal - it's very cute to make up for the fact that it's full of logs that make me sad. It's the logs of my diet, symptom occurrences, and medication schedules for managing my chronic illness. . Because of that little fucker, lately my #1 priority for my career has been to "not try as hard or care as much." Kind of counter to what most business goals are, right? Welp, it is what it is. 🙄 . And normally, I really, really, really suck at that. I. am. not. good. at. managing. my. health. and. self-care. . But guess what? Guess what? I took TWO sick days in the month of January. Working days where I actually didn't work. At all. I consider that AMAZING. In all of 2016, I only ever actually took off work if I was in the hospital or having surgery. Despite spending *most* of the year sick. Instead I would just work from bed or the floor. I even worked from the hospital guys, more than once. Idk why my boyfriend believed I just wanted my laptop for Netflix. . And there were still days this month where I pushed myself too hard and accidentally let my health take a backseat to work, which is why it got so bad last week (if you follow my Insta stories), but overall I'm REALLY proud of myself. 😀 . . . . . . #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

God, Nora Ephron was brilliant. 💥 . If you try to cram everything in you want to do, you can, but it will be messy. It's up to you whether or not you can embrace the mess. . Me? I'm all about the messy. . Is it bat crap crazy that I have a day job, a freelancing biz, an infoproduct biz, a book blog, and a dance hobby? Absolutely. I'm not so crazy that I can't even recognize that I'm crazy. 💁🏻 . But they're each non-negotiable to me for a different reason, so I fucking make it work and embrace the mess! . . . . . . #workbrighter #solopreneur #solobiz #tnchustler #femtrepreneur #fempreneur #theeverygirl #onewomanshop #creativeentrepreneur #creativepreneur #mycreativebiz #girlboss #ladybiz #savvybusinessowner #creativebusiness #womeninbusiness #femaleentrepreneur #beingboss #thatsdarling #forloveandmoney #tcctribe #calledtobecreative #immtribe

The future is female. . By @all_womankind . I'm not marching today...I'm not strong enough this week for cold, crowds, or walking and I wouldn't feel safe going out there. . But the exact reasons that I'm not there are the reasons that I am so, so, so thankful and grateful for all of the nasty women and men out there today. Keep marching, keep fighting. We're stronger together. 🙌
