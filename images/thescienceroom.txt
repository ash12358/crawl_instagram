This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta. The steep inner slopes are carved by gullies and include possible recurring slope lineae on the equator-facing slopes. Fresh craters often have steep, active slopes, so the HiRISE team is monitoring this crater for changes over time. The bedrock lithology is also diverse.

Our Spitzer Space Telescope found tentative evidence for one such planet around a dead star, or white dwarf, called PG 0010+280 (depicted as white dot in illustration). Years ago, astronomers predicted that some massive, Jupiter-like planets might accumulate mass from their dying stars. As stars like our sun age, they puff up into red giants and then gradually lose about half or more of their mass, shrinking into skeletons of stars, called white dwarfs. The dying stars blow winds of material outward that could fall onto giant planets that might be orbiting in the outer reaches of the star system.

Ebola researchers take samples from an insect-eating, Angolan free-tailed bat in the West #African country of #IvoryCoast. Virologists and others in the research community have long suspected that bats play a role in spreading the Ebola virus from the natural world into humans and primates. Ebola antibodies were discovered in certain species of fruit bats, however, the presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean that those bats were the natural host of the virus. These tiny insect bats, such as the one being sampled here, became a species of interest after researchers learned that they were heavily present in the Guinean village where the first cases in the West African outbreak appeared. From the samples, researchers hope to grow live virus in highly secured laboratories. Being able to grow the virus from samples is the gold standard of determining a reservoir host.

#Repost @nasa with @repostapp. ・・・ Since measurements began in 1895, Alaska’s Hubbard Glacier has been thickening and steadily advancing into Disenchantment Bay. The advance runs counter to so many thinning and retreating glaciers nearby in Alaska and around the world. This image, acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, shows Hubbard Glacier on July 22, 2014. According to Leigh Stearns, a glaciologist at the University of Kansas, Hubbard’s advance is due to its large accumulation area; the glacier’s catchment basin extends far into the Saint Elias Mountains. Snow that falls in the basin either melts or flows down to the terminus, causing Hubbard to steadily grow. In addition, Hubbard is building up a large moraine, shoveling sediment, rock, and other debris from Earth’s surface onto the glacier’s leading edge. The moraine at the front gives the glacier stability and allows it to advance more easily because the ice does not need to be as thick to stay grounded. (If it is thin, it can start floating and will not necessarily advance.) Image Credit: NASA/Earth Observatory #earth #nasa #earthrightnow #climate #hubbard #glacier #science

#Repost @nasagoddard with @repostapp. ・・・ Hubble Catches Stellar Exodus in Action Using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have captured for the first time snapshots of fledging white dwarf stars beginning their slow-paced, 40-million-year migration from the crowded center of an ancient star cluster to the less populated suburbs. White dwarfs are the burned-out relics of stars that rapidly lose mass, cool down and shut off their nuclear furnaces. As these glowing carcasses age and shed weight, their orbits begin to expand outward from the star cluster’s packed downtown. This migration is caused by a gravitational tussle among stars inside the cluster. Globular star clusters sort out stars according to their mass, governed by a gravitational billiard ball game where lower mass stars rob momentum from more massive stars. The result is that heavier stars slow down and sink to the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and move across the cluster to the edge. This process is known as "mass segregation." Until these Hubble observations, astronomers had never definitively seen the dynamical conveyor belt in action. Astronomers used Hubble to watch the white-dwarf exodus in the globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, a dense swarm of hundreds of thousands of stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The cluster resides 16,700 light-years away in the southern constellation Tucana. Credits: NASA, ESA, and H. Richer and J.

COTs starfish can grow 14 or more inches across and may have as many as 21 arms. Long, stiff spines protruding from the animal’s arms and crown-like central disk (thus the name) contain powerful venom. When a predator—or anyone unfortunate enough to step on or otherwise touch a COTS—gets too close, the spines deliver a painful sting and may also embed in the unwary intruder’s flesh. In this photo, Kelly injects the crown-of-thorns starfish with ox bile, a natural substance that kills the creature, but does no harm to the reef.

#Repost @noaa with @repostapp. ・・・ Today is #EndangeredSpeciesDay. Every year on the third Friday in May, #ESDay recognizes and support national efforts to protect our #endangeredspecies and their #habitats. This totally adorable #HawaiianMonkSeal is among the most endangered and #rarest animal species in the world. Endemic to the #HawaiianIslands, it’s protected under the Endangered Species Act (#ESA), #Marine #Mammal Protection Act (#MMPA) and Hawaiian state law. A majority of the population lives within Hawaii’s #Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument — one of the world’s largest marine protected areas. Despite this, the overall population is declining, and only about 1,100 seals remain. To learn more about the Hawaiian monk seal, visit http://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/seals/hawaiian-monk-seal.html As the ESA enters its 5th decade, #NOAA and our partners are developing new technologies and management approaches to ensure the ESA remains effective and that endangered species populations and their habitats can rebound and recover. In fact, @NOAAFisheries just launched “Species in the Spotlight,” a focused effort to protect and recover 8 marine species at risk of extinction — including the Hawaiian monk #seal. The recently released Recovering Threatened and Endangered Species FY 2013-2014 Report to Congress summarizes our efforts to recover all threatened and endangered marine species in the United States.

READ THE TEXT BELOW!! #Repost @nasa with @repostapp. ・・・ Decades of satellite observations and astronaut photographs show that clouds dominate space-based views of Earth. One study based on nearly a decade of satellite data estimated that about 67 percent of Earth’s surface is typically covered by clouds. This is especially the case over the oceans, where other research shows less than 10 percent of the sky is completely clear of clouds at any one time. Over land, 30 percent of skies are completely cloud free. Earth’s cloudy nature is unmistakable in this global cloud fraction map, based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on our Aqua satellite. While MODIS collects enough data to make a new global map of cloudiness every day, this version of the map shows an average of all of the satellite’s cloud observations between July 2002 and April 2015. Colors range from dark blue (no clouds) to light blue (some clouds) to white (frequent clouds).

#Repost @nasa with @repostapp. ・・・ Martian Sunset! The sun dips to a Martian horizon in a blue-tinged sky in images sent home to Earth this week from our Curiosity Mars rover. Curiosity used its Mast Camera (Mastcam) to record the sunset during an evening of skywatching on April 15, 2015. The imaging was done between dust storms, but some dust remained suspended high in the atmosphere. The sunset observations help researchers assess the vertical distribution of dust in the atmosphere. "The colors come from the fact that the very fine dust is the right size so that blue light penetrates the atmosphere slightly more efficiently," said Mark Lemmon of Texas A&M University, College Station, the Curiosity science-team member who planned the observations. "When the blue light scatters off the dust, it stays closer to the direction of the sun than light of other colors does. The rest of the sky is yellow to orange, as yellow and red light scatter all over the sky instead of being absorbed or staying close to the sun."

SPRING-STRING-STRONG!!! This means that when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a line (string), the high tides are the highest and the low tides are the lowest (strong). This is called a Spring Tide, and has nothing to do with the season, actually. Neap Tides are the opposite. The Sun and Moon are working against each other, and both tides are weaker.

#Repost @noaa with @repostapp. ・・・ Talk about a lot of #snow! With all the snow the #Northeast has received recently, we wanted to share this #ThrowbackThursday photo showing a man standing next to a nearly buried utility pole in Jamestown, North Dakota. This photo was taken on March 9, 1966, after a major #blizzard blew through the area. Based on this image alone, taken from the #NOAA National Geophysical Data Center's Dr. Herbert Kroehl photo collection, it is easy to see how this storm was an all-time record breaker for North Dakota in terms of amount of snowfall, sustained severity, low visibilities. During this blizzard, #winds reported over 70 mph continued unabated for up to four days in some areas. Snowfall, reported as much as 38 inches in the northeastern part of the state, was piled into mountainous drifts 30 to 40 feet high in many places. Many towns and schools were closed, business was suspended, newspapers failed to publish, and all forms of traffic came to a complete halt.  #TBT #sciencesaveslives #winter #snowfall #storm  #staywarm! #instacold #instafreeze #NWS

Jupiter's four largest moons can commonly be seen transiting the face of the giant planet and casting shadows onto its cloud tops. However, seeing three moons transiting the face of Jupiter at the same time is rare, occurring only once or twice a decade. Missing from the sequence, taken on January 24, 2015, is the moon Ganymede that was too far from Jupiter in angular separation to be part of the conjunction. #Hubble #nasagoddard #galaxy #jupiter #space

#Repost @nasagoddard with @repostapp. ・・・ There’s more than one way to study the impact of biofuels. For NASA scientists, it means trailing an aircraft from as little as 300 feet behind while flying 34,000 feet in the air. Earlier this year, a NASA-led team conducted a series of carefully choreographed flights over California in order to sniff out how aircraft emissions differ when using petroleum fuels or biofuels. Early results from the Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions (ACCESS II) experiment confirm that blended biofuel is the cleaner-burning fuel. "Our findings show we definitely see a 50 percent reduction in soot emissions from the DC-8 when it burns the blended fuel as opposed to jet fuel alone," said Bruce Anderson, ACCESS principal investigator from NASA's Langley Research Center. The DC-8 is a NASA science workhorse: a flying laboratory equipped to collect—or, in this case, produce—data for basic Earth science research. During the ACESS experiment, scientists took advantage of the aircraft's segregated fuel tank. On the fly, the pilot switched the fuel type sent to each of the four engines. The engines burned either jet fuel, or a 50-50 blend of jet fuel and a renewable alternative produced from camelina plant oil. With each change of fuel, three other instrumented aircraft took turns lining up in the DC-8's wake and flying anywhere from 90 meters (300 feet) to more than 30 kilometers (20 miles) behind to catch a sniff.

A visible picture captured at 1600 UTC (11 a.m. EST) showed the effects of the latest Arctic outbreak. The cold front that brought the Arctic air has moved as far south as Florida, and stretches back over the Gulf of Mexico and just west of Texas today. The image shows clouds behind the frontal boundary stretching from the Carolinas west over the Heartland. Farther north, a wide band of fallen snow covers the ground from New England west to Montana, with rivers appearing like veins. The GOES-East satellite image also shows wind-whipped lake-effect snows off the Great Lakes, blowing to the southeast. Meanwhile, Florida, the nation's warm spot appeared almost cloud-free. The forecast from NOAA's National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center (WPC) calls for more snow along the Appalachian Mountains from Tennessee north to upstate New York. Snow is also expected to fall from New England west to Montana, and in eastern New Mexico and the Colorado Rockies. The WPC summary for Jan. 7 noted: Bitter cold will be felt from the western High Plains to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S. for the next few days. Widespread subzero overnight lows are forecast for the Dakotas, Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior New England. Wind Chill Advisories and Warnings are in effect for many of these areas.

This one is on the island of Bohol. From Wikipedia - It is a member of the approximately 45-million-year-old family Tarsiidae, whose name is derived from its elongated "tarsus" or ankle bone. It is the only member of the genus Carlito. Like all tarsiers, the Philippine tarsier's eyes are fixed in its skull; they cannot turn in their sockets. Instead, a special adaptation in the neck allows its round head to be rotated 180 degrees. The eyes are disproportionately large, having the largest eye-to-body size ratio of all mammals. @thephotosociety @theimagereview #asia #philippines #tarsier #cute #weird #travel #mammal #wildlife

#Repost @nasagoddard with @repostapp. ・・・ Hubble sees a galaxy 60 million light-years away This new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows the galaxy IC 335 in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies. IC 335 is part of a galaxy group containing three other galaxies, and located in the Fornax Galaxy Cluster 60 million light-years away. As seen in this image, the disk of IC 335 appears edge-on from the vantage point of Earth. This makes it harder for astronomers to classify it, as most of the characteristics of a galaxy’s morphology — the arms of a spiral or the bar across the center — are only visible on its face. Still, the 45 000 light-year-long galaxy could be classified as an S0 type. These lenticular galaxies are an intermediate state in galaxy morphological classification schemes between true spiral and elliptical galaxies. They have a thin stellar disk and a bulge, like spiral galaxies, but in contrast to typical spiral galaxies they have used up most of the interstellar medium. Only a few new stars can be created out of the material that is left and the star formation rate is very low. Hence, the population of stars in S0 galaxies consists mainly of aging stars, very similar to the star population in elliptical galaxies.

#Repost @nasa with @repostapp. ・・・ NASA's Mars Curiosity rover has measured a tenfold spike in methane, an organic chemical, in the atmosphere around it and detected other organic molecules in a rock-powder sample collected by the robotic laboratory’s drill. Researchers used Curiosity’s onboard Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) laboratory a dozen times in a 20-month period to sniff methane in the atmosphere. During two of those months, in late 2013 and early 2014, four measurements averaged seven parts per billion. Before and after that, readings averaged only one-tenth that level. Curiosity also detected different Martian organic chemicals in powder drilled from a rock dubbed Cumberland, the first definitive detection of organics in surface materials of Mars. These Martian organics could either have formed on Mars or been delivered to Mars by meteorites. Organic molecules, which contain carbon and usually hydrogen, are chemical building blocks of life, although they can exist without the presence of life. Curiosity's findings from analyzing samples of atmosphere and rock powder do not reveal whether Mars has ever harbored living microbes, but the findings do shed light on a chemically active modern Mars and on favorable conditions for life on ancient Mars. Pictured here is the drilling into Curiosity's rock target, "Cumberland," during the 279th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars (May 19, 2013). Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS
