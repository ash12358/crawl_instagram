The Taj Mahal, Agra, India.  We entered the gates as the sun was rising and this was my first glimpse of the majestic mausoleum over the heads of the crowd that stood in line before me.

To celebrate Shark Week: Gansbaai, South Africa.  We took a boat out early to shark alley to do our cage dive while the water was still calm and clear. Once we had anchored, the captain told us it could take up to an hour before any nearby Great Whites came by to investigate, but within five minutes, this 13ft beauty came thundering out of the water with teeth bared.

Train traver. Near Bangkok, Thailand.  While taking the over night rail from Chang Mai to Bangkok, our train had some technical trouble and sat idle for 3 hours somewhere in the Thai countryside. Many of the passengers started to get frustrated with the delay, but this woman just sat quietly and watched sun rise over the lush, green landscape.

We arrived in Pushkar a few weeks before the annual Pushkar fair which is one of the largest cattle and camel exchanges in all of India. We had to maneuver through small herds of sacred cattle as we made our way through the tiny town to get to the Holy lake.

Gomor river at sunset, Sundarbans, West Bengal, India.  We spent our first evening anchored off the coast of the tiger reserve and watched the sunset as the local fishermen and honey collectors made their way back to the island before dark.
