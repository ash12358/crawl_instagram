Although, calcium-vitamin D supplements are routinely prescribed for reducing fracture risks in the elderly, there's a consistent lack of scientific evidence that this is helpful... A meta-analysis of 33 randomized clinical trials (involving 51,145 participants) - printed in JAMA in 2017 - comparing the use of supplements containing calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no treatment in reducing fracture risks, concluded that neither was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older people.

TIMELINE OF HEALTH BENEFITS, AFTER SMOKING CESSATION... While cigarette smoking can be a major health risk (see below), the good news is that quitting can help your restore much of your lost health... WHO Fact Sheet on Tobacco (Updated 9 March 2018) 1. Tobacco kills up to half of its users 2. Tobacco kills more than 7 million people each year. More than 6 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while around 890 000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke 3. Around 80% of the world's 1.1 billion smokers live in low- and middle-income countries #DrDee #CONDITIONINGCLINIC

The Lipid Overflow‚ÄìEctopic Fat Model of Metabolic Disorders Excess visceral fat (fat in the abdominal cavity surrounding the viscera - the organs) accumulation is a marker of a dysfunctional adipose tissue unable to appropriately store energy excess. According to this model, the body‚Äôs ability to cope with surplus #calories (resulting from excess caloric consumption, a sedentary #lifestyle or, as is often the case, a combination of both factors combined with a genetic predisposition and an 'obesogenic' environment) might, ultimately, determine the individual‚Äôs susceptibility to developing #metabolicsyndrome. There is evidence suggesting that 1. If the extra energy is channelled into insulin-sensitive #subcutaneous (under the skin) adipose tissue, the individual, although in positive energy balance, will be PROTECTED against the development of the metabolic syndrome (See left column in the accompanying picture). However, 2. In cases in which adipose tissue is absent, deficient or insulin resistant with a limited ability to store the energy excess, the fat surplus will be deposited at ectopic sites (sites which don't normally store fat such as the liver, the heart, the skeletal muscle and in visceral adipose tissue) ‚Äî a phenomenon described as #ectopicfat deposition. Factors associated with a preferential accumulation of visceral fat and with features of insulin resistance include, among others: 1. Smoking, 2. Genetic susceptibility to visceral obesity (such as in Indians) 3. A neuroendocrine profile related to a maladaptive response to stress The resulting metabolic consequences of this ‚Äòdefect‚Äô in energy partitioning include visceral obesity, insulin resistance, an #atherogenic (#atheroma-forming) #dyslipidaemia and a pro-thrombotic, #inflammatory profile; these are characteristic features of metabolic syndrome. Although definitions and diagnostic criteria vary, the simplest #clinical criterion for diagnosing metabolic syndrome is the simultaneous presence of: 1. Increased waist girth, and 2. Raised fasting triacylglycerol levels which together have been termed the ‚Äòhypertriglyceridaemic waist‚Äô.

Inflammation as a Link between Obesity & Metabolic Syndrome Step-wise illustration of how obesity plays a central role in the development of a chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation that leads to metabolic syndrome (Faloia Emanuela, et al., 2012). 'Metabolic syndrome is a complex of clinical features leading to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus in both sexes. Visceral obesity and insulin resistance are considered the main features determining the negative cardiovascular profile in metabolic syndrome.' According to authors of the study quoted here, obesity has a central role in the development of a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state that leads to insulin resistance, endothelial and microvascular (blood vessels) dysfunctions. 'It is thought that the starting signal of this inflammation is overfeeding and the pathway originates in all metabolic cells; the subsequent increase in cytokine production recruits immune cells in the extracellular environment inducing an overall systemic inflammation' SOURCE: Faloia Emanuela, et al., Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism, 2012. #DrDee and #ConditioningClinic dedicated to creating #healthawareness

GAIN MUSCLE (LBM) AND REV UP YOUR METABOLISM?! WELL, I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO... If you gain 0.5 kg of lean body mass (LBM), you get to eat 3 extra grapes a day!

'One of the big fat lies that you may have heard from your personal trainer goes like this: ‚ÄúDude...pack on the muscle and your metabolic rate will go through the roof!‚Äù Besides the fact that there‚Äôs no evidence for this, it makes no teleological sense. In fact, for every pound of LBM you gain, you burn an extra cherry tomato üçÖ a day. Or 3 grapes üçá. That‚Äôs right. Enjoy those 3 grapes. Heck, if you gain 10 pounds of LBM, have an extra banana üçå.

Vitamin K2 (MK-7) may Reduce Cardiovascular Risks of Calcium Supplementation! Elevated consumption of #calcium #supplements may raise the risk for #HeartDisease and can be connected with accelerated deposit of calcium in #BloodVessel walls and soft tissues. In contrast, #VitaminK2 is associated with the inhibition of #ArterialCalcification and arterial stiffening. An increased intake of vitamin K2 could be a means of lowering calcium-associated health risks. SOURCE: Katarzyna Maresz, PhD, Proper Calcium Use: Vitamin K2 as a Promoter of Bone and Cardiovascular Health The use of (calcium,) #vitaminD and vitamin K2 together as an approach to #osteoporosis treatment may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. This approach may rival #bisphosphonate treatment (without the side effects associated with the use biophosphonates), along with reducing vascular calcification and its complications. WORD OF CAUTION: Vitamin K2 in the form of #MK7 is rapidly becoming popular as a supplement and is available OTC usually with a dose of 100‚Äì120 Œºgm. It is important as physicians to be aware that MK-7 can interfere with #anticoagulation therapy when used above 50 Œºgm/day. Newer agents for anticoagulation such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are not vitamin K-dependent. This would allow for the safer use of higher doses of vitamin K to prevent #atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and #cognitive impairment!

The Overweight-Obesity Double Whammy: (Repost) #Overweight and #obesity cause adverse effects in humans on account of two basic pathogenic-etiologic (disease-causing) mechanisms: 1. SICK FAT DISEASE (SFD): Also called '#adiposopathy' by researchers (1), sick fat disease is a condition wherein fat becomes sick (diseased). This causes deranged #immune and #hormonal responses, which then form the basis of #MetabolicDisorders including #diabetes, #cardiovascular diseases, hormonal imbalances, #infertility in both, men and women and #cancer, amongst others (2). 2. FAT MASS DISEASE (FMD): The sheer weight of excess fat, a hallmark of overweight-obesity leads to mechanical problems including, but not limited to, #joint stresses, immobility, tissue friction, tissue compression which can cause high #bloodpressure, #sleepapnea, #gastrointestinal reflux and others (2); researchers call this the 'fat mass disease.' In a nutshell, obesity seems to be a 'chronic, relapsing, multi-factorial neurobehavioural disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes (both) adipose (fat) tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and #psychosocialhealth consequences' (2). TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Obesity isn't a cosmetic problem anymore but a well-recognised disease entity which causes problem on account of both deranged metabolic as well as biomechanical processes. CITATIONS: 1. Bays H.E. et al., Int J Clin Pract, 2008. 2. American Society of Bariatric Physicians' Obesity Algorithm, 2013).

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST (REPOST) Pre-workout Caution! Careful, when you are using a powerful pre-workout or a fat burner, esp. over the weekend... Pre-workout or fat-loss‚Äòthermogenic‚Äô supplements will typically contain a cocktail of ingredients which work by stimulating the adrenergic system - caffeine (the main ingredient), synerphrine (ephedrine alternative), yerba mate (contains 3 stimulant xanthines - caffeine, theobromine, theophylline), yohimbine (stimulant and aphrodisiac), tyramine (monoamine derived from tyrosine, acts as a catecholamine (dopamine, NE, Epi) releasing agent - increases blood pressure and acts as a neurotransmitter, DMAA, guarana (natural source of caffeine), green tea extracts (caffeine and catechins), and others! Since, overdosing on stimulants can cause grave adverse effects - it is best to exercise caution on the days you consumed a strong pre-workout; here are some foods or drinks that you need to be wary of: 1. (Black) coffee, green tea 2. Red Bull, Mountain Dew, Dr Pepper, Coke, and similar 3. Party drugs (amphetamines ‚Äòecstasy‚Äô, cocaine, similar) 4. Nootropics - modafinil, and others 5. Alcohol (evidence equivocal) 6. Cigarette smoking 7. Prescription drugs like thyronorm (avoid fat burners / pre-workouts when you have been prescribed thyroid hormones for hypothyroidism DISCLAIMER: Dr. Deepak S.

BEWARE! ...of these 'clich√© statements' that people put up all over the internet! You can't choose meditation over medication, unless you want your condition to worsen... This is especially relevant, since more and more people, it has come to my notice, are stopping their medications after reading some blog or seeing pictures like these... #Meditation, I agree, can be a part of your routine to help with mental peace and what have you, but it certainly isn't a replacement for or superior to medications especially when you are already suffering from a metabolic disorder. Imagine having an erratic blood sugar levels and then you choose mediation over insulin... that'll surely land you up in the intensive care with serious complications like hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or #diabetic #ketoacidosis (#DKA)... (PS: Sequelae of DKA are severe dehydration, impaired kidney function, coma and death!). Recommendation: 1. Stick with your medications (don't make any changes in the dosages either without consulting your physician) 2. Initiate a calorie-deficit nutrition plan (for reducing belly fat and normalising blood parameters of your disorder/s) 3.

Evidence keeps piling up against calcium supplements! Calcium and Cardiovascular Disease. Ian R. Reid, Sarah M. Bristow and Mark J. Bolland, Endorcrinology and Metabolism, 2017 Circulating calcium is a risk factor for vascular disease, a conclusion arising from prospective studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants and extending over periods of up to 30 years. These associations may be partially mediated by other cardiovascular risk factors such as circulating lipid levels, blood pressure, and body mass index, but there appears to be a residual independent effect of serum calcium. Polymorphisms of the calcium-sensing receptor associated with small elevations of serum calcium are also associated with cardiovascular disease, suggesting that calcium plays a causative role. Trials of calcium supplements in patients on dialysis and those with less severe renal failure demonstrate increased mortality and/or acceleration of vascular disease, and meta-analyses of trials in those without overt renal disease suggest a similar adverse effect. Restriction of analysis to those who are calcium-naive demonstrates a consistent adverse effect. Observational studies of dietary calcium do not demonstrate a consistent adverse effect on cardiovascular health, though very high or very low intakes may be deleterious. Thus, obtaining calcium from the diet rather than supplements is to be encouraged. MY TAKE ON THE MATTER: Given that calcium supplementation does not do what it is supposed to be doing but, on the contrary, increases health risks, the argument in favour of taking calcium pills, at this point in time ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì is not a very strong one. Blanket prescribing (by doctors) of calcium supplements for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and reduction of fracture risks, especially in the elderly (already) at risk of cardiovascular events, should therefore be STRONGLY DISCOURAGED. I have tackled this very subjective in depth here: https://drdeepakhiwale.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/stop_cal_suppl/

COMPONENTS OF TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE: Of all the components of total daily energy expenditure (#TDEE) in humans (shown below): 1. Basal metabolic rate (#BMR), 2. Thermic energy of food (#TEF), 3. Exercise-related activity thermogenesis (#EAT), and 4. Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (#NEAT) NEAT is the most variable component of energy expenditure (see pictures 1 & 2 - the infographics here show the components and % contribution of these components and which ones are more modifiable. This will come in handy for you when designing a program to increase energy expenditure: emphasizes the need to stay on your feet all day long, in addition to going to the gym) and is capable of significantly pushing up your TDEE, even more so than gym-based exercise sessions (!). This holds true even in intense exercisers (Levine JA, 2004). NEAT contribution towards TDEE can vary drastically between individuals ranging from about 15 % in very #sedentary individuals to almost 50 % of TDEE in highly-active individuals (Ravussin et al. 1986; Dauncey, 1990; Livingstone et al. 1991). Studies have demonstrated that this inter-individual variability in NEAT illustrates how two people with similar physical characteristics and caloric intake can have different #bodytypes (Villablanca PA et al., 2015. Mayo Clinic proceedings). NEAT includes energy expenditure of walking, talking, going for your job, sitting, toe-tapping, shopping, dancing, etc. Even innocuous, very low-intensity #PhysicalActivities like mastication (chewing) and fidgeting can increase energy expenditure by 20-40% above your resting metabolic rate! #ConditioningClinic #DrDee #WeightLoss #FatLoss #MetabolicDisorders prevention and management #SciencyHumour

(AS OPPOSED TO POPULAR BELIEF), LEAN, UNPROCESSED RED MEAT IS HEART-HEALTHY! Conclusions about the cardiometabolic risks of consuming red meat are historically inconsistent, with some observational studies finding a link between consumption of read meat and health risks and others not. A recently published study reconfirms that red meat is not unhealthy; on the contrary, it improves your cardiometabolic disease (CMD) parameters or risk factors (O'Connor, et al, 2018). 500g / week of red meat (if lean and unprocessed) seems to be nothing but healthy for your myocardium (heart muscle) and coronary arteries (Suppversity, June 17, 2018). Crucial to note here that weight loss seems to be the primary modifier of metabolic improvements, independent of protein source (Hill AM, et. al,  2015). #ConditioningClinic #DrDee #RedMeat #HeartDisease #Cholesterol #WeightLoss #MetabolicHealth S E R V I C E S Fat Loss | Metabolic Disorders Management | Men's Health | Women's Health | Aging-well For queries or to book a consultation, feel free to drop us a message.

This Doc is quite right... You see, rather than arguing if a low-carb, high-fat (#LCHF) diet or a #ketogenicdiet is better than or worse off compared to some other #macronutrient ratio #diet, we need to invest more effort and money in designing intervention which ensure long-term compliance towards any sort of a #caloriedeficit diet plan...

Repost: Garcinia cambogia for Fat Loss? My verdict: not worth it! I am sure you have seen advertisements (if you are in India) of this famous Bollywood actress having lost tons of weight using this amazing supplement containing G. cambogia). For those in the US, you must remember the Melissa McCarthy talking about her use of the magic pill on The Ellen Degeneres Show (http://www.fatfighterblogs.com/melissa-mccarthy-weight-los‚Ä¶/). So it is really that effective, as is claimed in the long, winding and apparently quite convincing article that goes with it? Well, here's my take on it... The weight-loss inducing ability of Garcinia cambogia HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN beyond doubt. Also, more recently, there have been concerns raised about the safety of its use for weight / fat loss (esp., on long-term use or in combination with other drugs). So, in effect, IT DOESN'T DO MUCH GOOD, BUT CAUSES HARM. In my view, CALORIE DEFICIT (EATING LESS, if you want a nice and easy term), is the best darn method to lose weight (use caffeine, if you struggle with appetite suppression). And, in any case, none of these 'weight loss pills' - Garcinia, green tea or the likes - will ever work in the absence of a calorie deficit.

As opposed to other people's hierarchical pyramid of #fatloss, mine's a bit distorted and a little different... First of, a whopping 80% or more either never realise that they are #fat (live in denial) or are in contemplation ('something needs to be done') rather than in action. Of the 20% that do decide to do something, most do not survive past the 'action phase'. Another scary statistic - that the #weightloss / #gym industry almost never talks about - is the large % of people who had previously lost weight, regain it back in 1-5 years. So, DENIAL and lack of #MOTIVATION, I reckon are the biggest hurdle to #fatloss in most people. Sort that out and you are on your way. #CalorieDeficit and #CalorieExpenditure are no doubt the foundations of the 'hierarchical pyramid' of fat loss. However, in contrast to what most people believe, a bigger chunk of calorie expenditure comes from non-exercise activity thermogenesis (#NEAT - sum total of activities #other than exercise sessions, for instance, standing all day long, fidgeting, talking animatedly, walking, etc.). Plus, NEAT is the most modifiable component of the 'components of calorie expenditure'. A typical gym-based exercise session will have an upper ceiling when it comes to calories burned per session. About #ResistanceTraining (#RT), it pales in calories expenditure in comparison to other modes of #training - #HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and #cardio. Although, RT has numerous benefits, it does precious little for direct fat loss. Also, HIIT may be a time-efficient method but the belief that it is better than cardio may be flawed. Recent study by Wewege et al, says #MICT (medium-intensity cardio training) is as good as HIIT. Last but not the least, given the grim statistics of weight regain, patient / client education, designing and implementing methods to prevent weight regain are of paramount importance...

EFFECTIVENESS OF PARACHUTES HAS NOT BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN! One of the major weaknesses of observational data is the possibility of bias, including selection bias and reporting bias. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a medical intervention justified by observational data must be in want of verification through a randomised controlled trial. Observational studies have been tainted by accusations of data dredging, confounding, and bias. For example, observational studies showed lower rates of ischaemic heart disease among women using hormone replacement therapy, and these data were interpreted as advocating hormone replacement for healthy women, women with established ischaemic heart disease, and women with risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. However, randomised controlled trials showed that hormone replacement therapy actually increased the risk of ischaemic heart disease, indicating that the apparent protective effects seen in observational studies were due to bias. Cases such as this one show that medical interventions based solely on observational data should be carefully scrutinised, and the parachute is no exception. Parachutes may reduce the risk of death and major injury after gravitational challenge. However, their effectiveness has not been conclusively proven; the basis for parachute use is purely observational! And, while parachute use is associated with adverse effects due to failure of the intervention and iatrogenic (doctor or treatment-induced)  injury, studies of free fall do not show 100% mortality. This poses a challenge for the rationale for use of  parachutes, esp. in the face of no randomised controlled trials having ever been conducted, proving the effectiveness of parachutes.

Belly Fat Could Increase Cancer Risk: Here's how... It's been well established that obesity is a contributor to #cancer risk, but how it actually causes cancer is still a question that hasn't been fully explained. 'While there have been several advances in treating cancer and improving the quality of life of patients, the number of new cases continues to surge', said Jamie Bernard, an assistant professor in pharmacology and toxicology and lead author of a Michigan State University study that offers details showing that a certain protein released from fat in the body can cause a non-cancerous cell to turn into a cancerous one. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Realizing that belly (#visceral) #fat may be contributing to cancer development assumes importance 'so we can do a better job at reducing the number of cancer cases using dietary modifications or therapeutic interventions.' PS: Visceral fat is the fat that deposits around the viscera (organs in your abdominal cavity). There is mounting evidence that is it this fat that may be causally related to the development of metabolic disorders including #overweight-#obesity, type 2 #diabetes, (some, but not al) #cardiovascular #diseases and others (cancer, even). CAUTION: Cancer - as most non-communicable diseases is likely a multi-etiology condition. And, therefore, several other factors may be have an influence on your risk of developing cancer. Having said that, '...by making smarter choices when it comes to diet and exercise and avoiding harmful habits like smoking, people can always help skew the odds in their favor'. SOURCE: Science Daily, This is how belly fat could increase your cancer risk. August 24, 2017 *The wird cancer derives it's name from the Greek word karkions meaning a crab. Cancer clings on the host like a crab and therefore, the name!

IMPROVING WOMEN‚ÄôS HEALTH - HORMONAL IMBALANCES According to estimates, a whopping 85% of women suffer from disorders arising out of hormonal imbalances: #overweight-#obesity, #diabetes, #hypothyroidism, #PCOD, to name a few! Conventional ‚Äòreplacement model of endocrinology‚Äô where the deficient hormone is supplied from the outside (a #thryoxine tab for hypothrydoism, for instance) isn‚Äôt really a solution - it doesn‚Äôt address the root cause. Also, what about the adverse effects of #medications? A well-planned #nutrition and #exercise intervention can address the root cause, reduce your need for medications and the incidence of adverse effects! Even something as innocuous looking as taking birth control pills, in addition to causing #hormonal imbalance, can deplete your blood levels of essential nutrients: zinc, magnesium,  vit. B6, and others. In this case as well, a nutritional intervention to address these #deficiencies., is the need of the hour!

Organic Beer, Recycled from Human Urine... After reading this, you'll never feel the same about beer again! Having said that, it is not a bad idea though... A brewery in Denmark is making beer using human urine. The specialty pilsner is called "Pisner," a name derived from wordplay on the type of beer and local slang. The brew is made with malting barley fertilized by the contents of urinals at the largest music festival in Northern Europe. The 50,000 liters of human waste liquid was used as an alternative to traditional animal manure or factory-made fertilizer products. 'It tastes really good', Birden Eldahl, a taster, told Reuters. 'It's fresh and full at the same time and it's a good beer', he said!

Have You Had Your Cuppa Coffee Today? Much of what coffee does to you is owing it's high caffeine content. Chemically, caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, which acts an a competitive adenosine-receptor agonist, i.e. it serves as a competition for adenosine at its receptor. This receptor is responsible for suppressing neurotransmitters like adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin. Thus, ingestion of caffeine increases the time duration of action of these stimulatory neurotransmitters. Briefly, actions of caffeine can be described as under: COGNITIVE EFFECTS Caffeine improves wakefulness and vigilance. It may be also responsible for improved skill levels, especially those acquired through repeated training (Lieberman et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl) 2002) THERMOGENIC EFFECTS Consumption of caffeine causes stimulation of metabolism and a significant increase in the production of energy (Astrup A, et al, Am J Clin Nutr 1990) ‚Äì thermogenic action of caffeine has been shown to last for almost 3 hours after ingestion. Caffeine causes mobilization of free fatty acids and fat oxidation to produce energy during exercise (Ivy JL et al., Med Sci Sports 1979, Erickson MA et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc 1987, Spriet LL, et al., Am J Physiol 1992) Additionally, it causes extra-muscular fat oxidation as well. Thus, caffeine seems to be definitely associated with causing fat loss (Erickson MA et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc 1987, Spriet LL, et al., Am J Physiol 1992). ENHANCED EXERCISE ABILITY It is believed that caffeine enhances exercise performance. This is owing to its ‚Äòglycogen-sparing effect‚Äô ‚Äì decreased utilization of muscle glycogen for energy during exercise ‚Äì fats are used instead. Thus, owing to muscles glycogen lasting longer, the setting in of fatigue is prolonged To read more: https://drdeepakhiwale.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/caffeine-things-it-does/ For individual guidance on supplementation, feel free to get in touch with me.

The Overweight-Obesity Double Whammy: #Overweight and #obesity cause adverse effects in humans on account of two basic pathogenic-etiologic (disease-causing) mechanisms: 1. SICK FAT DISEASE (SFD): Also called '#adiposopathy' by researchers (1), sick fat disease is a condition wherein fat becomes sick (diseased). This causes deranged #immune and #hormonal responses, which then form the basis of #MetabolicDisorders including #diabetes, #cardiovascular diseases, hormonal imbalances, #infertility in both, men and women and #cancer, amongst others (2). 2. FAT MASS DISEASE (FMD): The sheer weight of excess fat, a hallmark of overweight-obesity leads to mechanical problems including, but not limited to, #joint stresses, immobility, tissue friction, tissue compression which can cause high #bloodpressure, #sleepapnea, #gastrointestinal reflux and others (2); researchers call this the 'fat mass disease.' In a nutshell, obesity seems to be a 'chronic, relapsing, multi-factorial neurobehavioural disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes (both) adipose (fat) tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and #psychosocialhealth consequences' (2). TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Obesity isn't a cosmetic problem anymore but a well-recognised disease entity which causes problem on account of both deranged metabolic as well as biomechanical processes. CITATIONS: 1. Bays H.E. et al., Int J Clin Pract, 2008. 2. American Society of Bariatric Physicians' Obesity Algorithm, 2013).

#Cricket is a very unique game, which requires a very specific set of skills - both sports and #fitness related.

Therefore, it is only fair to say that nutritional and #supplementation needs for a #cricketer are also very different from other sports.

The Concept of an ‚ÄòACTIVE COUCH POTATO‚Äô and why, for most people, spending an hour at the gym in the morning may still not be enough... "In those who exercise regularly yet do not reduce sitting time (‚Äôactive couch potato‚Äô), the risk of metabolic diseases - diabetes, heart disease, cancers, others - still remains high*‚Äù - Dr. Dee, CONDITIONING CLINIC SOURCE: Owen et al., Exerc Sport Sci Rev. 2010 CONCEPT EXPLAINED (Picture 2): For a hypothetical ‚Äòphysically active‚Äô adult, a 45-minute exercise session prior to work ensures that the minimum recommended level of exercise (30 minutes per day on 5 days per week) is achieved early in the day. However, this person then sits during much of the rest of the day; he / she spends up to 95% of his waking hours sitting. However, because this person exercised for a sustained period of at least 30 minutes, current public health guidelines consider him ‚Äòphysically active‚Äô, when in actuality, the term ‚Äòactive couch potato‚Äô is  more appropriate.

Is Love-making a Good Cardiovascular Exercise? The terms '#cardiovascular / #cardiorespiratory' #exercise are misnomers, esp. if someone uses these to mean traditional #LISS (Low-Intensity, Sustained / Steady State) #endurance exercise. Because, whatever #energysystem you are using, your #heart, #bloodvessels and #respiratory system are going to be working, albeit in varying degrees depending on the modality of exercise. When it comes to #sex, while it certainly isn't a 'steady state' cardio exercise (endurance exercise) in the strictest sense of the term, it sure seems to be a great #calorie burner! For most people though, it doesn't last long... And, there-in lies the problem! 'Energy expenditure during sexual activity appears to be approximately 85 KCal (per session) or 3.6 KCal/min when performed at a moderate intensity (5.8 METS*) in young healthy men and women.' (Julie Frappier et al., 2013). Evidence is equivocal though... a Scottish researcher I knew back in day thought that love-making was a lot of huffing and puffing and didn't contribute much to calorie expenditure. Here's a great breakdown by Richard Smith, on the calorie expenditure potential of sex, depending on the intensity and type of activity... (comical piece: not to be taken seriously!) *METS: One metabolic equivalent (MET) is defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is equal to 3.5 ml O2 per kg body weight x min.

IS PROLONGED SITTING KILLING US? And, THE CONCEPT OF 'ACTIVE COUCH POTATO' (Repost from 8th Nov., 2017 because this piece of information is crucial). Whereas prolonged sitting and being an ‚Äòactive couch potato‚Äô may be putting us at risk of metabolic disorders (diabetes, heart disease, hormonal imbalances, cancer, etc), taking a break from prolonged sitting may yet, save us from these dreaded disorders; prolonged standing helps big time too! Here are some interesting observations: 1. PROLONGED SITTING: In those who spend more time sitting - watching television, traveling in a car or have ‚Äòdesk jobs‚Äô there‚Äôs a greater risk of dying of heart disease! 2. ' ACTIVE COUCH POTATO*': In those who exercise regularly, yet do not reduce siting time (‚Äòactive couch potato‚Äô), the risk of metabolic disease still remains high! 3. TAKING A BREAK: Reducing and / or breaking up prolonged occupational, transit and household sitting improves biomarkers of metabolic disease! 4. PROLONGED STANDING: Standing up involves contraction of postural muscles, stimulates enzymes that normalize triglycerides, improve HDL and glucose control *The Active Couch Potato phenomenon: Although individuals can be both sedentary and physically inactive, there‚Äôs also the potential for high sedentary time & being physically active to co-exist. An example would be an office-goer who jogs or bikes regularly, but then sits all day at a desk and spends several hours watching TV in the evening.

FOR FAT LOSS, TABATA TRAINING IS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL MODES OF TRAINING High-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs have become increasingly popular in recent years. Not only are they more efficient at burning fat during a workout (compared to steady state cardio or traditional resistance training, but also all through the day (post-workout EPOC - excess post-exercise oxygen consumption) and are quite good for improving your anaerobic fitness too... (SIT - sprint interval training - is even better at improving EPOC!  Source: Tucker WJ et al., The J Strength Cond Res., 2016). ‚ÄúTabata training,‚Äù a term that is often used synonymously with HIIT, was first described by the Japanese scientist Izumi Tabata in 1996. Tabata and his colleagues (1996) conducted a study which consisted of eight, 20-second all-out exercise bouts followed by 10 seconds of rest for a total of 4 minutes of exercise. The study found that HIIT improved aerobic capacity to a similar degree as moderate-intensity continuous training, but also resulted in a 28% increase in anaerobic capacity. Those findings led to the development of a wide variety of HIIT programs. Although there are many different ways to perform HIIT, all of the programs are characterized by periods of very heavy effort combined with periods of either complete rest or low intensity recovery (Talisa Emberts, et al., J Sports Sci Med. 2013). Tabata training has evolved to include a variety of modes and exercises performed in the classic 20-10 pattern (i.e., 20 seconds of all-out effort followed by 10 seconds of rest) (Tabata et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1996). Many protocols exist (with different exercises and different times frames); you can design your own too. To help you with Tabata workouts, you can... Either 1. Download Tabata apps from iTunes or Google Play; these give beeps to keep your posted of the time (rather than you needing to keep an eye on the watch or the clock all the time), Or 2. Download Tabata songs. http://tabatasongs.com/ is a great resource to do so!

PLEASE NOTE... Compared to exercising 'on and off', a lifetime of regular exercise seems to be more helpful; it not only keeps you health but young as well.

Garcinia cambogia for Fat Loss? My verdict: not worth it! I am sure you have seen advertisements (if you are in India) of this famous Bollywood actress having lost tons of weight using this amazing supplement containing G. cambogia). For those in the US, you must remember the Melissa McCarthy talking about her use of the magic pill on The Ellen Degeneres Show (http://www.fatfighterblogs.com/melissa-mccarthy-weight-los‚Ä¶/). So it is really that effective, as is claimed in the long, winding and apparently quite convincing article that goes with it? Well, here's my take on it... The weight-loss inducing ability of Garcinia cambogia HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN beyond doubt. Also, more recently, there have been concerns raised about the safety of its use for weight / fat loss (esp., on long-term use or in combination with other drugs). So, in effect, IT DOESN'T DO MUCH, BUT CAUSES HARM. In my view, CALORIE DEFICIT (EATING LESS, if you want a nice and easy term), is the best darn method to lose weight (use caffeine, if you struggle with appetite suppression). And, in any case, none of these 'weight loss pills' - Garcinia, green tea or the likes - will ever work in the absence of a calorie deficit.

'LATE NIGHTS' MAY CAUSE OBESITY! Although, it is well-known that a 'deranged energy equation' is to blame for the overweight-obesity epidemic, additional risk factors constantly keep emerging. ALAN (artificial light-at-night) is one such. Disruption of the body's normal biological clock (circadian rhythm) and suppression of nocturnal melatonin production are some of the suggested mechanisms. Well-established adverse effects of ALAN emitted by residential areas, road illumination and non-stop economic activities are lack of sleep quality (which is itself causes hormone disruption), insomnia, increased alertness, depression, and elevated risk of hormone-dependent cancers: prostate and breast! In a nutshell, increased exposure to artificial light-at-night may increase risk of obesity. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: (like you mum said...) be off to bed early! SOURCE: Rybnikova, Haim and Portnov.

ATTENTION: Your Prime Health Goal Should Be To Lower Body Fat % INTRO: Just lowering your #BloodSugar or cholesterol and #triglycerides through the use of drugs, isn't going to solve the root cause of the #metabolicdisease you suffer from. You need to lose #bodyfat (%) to really reverse the condition. (...call me vain, for this picture, but) Veins popping out are a sign of low body fat. More the (visibility of the) #subcutaneous #vascularity (blood vessels), lesser the body fat under the skin (subcutaneous). The good news is, subcutaneous body fat matches up quite well with overall body fat %. And we all know that a low body fat (especially #visceral - #abdominal) augurs well, as far as keeping metabolic disorders at bay is concerned. Also, given that much of the non-communicable #diseases (#NCDs) like #diabetes, most #heartdiseases and others spring from abdominal #obesity, it makes sense to focus more on reducing body fat % rather than just looking to lower your blood sugar or cholesterol and triglycerides through the use of drugs! Furthermore, prominent veins, in all likelihood, also means more #leanmass and, #anaerobic and #cardio-#respiratory #fitness too. PS: Women would shudder to get too vascular (and, understandably so). Do not fret, the normal range of body fat% for women is 12-24%, at which range, you won't be getting too vascular. In men, the range is 14-17%. For the athletic population, the numbers are 6-13% (M) and 14-20% (W). #DrDee #CONDITIONINGCLINIC

Beta-alanine has indirect ergogenic properties - it  acts as a precursor in #carnosine synthesis. There‚Äôs a need to supplement with #BetaAlanine because carnosine cannot be supplemented with directly since it is destroyed by the enzyme carnosinase present in human blood. Beta-alanine #supplementation elevates muscle carnosine, and therefore, improves high-intensity exercise performance and/or enhances the quality of training in strength-power sports. beta-alanine - by virtue of its conversion to #carnosine - helps in both #exercise performance and muscle #recovery, by acting as: 1. A Proton #Buffer, and 2. As an #Antioxidant SOURCE: Trexler ET et al., JISSN, 2015 For beta-alanine dosing regimen, please see accompanying illustrations.

Furthermore, it is surprisingly free of adverse side effects! However, *BPC (Body Protecting Compound) is not patent-able, and thus, not of interest to pharmaceutical companies.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST: Testosterone Supplementation Produces Truthfulness in Men! It is indeed sad that #testosterone ‚Äì especially when used as a steroidal #supplement ‚Äì has been maligned beyond belief.

The truth of the matter is that T can, in fact, have positive social influence on the behaviour of men and even produces truthfulness.

REPOST: ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! SYMPTOMS OF 'MALE MENOPAUSE‚Äô UNZIPPED (Pun unintended)! Scientists have identified symptoms associated with what is termed late-onset #hypogonadism or #MaleMenopause*; it is caused by the age-associated decline in #testosterone production in men. But researchers say that unlike the female menopause, which affects all women, the male menopause is relatively rare, affecting only 2% of elderly men, and is often linked to poor general health and #obesity. Associated symptoms are: SEXUAL SYMPTOMS: 1.Decreased frequency of #MorningErections 2. Decreased sexual thoughts (#SexDrive / #libido) 3. #ErectileDysfunction** (#ED) PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS: 1. Inability to engage in vigorous activity, running or lifting heavy objects 2. Inability to walk more than 1km, and 3. Inability to bend, kneel or stoop PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS: Lethargy (loss of or low energy), sadness, & fatigue; these non-sexual symptoms are only weakly related to low testosterone. *Presence of all three sexual symptoms, together with low blood testosterone levels, is required to establish a diagnosis. **Inability to get or hold an erection SOURCES: 1.

SUNLIGHT & VIT. D PILLS MAY REDUCE THE RISK OF TYPE 1 DIABETES IN CHILDREN BACKGROUND: 80-90% of #VitaminD present within the human body originates from skin synthesis where #sunlight activation plays a key role. As opposed to popular belief, vitamin D is a 'master #hormone', not just a #vitamin per se ‚Äì has multi-system functions; few of these are: 1. Calcium-bone metabolism 2. Nerve impulse generation & conduction 3. Muscle, heart, pancreas and endocrine organs functioning 4. Immune system strengthening 5. Cancer prevention ‚Äì lung, colon, and breast, to name a few VITAMIN D AND DIABETES: Scientists have demonstrated a high prevalence of low vitamin D levels in both - adults with type 2 and in children with type 1 diabetes! With this backdrop, it is advisable (especially, in children) to soak up some sunlight and get in vit. D supplements (if not too much sunlight available - higher latitudes) to keep your blood levels of vitamin D in top shape and therefore reduce the risk of diabetes - type 1 in children and type 2 in young and elderly adults. SOURCE: M. Nathaniel Mead, Environ Health Perspect., 2008 [PMC2290997] PS: Having said that, it is not clear whether this is a cause of the disease or an effect of another causative factor‚Äîfor example, lower levels of physical activity (in this case, outdoor activity in particular).

Dear Indians, Not only are 'good morning WhatsApp messages with random floral or quotes pictures' a source of annoyance but also amount to encroaching upon personal space. If you do not have anything concrete to say, you are better off not sending any messages - that WILL turn the person's morning into a good one indeed! Plus, the staggering amount of good morning texting that Indians indulge in,  between just before sunrise and up until 8 am, is slowing down the world!

There's a silent epidemic of polycystic ovarian syndrome or disease (PCOS / PCOD) raging on all around the world. Even in India, it is an emerging condition, especially in adolescent girls living in urban areas (Beena Joshi et al., 2014). Although, not strictly associated with or caused by obesity (as evidenced by the large proportion of cases in the 'thin' population), an exercise and nutritional intervention may help, through correction of hormonal imbalance (see infographic).

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! DIABETES STARTS MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE IT IS DIAGNOSED! Every time someone is diagnosed with diabetes, there is, typically, a sense of disbelief! However, did you know that your pancreas has been waging a losing battle against wrong food choices for an estimated 12 years*(!), before your diabetes is diagnosed?! The beta-cells of pancreas - responsible for insulin secretion - go through different stages of worsening dysfunction over years. However, since the patient is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms and signs present), diabetes is difficult to diagnose clinically. The earliest sign of something being wrong is insulin resistance. And, thus, prevention and reversal of diabetes should ideally focus on the earliest point of dysfunction, which is insulin resistance. Unfortunately, because clinicians focus on blood sugar and not insulin as a standard test, crucial years are lost and treatment typically begins when the proverbial ‚Äòhorses have bolted‚Äô, making reversal difficult! TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Typically, diabetes type 2 is diagnosed around 40 years of age. In India, this age is even younger. So, ideally, you need to start worrying about diabetes as you approach your 30s; get your insulin levels and insulin resistance checked *SOURCE: Vivian A.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST: STOP USING CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS, NOW! (REPOST) Contrary to popular belief, there is consistent lack of evidence for the effectiveness of calcium supplementation (for reducing fracture risk). Plus, use of calcium tablets may be harmful - is strongly associated with cardiovascular events (atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction), other adverse effects (renal calculi) and increased risk of death. Increasing calcium intake through food, on the other hand, seems to be both safe and effective! Please have a look at the accompanying infographic on some of the calcium-rich foods and their calcium content!

HEALTH WARNING: Be Wary of Green Tea; here's why! Food‚Äìdrug interactions play an important role in the alteration of the actions of drugs inside the human body. Due to these interactions, an increase or decrease in the efficacy of a drug may be observed which may eventually lead to serious clinical consequences. A considerable number of recent publications has addressed interactions between natural herbal products and drugs. In addition, there are several reports indicating an effect of food components, such as grapefruit juice, orange juice, green tea extract and others on drug absorption. One of the most popular and commonly consumed beverages is green tea (Camellia sinensis); it is basically used for its (alleged) health benefits: 1. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer effects, and... 2. As a weight loss aid However, consumption of green tea during early pregnancy can be detrimental - catechin, one of the antioxidants present in green tea can reduce folic acid* (folate) absorption, thereby increasing the risk of birth defects (Alemdaroglu et al., 2008)! Low blood folate level may also cause other health problems: megaloblastic anaemia, growth retardation, hyperhomocysteinaemia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers, amongst others. Plus,  maternal tea consumption has been formerly shown to be linked to having an increased risk of anencephaly and spina bifida (Correa A et al. Ann Epidemiol 2000). *that folic acid supplementation during early pregnancy and prevents birth defects is well established in scientific literature. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Avoid green tea, especially during early pregnancy (first trimester or the first 3 months), particularly in high doses!

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! SYMPTOMS OF 'MALE MENOPAUSE‚Äô UNZIPPED (Pun unintended)! Scientists have identified symptoms associated with what is termed late-onset #hypogonadism or #MaleMenopause*; it is caused by the age-associated decline in #testosterone production in men. But researchers say that unlike the female menopause, which affects all women, the male menopause is relatively rare, affecting only 2% of elderly men, and is often linked to poor general health and #obesity. Associated symptoms are: SEXUAL SYMPTOMS: 1.Decreased frequency of #MorningErections 2. Decreased sexual thoughts (#SexDrive / #libido) 3. #ErectileDysfunction** (#ED) PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS 1. Inability to engage in vigorous activity, running or lifting heavy objects 2. Inability to walk more than 1km, and 3. Inability to bend, kneel or stoop PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS: Lethargy (loss of or low energy), sadness, & fatigue; these non-sexual symptoms are only weakly related to low testosterone. *Presence of all three sexual symptoms, together with low blood testosterone levels, is required to establish a diagnosis. **Inability to get or hold an erection SOURCES: 1.

When Athletes turn Sports Nutritionists: MS Dhoni's Tom Brady moment... üòâüòÇüòÇ While the world runs away with lightening fast progress in the fields of sports medicine, sports science and sports performance and recovery nutrition, this is the kind of lousy advice that our cricketers dish out to their juniors. LOL... And, to think that the Indian cricket board and cricketers are the some of richest athletes in the world. üòèüòéüòé #BCCI Imagine for a moment, that I came out with a book on how to win the world cup (of cricket), I'd be a laughing stock! However, the other way around is - most often than not - allowed. People in the fitness - sports world are allowed to dispense unscientific and sometimes, downright wrong advice on nutrition. Keith Baar, a researcher of muscle physiology at the University of California, says, 'everyone thinks that they are an expert in fitness if they are fit.' Well, ain't that the truth?! Interesting to note here that if you happen to don a visible set of six-pack abdominals, you are on your way.. whatever you say, will be taken as gospel... In effect, Dhoni says here that you can eat anything - provided it is during the first half of the day! According to him, 'burning it off' is all that matters! Whatever happened to the nutrients you need (as a sports person) to perform and to recover?! I feel sorry for gullible fans of his, who also happen to be budding cricketers and therefore, likely to slurp up every piece of (such!) advice that he dishes out...

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! DIABETES STARTS MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE IT IS DIAGNOSED! Every time someone is diagnosed with diabetes, there is, typically, a sense of disbelief! However, did you know that your pancreas has been waging a losing battle against wrong food choices for an estimated 12 years*(!), before your diabetes is diagnosed?! The beta-cells of pancreas - responsible for insulin secretion - go through different stages of worsening dysfunction over years. However, since the patient is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms and signs present), diabetes is difficult to diagnose clinically. The earliest sign of something being wrong is insulin resistance. And, thus, prevention and reversal of diabetes should ideally focus on the earliest point of dysfunction, which is insulin resistance. Unfortunately, because clinicians focus on blood sugar and not insulin as a standard test, crucial years are lost and treatment typically begins when the proverbial ‚Äòhorses have bolted‚Äô, making reversal difficult! TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Typically, diabetes type 2 is diagnosed around 40 years of age. In India, this age is even younger. So, ideally, you need to start worrying about diabetes as you approach your 30s; get your insulin levels and insulin resistance checked *SOURCE: Vivian A.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST Before you Buy that Bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar, Read This: The Great Apple Cider Vinegar SCAM: Things ACV doesn‚Äôt do! Contrary to the popular perception that ingesting ACV on a regular basis provides health benefits, there seems to be little scientific evidence in favour of the alleged health benefits of apple cider vinegar (see illustration). Furthermore ‚Äì although ACV is considered safe when consumed in reasonable amounts ‚Äì ACV in large amounts or when used on a longer-term basis, either alone or in combination with particular medications, can cause health issues. So, is there any basis for the alleged health benefits of ACV. Well, let us have a look at some of the health benefits people usually associate ACV with and whether there indeed is any proof of the benefits of ingesting ACV.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! SYMPTOMS OF 'MALE MENOPAUSE‚Äô UNZIPPED (Pun unintended)! Scientists have identified symptoms associated with what is termed late-onset #hypogonadism or #MaleMenopause*; it is caused by the age-associated decline in #testosterone production in men. But researchers say that unlike the female menopause, which affects all women, the male menopause is relatively rare, affecting only 2% of elderly men, and is often linked to poor general health and #obesity. Associated symptoms are: SEXUAL SYMPTOMS: 1.Decreased frequency of #MorningErections 2. Decreased sexual thoughts (#SexDrive / #libido) 3. #ErectileDysfunction** (#ED) PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS 1. Inability to engage in vigorous activity, running or lifting heavy objects 2. Inability to walk more than 1km, and 3. Inability to bend, kneel or stoop PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS: Lethargy (loss of or low energy), sadness, & fatigue; these non-sexual symptoms are only weakly related to low testosterone. *Presence of all three sexual symptoms, together with low blood testosterone levels, is required to establish a diagnosis. **Inability to get or hold an erection SOURCES: 1.

BPC 157 MAY PRECLUDE THE NEED FOR JOINT SURGERY CONTEXT: Recently, I was contacted by someone on behalf of a 30ish year old lady patient, who had suffered a grade 2 #ACL (#AnteriorCruciateLigament of the knee) injury, while squatting at the gym in Pune that claims to specialise in functional training... I was shocked when the person wanted to know what the dose of #HGH (human growth hormone) for her should be. (FYI, evidence is equivocal, as far as the effectiveness HGH for ligament / tendon repair). But, given the adverse effects profile of growth hormone, wonder why anyone would want to opt for HGH as the first option... This is what happens when you believe in your ignorant personal trainer/s more than the ability of doctors to repair a torn ligament. Anyway, here's a brilliant option (use of BPC 157) if you are looking for an alternative to surgery or to hasten post-surgical recovery (crucial in athletes). #BPC157, a pentadecapeptide, can accelerate tendon, ligament, bone and muscle repair. Furthermore, it is surprisingly free of side effects! However, *BPC (Body Protecting Compound) is not patent-able, and thus, not of interest to pharmaceutical companies. And, that is why you or your doctor will have, probably, never heard of it! This is what BPC 157 does (have a look at the infographic).

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST Careful, when you are using a powerful pre-workout or a fat burner, esp. over the weekend... Pre-workout, ‚Äòthermogenic‚Äô supplements will typically contain a cocktail of ingredients which work by stimulating the adrenergic system - caffeine (the main ingredient), synerphrine (ephedrine alternative), yerba mate (contains 3 stimulant xanthines - caffeine, theobromine, theophylline), yohimbine (stimulant and aphrodisiac), tyramine (monoamine derived from tyrosine, acts as a catecholamine (dopamine, NE, Epi) releasing agent - increases blood pressure and acts as a neurotransmitter, DMAA, guarana (natural source of caffeine), green tea extracts (caffeine and catechins), and others! Since, overdosing on stimulants can cause grave adverse effects - it is best to exercise caution on the days you consumed a strong pre-workout; here are some foods or drinks that you need to be wary of: 1. (Black) coffee, green tea 2. Red Bull, Mountain Dew, Dr Pepper, Coke, and similar 3. Party drugs (amphetamines ‚Äòecstasy‚Äô, cocaine, similar) 4. Nootropics - modafinil, and others 5.

HIMALAYAN PINK SALT OR IODISED TABLE SALT, WHICH IS HEALTHIER? Let's have a look. HIMALAYAN ROCK (PINK) SALT: Is a type of #RockSalt mined in Pakistan. It is rich in calcium, potassium, magnesium; also contains trace amounts of zinc, lead, chromium and copper. These micro elements are the reason for the alleged health benefits of switching over to #Himalayansalt. It, however, contains insignificant amounts (or lacks) of iodine. IODIZED TABLE SALT: Is a sodium salt (NaCl) fortified with iodine. It lacks the trace elements that #PinkSalt is rich in, but you could very well do with the iodine - especially if you live in geographical areas that are endemic for #hypothyroidism. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: So, although it's rich in minerals crucial for optimal health, switching over completely to Himalayan pink salt - because of lack of iodine in it - may undermine your #thyroidhealth. This becomes doubly important if you happen to live in a geographic area endemic for #hypothyroid #goitre (the Indian subcontinent). Best strategy is to use equal portions of iodized table and #HimalayanPinkSalt in your food; this will ensure sufficient amounts of both iodine and important other minerals. #DrDee, #CONDITIONINGCLINIC #MetabolicDisorders #ThyroidHealth #Hypothyroidism #ThyroidStatus #TSH #ThyroidHormones #FatLoss #Obesity #Overweight #Nutrition #BodyComposition

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! Vitamin D deficiency in Early Pregnancy May Cause Kids to Grow Fat in Later Life! Vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy may preprogram babies to grow into obese children and adults. 6-year-olds born to mothers with low vit. D levels during their early pregnancies had bigger waists - half an inch plumper on an average - and 2 percent more body fat, than peers whose mothers had enough vit. D levels! TAKE HOME MESSAGE: CONDITIONING CLINIC recommends* daily sunlight exposure, ingestion of vit. D-rich foods & vit. D supplements during pregnancy; these might help stem childhood obesity. CAUTION: Too much vit. D can cause damage to the heart, blood vessels and the kidneys! Although there is no set recommended daily intake of vitamin D, many agree the dietary intake of the vitamin should increase with age. The Institute of Medicine of The National Academies recommends that females 1 to 70 years old consume 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily, regardless of their pregnancy status. The group sets tolerable maximum levels at 4,000 IU (100 micrograms) for pregnant and non-pregnant women who are 19 and older. Lower levels are advised based on age. SOURCE: V. Daraki, et al.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! Holding hands can sync brainwaves, ease pain! Scientists have long known that people subconsciously sync their footsteps with the person they're walking with or adjust their posture to mirror a friend's during conversation. Recent studies also show that when people watch an emotional movie or sing together, their heart rates and respiratory rhythms synchronize. When leaders and followers have a good rapport, their brainwaves fall into a similar pattern. And when romantic couples are simply in each other's presence, their cardiorespiratory and brainwave patterns sync up, research has shown. The new study - quoted here - is the first to explore interpersonal synchronization in the context of pain and touch. Reach for the hand of a loved one in pain and not only will your breathing and heart rate synchronize with theirs, your brain wave patterns will couple up too, according to a study published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). ‚ÄòInterpersonal touch may blur the borders between self and other,‚Äô the researchers wrote. It could be that touch is a tool for communicating empathy, resulting in an analgesic, or pain-killing, effect! Sources: 1. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170621125313.htm 2.

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! DIABETES STARTS MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE IT IS DIAGNOSED! Every time someone is diagnosed with diabetes, there is, typically, a sense of disbelief! However, did you know that your pancreas has been waging a losing battle against wrong food choices for an estimated 12 years*(!), before your diabetes is diagnosed?! The beta-cells of pancreas - responsible for insulin secretion - go through different stages of worsening dysfunction over years. However, since the patient is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms and signs present), diabetes is difficult to diagnose clinically. The earliest sign of something being wrong is insulin resistance. And, thus, prevention and reversal of diabetes should ideally focus on the earliest point of dysfunction, which is insulin resistance. Unfortunately, because clinicians focus on blood sugar and not insulin as a standard test, crucial years are lost and treatment typically begins when the proverbial ‚Äòhorses have bolted‚Äô, making reversal difficult! TAKE HOME MESSAGE Typically, diabetes type 2 is diagnosed around 40 years of age. In India, this age is even younger. So, ideally, you need to start worrying about diabetes as you approach your 30s; get your insulin levels and insulin resistance checked *SOURCE: Vivian A. Fonseca | Diabetes Care. 2009

RANT: Personal Trainers and the Proverbial Bubble that they Live in! I find it quite amusing to see personal trainer throw around a few anatomical terms to impress upon their (potential) client, that they are well versed in their trade. While that is OK, it becomes annoying when a personal trainer claims to be an expert in anatomy or a similar subject. I was once speaking with a trainer / tutor for some fitness course (I wouldn't wanna name names or you'd know I am talking about Chaitanya Velhal from MultiFit in Pune, India), and he says, 'I specialize in anatomy' or something along those lines! Needless to say, I was shocked... I was so tempted to test his anatomy by asking a simple thing like the boundaries of the 'anatomical snuff box' - which a med student learns within the first few weeks of his med school education. I wonder how and why personal trainers think they know anatomy inside-out if they learn the name of a few muscles (biceps / triceps brachii, latissimus dorsi, quadriceps femoris and erector spinae are few of the PTs' favourite muscle names to throw about). Well, let me tell you my pedigree champs, names of muscles is not even the tips of the anatomical iceberg! Even in muscles, I'd be impressed if you can name the muscles of the forearm or those in the palm... Mind you, muscle names are the easiest bit - there are attachments of the muscles (origin and insertion), nerve-blood supply, bones and ossification centres, and a million other things. Also, wait till you reach the head, neck and face and the cranial cavities. Try and rattle off names of the bones of the skull. Then, I would be tempted to believe you are kinda good at anatomy. Similar is the case with physiology and biochemistry. Pretense of personal trainers that they know these subjects too, simply gets under my ticks! But then, such is the world that we live in... You don six-pack abdominals and you have 3 million idiots watching your YouTube video and asking you advice about metabolic disorders! PS: picture that goes with this post of the arteries of the head, neck and the base of the brain and the abdomen and pelvis, some of the easiest of the anatomical mumbo-jumbo!

ISSUED IN PUBLIC INTEREST! IS PROLONGED SITTING KILLING US? Whereas prolonged sitting and being an ‚Äòactive couch potato‚Äô may be putting us at risk of metabolic disorders (diabetes, heart disease, hormonal imbalances, cancer, etc), taking a break from prolonged sitting may yet, save us from these dreaded disorders; prolonged standing helps big time too! Here are some interesting observations: 1. PROLONGED SITTING: In those who spend more time sitting - watching television, traveling in a car or have ‚Äòdesk jobs‚Äô there‚Äôs a greater risk of dying of heart disease! 2. ' ACTIVE COUCH POTATO*': In those who exercise regularly, yet do not reduce siting time (‚Äòactive couch potato‚Äô), the risk of metabolic disease still remains high! 3. TAKING A BREAK: Reducing and / or breaking up prolonged occupational, transit and household sitting improves biomarkers of metabolic disease! 4. PROLONGED STANDING: Standing up  involves contraction of postural muscles, stimulates enzymes that normalize triglycerides, improve HDL and glucose control *The Active Couch Potato phenomenon: Although individuals can be both sedentary and physically inactive, there‚Äôs also the potential for high sedentary time & being physically active to co-exist. An example would be an office-goer who jogs or bikes regularly, but then sits all day at a desk and spends several hours watching TV in the evening.
