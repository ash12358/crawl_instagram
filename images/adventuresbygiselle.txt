SO excited to share a photo essay/article I created in collaboration with @nations from one of my latest expeditions around the world with @natgeoexpeditions! On this expedition I asked a single question in every country I visited; ‚ÄúWhere do you find beauty in your everyday life?‚Äù and the thoughtful responses I received in each interview consistently touched my heart. If you‚Äôre curious about different cultures and their take on beauty from around the world, check out the link in my bio to see the whole thing!

Paris, just Paris. Need I say more? This city fills my heart, enriches my mind, and reminds my soul to dance! #AdventuresByGiselle

For me, traveling isn‚Äôt worthwhile purely for the novelty of new places and activities. Rather, it‚Äôs the people I meet in all corners of the world who make my travels so rich! With each smile and conversation (and let‚Äôs be honest, a ridiculous number of selfies), the world becomes a little bit smaller and my international family grows a little bit larger. Reflecting on my latest trip across Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East I am so thankful for all the people I encountered along the way! Next stop? London and Paris! #AdventuresByGiselle #TCSWorldTravel #TCSMoments

In Kyrgyzstan the eagle and the hunter still depend on one another to survive and thrive, just as they‚Äôve done for hundreds of years. So the opportunity to watch this eagle hunter with his bird was mesmerizing (and insanely fun to photograph)! #AdventuresByGiselle #TCSWorldTravel

In rain or shine, Lisbon sparkles as a true gem of Europe! It‚Äôs one of the few countries I‚Äôve visited that has found a way to seamlessly merge the old and new in a beautiful seaside city that is practically poetic. It was also the first stop on my current expedition, to journey from Europe to the Middle East and then back again. Follow along for the full adventure! #TCSWorldTravel #AdventuresByGiselle

UPDATE #3! It‚Äôs about time for another adventure! In just a few days I‚Äôll be heading to Lisbon, Portugal to start an expedition across Eurasia on an itinerary that has me like: üòç! Over the next few weeks I‚Äôll be traveling through Portugal, Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Oman, Albania, Romania, and Spain, before returning to Lisbon. (Whew!) One of the destinations I‚Äôm most looking forward to is Iran, yet it is also the one that raises the most eyebrows, as only about 1,500 American travelers visit per year. Yes, there is a long and difficult political history between our two countries. However, I think there is a great deal that American and Iranian people can learn from one another, and I have a feeling that we‚Äôd be surprised by how many commonalities we share. So here‚Äôs a request for you! If you could ask an Iranian citizen one question, what would you ask? I‚Äôll be asking the people I meet your questions and I‚Äôll have them do the same with questions for you. So brainstorm what you would ask and leave it in a comment below! #AdventuresByGiselle

UPDATE #2! Just days after the Royal Wedding this May, I‚Äôll be flying to London to begin my 2018 season with Adventures by Disney working in.... ENGLAND and  FRANCE! I‚Äôll be prancing through London and Paris all summer, waving like the queen and eating my weight in croissants‚Äîand I absolutely can‚Äôt wait. If you‚Äôll be in either of those cities this summer, send me a message and let‚Äôs see if we can meet up! And if you love these cities as much as I do, leave a comment with your favorite hidden gem (10 extra points if it‚Äôs a cafe or bookshop)! Check back on Friday for update #3! #AdventuresByGiselle

Hey friends! Today is the first of a week full of exciting announcements/updates I want to share with you all! UPDATE #1! This fall I received my ‚ÄúHogwarts letter" from the school of my dreams, the University of Edinburgh, with their Business School's top scholarship to pursue a masters degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation! Where is that, you ask? SCOTLAND! (That's where I took a photo with this little cutie while visiting the university.) After a great deal of careful consideration, I decided a few months ago to accept and I will be moving to Edinburgh, Scotland at the end of this summer for a year to kick some butt in GRADUATE SCHOOL! From the powerful ways I have seen business harnessed in communities around the world as a tool to enact change, to the work I've done to help existing businesses and nonprofits find better ways to tell their stories internationally, there are so many ways this degree fits my passions and aspirations. I get giddy when I think of all the ways I will learn and grow through this program! I will continue my work within the travel industry, but will take a break from most extended trips once the program starts, until I finish the following year. If you know friends in Scotland or if you're gonna be traveling there sometime next year, reach out and let's see if we can connect in Edinburgh! That's all for today, so check back on Wednesday for another update! üòâ #AdventuresByGiselle

#lategram from snorkeling and scuba diving in Australia‚Äôs Great Barrier Reef a few weeks ago! This time ‚Äòround I learned how to keep my cool while swimming with a shark and that underwater photos with goggles usually make you look anything BUT cool (go ahead and zoom in on that first one). üòâü¶à #AdventuresByGiselle #natgeoexpeditions

We sailed out on wooden longboats at sunrise in a remote part of Myanmar (Burma) to see the traditional fishermen of Inle Lake‚Äîand in the pink light of dawn I could have sworn there was magic in the air. #natgeoexpeditions #AdventuresByGiselle

It‚Äôs all about the details. You know how every time you watch your favorite movie, you become more aware of the little touches that make it great? I think it‚Äôs the same with travel. Today marks the start of another adventure around the world and I can‚Äôt wait to see what I‚Äôll discover upon returning to the places and people I‚Äôve grown to love! üó∫‚úàÔ∏èüíÉüèº#natgeoexpeditions

Ten points if you can guess where in the world this picture was taken! üßê In just two weeks I‚Äôll be starting another adventure around the world with @natgeo, so I figured I‚Äôd share some of my favorite images from the expedition a few months ago. #AdventuresByGiselle

Merry Christmas, everyone! Though I‚Äôm in Laos and on the other side of the world from friends and family, today I was able to marvel at the splendor of the world we live in. What a gift it is to live each day as an awfully big adventure, and what a joy to know that the God who crafted this masterpiece is able to shape my story as well (...and yours)! #nofilter #noreally #legitnofilter #iknowright

I am constantly in awe of how beauty can be found in so many difference places in faces. I took both of these images within about a minute of one another while visiting and meeting the man who runs the boiler room of a local hammam, or Turkish bathhouse, on a recent trip to Marrakech, Morocco.

Who knew the desert could be so cool? It's been on my good side ever since I saw one of the most glorious desert sunsets in Joshua Tree National Park and watched the milky way come out... and then when @_lorrainemae_ and I low key got stalked by a coyote after climbing around on some boulders. üòÖüëå #AdventuresByGiselle

Today I am thankful for soulful and laughter-filled friendships! I've been in California for the last few days with these incredible humans and yesterday was truly the icing on the cake as we surfed (well they surfed, I repeatedly wiped out) alongside pods of dolphins until the sun set! To all my sweet adventure-loving friends... Happy Thanksgiving!! #AdventuresByGiselle

Today I have been swept up in awe, reflecting on the stories I encountered during this month of travel. From the roof of the world in Tibet to the cradle of mankind in Tanzania--stories I could have never thought of on my own, some that are truly stranger than fiction, are all around us and being lived in endlessly creative ways. What a joy and honor to experience, hear, and share them. #natgeoexpeditions #AdventuresByGiselle

"Camels, and donkeys, and wifi! Wait, what?" Yet again, Petra tops the charts as one of my favorite places in the world. I love its rich history and culture, but most importantly I adore the incredible Jordanian Beduins I now call friends. #natgeoexpeditions #AdventuresByGiselle

Picture this: you arrive after dark at a mystery location in Angkor Wat and are welcomed with Cambodian music and dancers lit by torches. Then you walk down a lantern-lit path to an open area with hundreds of lanterns glowing in the dark on a hill before you. Suddenly the music swells and studio lights come on to reveal a massive temple, decorated with traditional dancers in its doorways. Pretty darn cool, right? This was one of the few instances when I've felt I truly transported back in time! #natgeoexpeditions #AdventuresByGiselle

I am all about that rainforest life in Australia. Yesterday we tasted exotic fruits I never knew existed from all around the world, including an incredible little red berry called "Miracle Fruit." With one bite, it coats your tastebuds so that everything you eat afterwards (including lemons) tastes deliciously sweet! #NatGeoExpeditions #AdventuresByGiselle

While traveling around the world I am asking people from each country the same question, "Where do you find beauty in your everyday life?" and the answers I've received have been fascinating. Today, for example, I walked around Machu Picchu with an old man who lives at the base of the mountain and heard how he finds beauty from days studying the site and learning to live harmoniously with nature from the Incas who built it. If you could ask the  world one question, what would you ask? #NatGeoExpeditions

"Living a life fully engaged and full of whimsy and the kind of things that love does is something most people plan to do, but somewhere along the way they just kind of forget." -Bob Goff // Today I am thankful for adventure seeking friends who drive across states, wake up at the crack of dawn for hot air balloon rallies, solve mysteries on Gravity Hill, and end each day with dancing and milkshakes. You guys keep life whimsical! #AdventuresByGiselle üéà

This morning my eyes were downcast and my mind was filled with tough realities as I visited my childhood home that now belongs to another family. But this afternoon and evening it's as if God decided to pull out all the stops to lift my gaze and fill my mind with wonder. I am truly in awe and wow, is my heart at peace.

Thankful beyond belief and overflowing with stories (oh and very sleepy)--that's exactly how I feel right now as I say, "Arrivederci Italia!" Thank you @adventuresbydisney for 4 incredible months of adventure across Europe. It still amazes me that moments like this (private after-hour visits to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museum!!) can be considered part of a "usual" work day! And now... on to the next big adventure (but first... sleep)! #AdventuresByDisney

"Every day God invites us on the same kind of adventure. It's not a trip where He sends us a rigid itinerary, He simply invites us. God asks what it is He's made us to love, what it is that captures our attention, what feeds that deep indescribable need of our souls to experience the richness of the world He made. And then, leaning over us, He whispers, 'Let's go do that together.'" -Bob Goff (@bobgoff)

Edinburgh is a city that seems to have one foot firmly planted in fact, and the other in fantasy. From the cliffs of Arthur's Seat to the castle below, every inch of this city radiates whimsy and dignity, like a flower frozen in perfect bloom. Till next time, Scotland! You're the best. #AdventuresByGiselle

The past week has been such a treat! My heart has been overflowing with joy to be back in a part of the world that feels so much like home. From the Czech Republic to Germany and Austria, I'll be bouncing around this region for the rest of the month before returning to Italy.

"The soul is like a wild animal--tough, resilient, savvy, self-sufficient, and yet exceedingly shy. If we want to see a wild animal, the last thing we should do is go crashing through the woods, shouting for the creature to come out. But if we are willing to walk quietly into the woods and sit silently for an hour or two at the base of a tree, the creature we are waiting for may well emerge, and out of the corner of an eye we will catch a glimpse of the precious wilderness we seek." -Parker Palmer via #GardenCityBook

Finding the perfect hammocking spot on Mount Rainier, on top of a ridiculous amount of snow, is no easy task. But I'm happy to report that WE DID IT! Hours of swinging in the sunshine while talking and eating {almost} an entire package of Oreos made it well worth the search. #AdventuresByGiselle #lategram

"Long, blue, spiky-edged shadows crept out across the snow-fields, while a rosy glow, at first scarce discernible, gradually deepened and suffused every mountain-top, flushing the glaciers and the harsh crags above them. This was the alpenglow, to me the most impressive of all the terrestrial manifestations of God. At the touch of this divine light, the mountains seemed to kindle to a rapt, religious consciousness, and stood hushed like devout worshippers waiting to be blessed." -John Muir // So thankful for this weekend in the mountains to unplug before a busy season! #AdventuresByGiselle

Ever since I started following the narrative of refugees I have encountered stories of some of the worst in humanity, but I have also seen some of the best. Being able to read letters like these, written by high school students for local refugees (thanks to @worldreliefseattle), reminds me of our great capacity to love.

I'm currently reading a book written by my great-great-grandpa about his adventures exploring the great Canadian wilderness on a survey team to map out a route for the Trans Canadian Railroad over the Rocky Mountains--and its been pretty mind blowing. He writes about meeting the indigenous people, surviving mountain storms, fighting off grizzly bears, and even one time where he got into a fight and threw a cup of hot coffee in some guy's face (what a BA). But my favorite part is the way he talks about nature. "It is impossible to do other than stand and gaze with awe, and sigh as we are reminded of our own littleness, and turn the head for relief, and see again our pretty companions the flowers rearing their tiny heads in a waving welcome‚Ä¶" Well said great-(x3)-gramps, well said. At least now I know who I got my adventurous streak from. üòòüôå‚õ∞

#TBT to the moment I became obsessed with mint and sage tea in a Bedouin tent in Wadi Rum. I came home and immediately bought two sage and mint plants... which soon died (sadly), because apparently keeping plants alive is not one of my God given talents. #plantkiller4life #AdventuresByGiselle

2016 has been one of the most defining years of my life! This year has brought me to 24 different countries on 6 continents for more than 6 months of total travel (I'm exhausted just writing that sentence)! However, when I look back at this year I am in complete awe. I have never been so in love with/curious about our planet, nor so convinced that there are stories around the world that need to be told. With 2016 coming to a close I'm looking forward to a few months in WA before another series of travels in 2017! Thank you to everyone who has touched my life in 2016. Here's to the New Year! üéâ #AdventuresByGiselle

My thoughts have been racing and my hands have been wringing this past week in response to the devastating news coming out of Aleppo, Syria as an entire city is torn apart. Every update I get brings back a memory of the kind, brave, and heartbroken people I met along Europe's refugee route earlier this year. I see the faces of those people in my mind and I ask myself, "how and why have we been so silent about this?" Now more than ever is a time to pay attention, because what is happening right now is something I don't think history will soon forget. // In spite of, and in many cases because of their pain, there is so much we can learn from refugees and there are still so many ways we can respond. Check out the link in my bio to read the lessons I learned from the refugee route and how you can respond to the crisis in Syria NOW. #StandwithAleppo

What you don't see in this photo from scuba diving for the first time in the Great Barrier Reef: 1.) Trying to not hyperventilate for the first 5 minutes underwater (because holy crap that felt unnatural). 2.) Finally forgetting about my breathing to soak in that underwater world for the first time. 3.) Getting super giddy about petting giant sea slugs on the ocean flood. 4.) Swimming around the ledge of a massive coral formation, through schools of barracuda and hundreds of tiny colorful fish--and doing it all in total silence. // Shoutout to marine biologist extraordinaire, Tierney Thys, for appearing out of nowhere to snap this shot. üëåüèª#AdventuresByGiselle

Nearly one month, 12 countries, and 24 time zones later I am back in Washington DC after a full circumnavigation around the world with National Geographic. The soles of my shoes are worn, but my heart and soul are full from what I have experienced on this trip. In the midst of a discouraging period of U.S. history, I have been deeply encouraged by the love, kindness, and hope I consistently found in people across the globe--regardless of race, religion, or economic status. I end this expedition believing more than ever in the goodness of people, as well as the importance of speaking hope into despair, light into darkness. The world is a far more terribly beautiful place than we could imagine. So I encourage you to lift your eyes from the fear and division directly in front of you and fix your eyes on the beauty and commonality we all share. With my feet firmly planted on the ground again I will continue to choose hope, because I have seen how it is alive and well around the world, even if we can't always see it from here. Now my question to you is: will you join me? #AdventuresByGiselle

What a time to be in Morocco! The 2016 climate change conference is currently taking place in Marrakech, which means our hotel is packed with heads of state/government and secret service.

Nepal has melted my heart in all the right ways. I had one moment just before sunset to walk through the markets in Bhaktapur on my own and I could have lived in that moment forever.

"If I were asked to enumerate the pleasures of travel, this would be one of the greatest among them - that so often and so unexpectedly you meet the best in human nature, and seeing it so by surprise and often with a most improbable background, you come, with a sense of pleasant thankfulness, to realize how widely scattered in the world are goodness and courtesy and the love of immaterial things, fair blossoms found in every climate, on every soil." -Freya Stark

Yesterday was one heck of a reintroduction to the US. We went boating through the San Juan Islands and (while stalking a few whale watching boats) ended up seeing a killer whale breach for a full-on backflip directly in front of us. I could practically hear the eagles cawing in the distance, "MERICA." #AdventuresByGiselle

It's time to say so long, farewell (üé∂) to Europe (for just a bit) because I am finally back home in the States! My body is tired, but my heart is full to bursting with thankfulness for the incredible summer it has been. Thank you to every friend, new and old, who helped make this #AdventuresByDisney season an awfully big adventure. Now let the #AdventuresByGiselle continue!

"To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world." -Freya Stark (a female British explorer and travel writer from the early 1900's) // Friends, if you have never done solo travel before, let's talk. I HIGHLY recommend it. #AdventuresByGiselle

Have you ever found a place so beautiful that your heart just aches at the sheer wonder of it all? That place for me is Hallstatt. My morning today consists of lounging on the docks with endless coffee, watching fog roll out of the valley (and over the white castle on the opposite shore üòç), as swans swim past in the dozens--my heart can hardly take it, it's all so lovely! #AdventuresByGiselle #nofilterneeded

Alright guys, honesty hour. I may have the dorkiest reason ever for visiting a town... I came to Hallstatt because of a puzzle. When I was younger I randomly had a puzzle showing this view of Hallstatt that I used to put together every year--and I always told myself I'd go there. So when I woke up at 6am from the building in the middle to watch the sunrise from this view point, it felt like I was fulfilling some lifetime achievement. Puzzling for the WIN! #AdventuresByGiselle

No words can do justice to my arrival in Hallstatt today. I was completely blindsided by the beauty of this place, a sleepy town that I'm pretty sure fell out of a fairytale. Talk about a grand finale to my summer in Europe!! #AdventuresByGiselle

From Vienna to Linz, the last 24 hours have been so sweet! Earlier this winter I met a Mongolian pastor and his family while traveling in Salzburg and over 6 months later I was able to see them again and stay at their home for a night. In Austria (of all places) I ate homemade dumplings, drank suutei tea, and listened to stories about bareback horse races in the vast Mongolian countryside. THIS is why I travel. Friendships and stories like this are irreplaceable! #AdventuresByGiselle

My heart is so full it could burst! Yesterday I hopped on a train from Vienna to surprise Fusion Celje at their final (post-camp) concert in Slovenia--and it was INCREDIBLE! Words cannot express how proud I am of this group of students and leaders. Fusion, through the highs and lows in the years I have known you all, I have consistently seen you radiate God's love (and rock out while doing it). I forever know that I have family in Slovenia thanks to you beautiful people! Even though my return to Celje was brief, I would do it again in a heartbeat. Remember -- it's not goodbye. It's "se vidimo kasneje, moja dru≈æina!!" #AdventuresByFusion #FusionCelje

Today was one for the books. Thanks to a friend from Seattle, I experienced an opening night of Don Giovanni at Prague's Estate Theater! But that's not all. Once the curtains closed I was taken backstage with the cast and crew, stood where Mozart stood over 200 years ago to conduct the premiere of this exact opera, and rubbed shoulders with some Opera royalty. Tonight was such an unexpected, but truly magical gift! #AdventuresByGiselle

Need a reminder of the compassion that still exists in the world? Check out this letter to a refugee written by a homeless man in Seattle (via @seattlesugm) for the #NotForgotten campaign. Here's a snippet of what he wrote: "I know that you can and will overcome your current situation, because as we all know, if God is with you, who can be against you. And there ain't no doubt in my mind that God is with you right now and in the process of delivering you from the circumstances surrounding your lives at the moment." It goes on with encouragement and ends in, "Your friend, Johnny James." ‚ù§Ô∏è (If you're curious, many of these letters are being delivered to refugees this week in Greece!) #TSCresponse

We took backpacking to a whole new level with last night's dinner. I'm talking marinated steak, corn on the cob, jambalaya rice... AND THEN @mudged surprised us by pulling out fresh cheese, crackers, and wine that he hid in is pack for the 6 mile trek. We finished with roasted marshmallows and stories around the fire--and I'm pretty sure I died and went to heaven. #AdventuresByGiselle üèïüèû

I just did the final count and I have amazing news...This April we collected over 1,000 letters for refugees with @TheSyrianCircle!!! Think about it. That's approximately 1,000 families who will be reminded that they are loved and not forgotten. Thank you everyone who supported this initiative! We received letters from Seattle to the UK, and everywhere in between. Way to go, humans. You can be pretty cool sometimes. üòòüôåüåé #NotForgotten

Can you guess where I'm spending my summer with #AdventuresByDisney? Let me give you a hint. It's a part of the world where you'll find cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels, doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles (and singing nuns)... Guys, I'm going to CENTRAL EUROPE!!! I'll be traveling in some of my favorite countries (Austria, Germany and Czech Republic) and I could not be happier!

So pumped for this. For the month of April I‚Äôm heading an initiative through The Syrian Circle to collect letters that will be hand-delivered to refugees along Europe‚Äôs refugee route. We‚Äôre doing this to remind people who feel hopeless that they are loved, they are valued, and they are #NotForgotten. Join me in writing letters and get your own community to write letters this month! Check out @thesyriancircle and the link in my bio for more details. #TSCresponse

Reading Love Does on a beautiful Saturday morning is always a good idea. üëåüèª // "I get the invitation every morning when I wake up to actually live a life of complete engagement, a life of whimsy, a life where love does. It doesn‚Äôt come in an envelope. It‚Äôs ushered in by a sunrise, the sound of a bird, or the smell of coffee drifting lazily from the kitchen. It‚Äôs the invitation to actually live, to fully participate in this amazing life for one more day. Nobody turns down an invitation to the White House, but I‚Äôve seen plenty of people turn down and invitation to fully live." -Bob Goff (Love Does)

"Telling one‚Äôs story is more than just conveying facts‚Äîat its core, it‚Äôs a way to proclaim your humanity. And in the context of the refugee crisis where a person‚Äôs humanity is often pushed aside for political or economic reasons, storytelling becomes a bold and beautiful act of defiance." .

Looking back, this photo has become one of my favorite portraits from the entire refugee route because of the dignity and anguish captured in this one woman's face. Her expression alone tells the story of over a million refugees who have made the journey to Europe. A moment after I snapped this photo, I gestured to tell her she was beautiful and she broke into a giant grin (that I wish I could have captured)! However, what happened after this photo was something I'll never forget. While I later stood with this woman on a lower train platform looking up, a little girl around 10 years old (I think this woman's granddaughter) walked up to me and without warning she cupped my face, looked at me for a moment and said, "nice lady," before walking away. That simple moment still melts and breaks my heart at the same time. I miss these beautiful people SO much. #TheSyrianCircle #TSCresponse #NotForgotten

The more I learn about photography as a form of storytelling, the more I fall in love with it. I've been reading a book about @natgeo's women photographers on assignment and this quote from Lynn Johnson caught my attention: "I always want photographs to move people to action. That is the reason I do what I do." Whether I'm writing and taking photos in the Northwest OR on the other side of the world, that's exactly what I want to do too.

Ready to show your love for refugees? This week a small team from California will be traveling to the Greek-Macedonian border and I want to send them with hand-written letters for refugees FROM YOU! So please join me in writing letters that this team will give to some of the 13,000 currently trapped at the border. In these letters you can offer encouragement, prayers, or maybe a picture or two (recruit your kids!). We're doing this to remind refugees that they are loved, that they are not forgotten. . . üìÆ‚úâÔ∏è Please mail your letters by Monday to: PEACE Relief ATTN: Jillian 1 Saddleback Pkwy Lake Forest, CA 92630 . . üì≤‚úâÔ∏è Or you can scan/type your letter and email it by Wednesday to: jillianc@saddleback.com . Write your letters in English or ask a friend (or Google Translate) to translate your letter into Arabic, Farsi, or Pushto. Like this idea? SHARE it with your community! Encourage your family, friends, churches, schools, etc. to spend 5 minutes writing a letter that could dramatically impact a family's life. It may seem like a small gesture to you, but these letters could be treasured for many years to come. #TheSyrianCircle #NotForgotten

I'm baaaaaack and what a month it has been! From Greece to Germany our small team traveled Europe's entire refugee route and discovered the reality behind the headlines. I have an entire journal full of the stories we heard and if you haven't already, please check out @thesyriancircle on Instagram and Facebook along with my blog (seehearexplore.com) to see some what we encountered. Friends, I am full to bursting with things to say about the refugee crisis after all we experienced--so hit me up if you want to grab coffee and hear about what it's really like. My biggest request is that you don't forget about what's happening to refugees across the Middle East and Europe. These people, who I once thought of only as numbers, I now count as friends. So ask questions. Learn more. Go and serve! Just please don't forget them. #TSCresponse #TheSyrianCircle

After one full day and two nights at Neuschwanstein, I can happily say that it surpassed every single one of my expectations (and that's saying a lot).
