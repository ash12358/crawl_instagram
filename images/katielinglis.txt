I hope you’re spending some quality time either doing what you love, spending time with people you care about, or advocating for something you truly value. Happy American Independence Day y’all. . . . I’m in Georgia with my dad, working on finishing the lake house we’ve been rebuilding the last few years. Trying to contribute to the family legacy.

This is the border crossing in Big Bend that leads to the now ghost town of La Linda, Mexico. It was barricaded and closed years ago, but is easy to access and cross by wading through the Rio Grande - something I can do with little or no consequence. Today we’re seeing inexplicable news of families being separated and children detained without their parents, as they cross into the US near this bridge. I find this situation to be monstrously inhumane and barbaric. Something we can’t allow to continue unaddressed. So I’m posting this image and four numbers I called to try to make a difference. I hope you will too... . Department of Justice: 202-353-1555 Department of Homeland Security: 202-282-8495 Department of Health and Human Services: 202-205-5445 US Capitol - Reach Senators and Representatives via zip code: 202-224-3121 . Use this script as a starting point... . Hi, my name is [name] and I'm a constituent of this administration, in [city, state]. I'm calling to register my opposition to the zero-tolerance immigration policy that allows for family separation. I ask that you immediately enact a humane solution that ensures these families are treated with the dignity and respect that all humans deserve. Thank you.

Austin’s had 10 days of record high temperatures the last two weeks. Until today, no sign of rain, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that this doesn’t turn into a scorcher like the summer of 2013. #thinkrain

Busted my shoulder a week before @something_light’s annual birthday camping trip but still managed to get out on the Llano to celebrate, and damn was it worth it. Stuffed a queen sized air mattress in #TejasMerl and called it a day. Happy birthday my dear Selena, and thanks for taking care of me!

I had the pleasure of attending @designranchatx for the third year this last weekend. Made some cool stuff, including coffee and a wood spatula. But most importantly, I got some much needed nature time.

One day last October @matthewarthur told me a story about a guy he knew that painted his house one square foot at a time. He did it by hand and it only took him a few months of painting a little bit every day. I couldn’t get that story out of my head, so I decided to paint our house a little bit every week, with some help from Matt. Now, six months later, it’s finally finished. No more turquoise. It looks incredible. Thanks for the inspiration bb!

1000 times congratulations to my sweet man and the entire team behind @betterhalfbar for their official opening! Their doors have been unlocked for a week while they get accustomed to slingin biscuits and bourbons, beautiful coffees and delicious Texas fare, all day and all night. I’m so stoked this project is open, I’ll be there as often as I can...this little photo doesn’t do its beauty an ounce of justice. Head down to see for yourself - they’re open every day at 406 Walsh in Clarksville. You guys really nailed it this time!

2017 sure was a doozy, but some really great times were had too. I bought a house, spent a lot of quality time with my family @matthewarthur and @arlo_gsp, camped on the beach with my best friends, 4-wheel drove #tejasMerl through the Rocky Mountains, protested inequality, worked in Malawi, and got close to nature all over the place. Pretty much sums up this crazy year. Cheers to 2018, friends! Can’t wait to see where we’ll all go...

An impromptu road trip from Salt Lake City to Missoula with my mom and step dad has brought us here, to the Sacagawea scenic byway through the Bitterroot Mountains somewhere in Idaho. We’re going to say goodbye to my grandmother, Josephine Ann Cleary. She passed away on Saturday afternoon. A long road, mountains in the distance, and family. Could be worse.

What a phenomenal weekend! I’m grateful to have time to get out in nature and reflect on everything I’m thankful for. The last few months have been so full projects, family time, and hard work. I’ve missed being outdoors and today was filled with a lot of love and sunlight.

For a long time I’ve wanted to plant wildflowers to take over my lawn. Today that dream became a reality when we spread 300,000 native, local seeds. I’m hoping that this small measure brings my 1/10 acre closer to being bird and pollinator friendly, manages rain and runoff better, and makes the crazy shaped yard delightful for us and Arlo year round. Fingers crossed they’ll all take root!

I got to spend a long weekend in the Georgia mountains celebrating the love of my best friends with hiking, fires, dancing and golf cart races through the woods. Feeling very lucky to be surrounded with so much love and beauty in my life, this little lookout doesn't do it justice, but I was too excited to take many pictures.

There's something so magical about discovering a hot spring for the first time. Somebody put a lot of work into making this one, outside Rico Colorado, really perfect.

Camping in New Mexico is always surprisingly magical. Feels like there's so much still to explore in the land of enchantment.

Camping outside telluride feels so much like the Pacific Northwest - the whole time we chillaxed watching the the mountains Wilson, I couldn't shake the feeling We were actually in the Olympics.

Over four hours of barely-there roads that really challenged our 4x4 skills, we were ready to roll into Silverton

My lil dude chillin at the top of the world - he's really come into his own with all the mountain smells and diverse terrain.

Driving straight up single track 4x4 roads to find Carson Ghost Town was one of the most epic drives I've ever been on - photos just don't do the road or the site justice.

Middle of nowhere from Platoro to South Fork on forest road 380. Can't get enough of this altitude.

First stop in Colorado: Platoro. @matthewarthur's childhood camping zone. This time it's complete with walks along the lake, wildflower books, rolling thunder, and a bunch of humble smiles. I'm so thankful we've been able to take some time off to reset with my guy.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dccd7d9d6b95f65022fb15d6ecd05347/5BEB0688/t51.2885-15/e35/19623547_1838654883116498_9078205908936294400_n.jpg
Met up with my dad in Lake City and he was like, "50 years ago we drove up to a mining town ruins, it's only 5 miles up. We should camp up there!" So @matthewarthur took me and #tejasmerl up above tree line for the first time and we were like, "daaaaaaaamn".
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/def3258ed9c0001fd64eb0b5b597eda9/5BE4FDF4/t51.2885-15/e35/19424780_866398823507169_2538494515690340352_n.jpg

This early summer heat means our usual morning park sessions have become long evenings of enjoying the changing sky. I love these two guys and can't wait to take some time in cooler weather with them.

Over 80 hours of travel to Malawi and back and (so far) almost zero snafus. My Instagram was hacked a couple of days ago, so If you get any funky messages from me - please ignore. Sitting on 17hr flights has me really missing the simplicity and beauty of our home away from home, but I also can't wait to reach home home. One more flight to go!

Heading back to the states in the am but it doesn't feel real yet, so here's a couple of pardners in hippo sighting hijinx.

Hard work, new places, new cultures, daily travel, exciting patterns, dawn wake-up calls, birds, fresh air, wild dreams, sun and rain, missing home, green space, more hard work, teamwork, hard questions, elephants, talking it through, baobab trees, making plans. Culmination in satisfaction with the universe and a general sense of ease. Happiness.

The sun sets on our last day of project work, and damn. What a ride! Three weeks of #frogDR: 28 interviews with farmers and farming businesses in 5 regions across Malawi Over 20 hours of driving 92 hours of recorded conversation 940 recorded observations 8 recommendations One executive presentation and one very solid research report I am very proud of our efforts and so lucky to have @sarahbwe as my teammate - feels good to have done good work for a good cause. So ready for the weekend and finally a little rest!

Meller's Chameleon spotted in my future garden... These dudes are the largest chameleons in Africa! This one in particular was dark green and grey while slinking across the ground, then immediately switched to bright green and yellow in the bush - presumably to blend in with the backlight? I don't know... I don't even know if this is a male or female Chameleon! But it was big - a foot long - and it was cool. And this photo is for @katejsimpson (hbd Kate!)

If Kauai'i and Iceland had a baby... But seriously, climbing Mulanji Massif looks like a terrifying and serene climb at the same time. The locals say there are places on the mountains, notably the summit, where you can't go because there are fairy elves that kidnap people on a permanent basis. And when it rains, there aren't just waterfalls - the rocks turn shiny, streaky black with perfect streams of water, casually rolling down the cliff sides.

Found my dream home in Mulanji. Complete with double decker verandah, water buffalo skulls gracing the French doors, moss on rocks, mountain view, and Meller's Chameleon in the bushes (the largest of African chameleons!). Great spot @sarahbwe! #goals

This is what peak tea season looks like in the foothills of Mulanji Massif. Pluckers, hired by tea estates, pick leaves into their baskets and are paid by the kilo. We stopped by this collection point at lunchtime and met a few farmers - all with very strong arms and some with cut hands - while they took a break to have a sip of water, check their phones, and chat. It was visceral getting to see these hardworking people in action, in a place I'll never forget. #frogDR

Today's office. Part of #frogDR work means finding a place to think, to spread out, to get creative, and send some emails. A big part of our process is externalizing all the data we collect in the field, to make sense of it through a physical process of pattern recognition and abductive reasoning (not pictured, obvs). That takes space and lots of time. So whenever we find a good spot to concentrate, we celebrate. We got extremely lucky on this trip to find Safara House, this luxurious garden we have been calling home the last several nights. And it is filled with birds and dogs and good smells. Cheers to being the best #todaysoffice around, Safara!

Pausing Africa for a minute to throw it back to the hour before this man asked me to be his wife. I had no idea what the future would hold (still working on that!) but I knew I wanted it to always be with this man. Now I'm out here and he is my rock, my home, my favorite human. When we are together (and especially when we are apart) he pushes me to be the best version of myself and give life everything I can. Happy v-day from across a giant pond, @matthewarthur. I love you around the world a million times. Your ramblin' woman.

Day off? Let's go for a mini safari! @sarahbwe and I treated ourselves to a late afternoon game drive in Liwonde National Park, in a beautiful old Land Rover. Dressed in our safari best we bounced through pristine wild, saw 1638 Impala up close, five families of 60+ yellow baboons, innumerable Waterbuck (seen in the middle distance here) and several adorable prancing Warthogs, birds, a hippo's butt and a chipmunk. That was AFTER the Rover died in the middle of nowhere and we all got out to push-start it and BEFORE we got soaked in a massive rainstorm (pictured in the background). But most importantly we watched THREE wild elephants up close, munching on trees like we weren't even there. Mini safaris are no joke and I am officially the luckiest nature lover in the world. Now that I've had a taste I just can't wait to embark on a multi week shenanigansafari with the whole damn family!

Got up with the birds to watch the sunrise over the savannah. I could sit here for days trying to ID everything that comes up, but here are a few of my favorite discoveries: Mist rolling down the hillside and out the the river Firecrowned Bishop Red Faced Mousebird African Open Billed Stork (and its honks) Swainson's Francolin Southern Violet Woodhoope Meves' Long Tailed Starling And the trusty and familiar, magnificent and official bird of Malawi, the Fish Eagle Look one of these guys up. You won't be disappointed.

So, Baobab Tree, what's it like being a thousand years old? Having elephants graze on your trunk during drought? Always making food for the baboons?

Fell asleep at 9 last night, to the sounds of hippos grazing. Woke up with "alarm clock birds" today around 5, hoping I'd spot one of those honking hippos up close.

Made it to the weekend, which happens to look more like a dream than a reality.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/00432bc6368834ca8b38b75d56c6211e/5BE8CCFF/t51.2885-15/e35/16584785_394262207590704_8756893388273352704_n.jpg
The fishermen on Lake Malawi have the strongest canoe game I've ever seen. When a tree falls in the forest it's left in place and carved out, then portaged to the lake. The cut in the top of the canoe is too narrow to fit an adult, so the fishers sit on top to cruise the water. Each boat lasts about seven years before it starts leaking, at which point it's patched with scraps of tarpaulin, steel, rubber and finishing nails. Ingenuity!

It's peak tea season in Malawi. Thousands of farmers and pickers converge in the highland hills around Mulanji Massif to pluck the delicate new growth from 100 year old plants. #frogDR

Yesterday we headed 6ish hours south toward the tea regions of Thyolo (pronounced cholo!!) and Mulanji, Malawi, to continue #frogDR with smallholder farmers of fresh tea leaf. Caught a full rainbow somewhere along the drive, which reminded me, somehow, that even though I'm not home during these turbulent times it is my responsibility as an American to model what I want the world to know about America when they meet me: warm, intelligent, empathetic, bold, thoughtful, hardworking, optimistic, persevering, and giving. And also to enjoy the ride. ❤✌️🌈

Hiking out to the farms in a borrowed chitenje - worn as tradition and a sign of modesty and (for me) a symbol of solidarity and respect for Malawian women. @sarahbwe and I finally got a chance to visit the market in Blantyre to find our own chitenje, in brightly colored geometric batik prints. Also, I couldn't me more stoked on these @bedrocksandals, which have been absolutely perfect for rainy village walking.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/98d4d25bef07a7aa1ae34eedd6194831/5BD2297E/t51.2885-15/e35/16464595_726400407509099_1687505183312969728_n.jpg
A typical scene out my day during field work: our #frogDR team travels to a village to meet with the local farming co-op, introduce our project, and get permission to speak with the farmers in the community. We look for volunteers - average farmers who are willing to share their stories with us. Then we walk with them to their farm and spend a few hours talking and sharing stories. The conversation often looks a lot like this - myself (in a chitenje skirt) sitting with our research materials next to our local guide and translator, and the farmer (face cropped out for privacy) on the left. During the conversation we use activity worksheets to facilitate  stories of crop cycles, animal husbandry, financial hardships, and goals for the future. Throughout this project we're talking with chili and paprika farmers in northern Malawi, dairy farmers in the central region, and tea estate farmers in the south. This gentleman grows paprika chilis, rides his bike 20km to town every day, and diligently plans his next growing season using paper sales receipts. A hardworking, proud, and diligent man.

Hi! This is me. Friends, people I meet and collaborators often ask me what I do, so I thought I'd tell y'all about it. For the last 6+ years I've worked at @frog_design, a global design and strategy consultancy. My role is Principal Designer. This means I lead design and research teams on projects, from the early investigative phases of figuring out what problem to solve, to going out into the world to interview and observe the people we are designing for, to identify their underlying needs and behaviors, and to bring insights and opportunities to our clients in the form of useful, usable product and service ideas. We call it #frogDR. This is the best part of my job. I travel a lot to do this work - pretty much wherever our clients are. Like this month, I'm in Malawi working to uncover the needs of smallholder farmers and gaps in mobile services available to farmers throughout the country. The second best part of my job is that I get to spend quality time in incredible places that afford life-enriching experiences, and almost endless opportunities to learn about people. When I'm not home, the things I miss the most are my fiancé @matthewarthurbolick, my dog @arlo_gsp, my bed and maybe ice cream. To make the the time pass I always pack an Aeropress, coffee from @thebrewandbrew, a candle and my favorite @birkenstocks. I guess I'm writing this out of a combination of desire for my work self to be understood as much as it's a cathartic way to ease my homesickness from working so much. Several years in I feel pretty pro at this game, but that doesn't keep me from missing home. I may share lots of swimming photos, but that's because I love swimming and always try to squeeze it into the 12+ hour days we work when in the field. I've got two weeks to go on this adventure, which has been a trip of a lifetime, and a peak life experience. I try to stay in the moment and absorb every morsel, and I'll share a bit along the way.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/429481226db06b34e2b4bf933b960883/5BEB926E/t51.2885-15/e35/16229234_256428584784551_8307330811984609280_n.jpg
Second week in Malawi and our team has spent many hours on the road, exploring the northern part of the country. This roadside farmhouse and stand is a good example of the places our #frogDR team has been working the last 7 days.

Four days into Malawian life we packed our bags and made our way out of the capital to find a co-op of smallholder dairy farmers. Today started a country-wide journey of immersion and interviews with rural Malawians, to understand their mobile and financial needs and uncover real opportunities for useful technological innovation. Tomorrow we go north to Mzuzu. Not our van, but not mad. #frogDR

Dear Cochiti, I always looked forward to finding you in the field when I came home to visit and it was always the first thing I did. You were always close by and far away at the same time, with your relatable locks and lonesome eyes. Your stoic presence made me feel both wild and grounded. Your life was full of grass, song birds and mountain air, and you shared this field so well with the turkeys. When we found you your body had already started its transition back into the earth, and you will continue to give nourishment to the plants and animals, just as your presence nourished me. Rest In Peace my spirit animal. #cochitiforever #cochitilives

Rabbit brush is the home of the tiniest creature in the high desert winter - the field mouse. I like poking around to find their tracks and Arlo likes to flush them out of the brush.

The last half mile of the Boquillas canoe trek entailed floating under this old bridge, a defunct thoroughfare to La Linda, Mexico. Now it's barred up and ready for a stampede, despite the fact that the Rio Grande in only a few feet wide and deep below it. I'm so thankful to be able to traverse and embrace this land. I'm so saddened by the prospect of walling it off. I'm hopeful that we as a nation can maintain a peaceful and mutually respectful relationship with our neighbors and the world, despite recent turns in politics. And I plan on continuing to visit this land as often as I can, to learn from it, share it with the people I love, and advocate for it.

The wind was finally gone and the rolling hills of grass were a luxurious change from the sand and mud and dust of our previous camp. This was my favorite camp in Boquillas Canyon.

Mike 20 camp: we landed on the sandbar across from the Rabbit Ears just before dusk and set up thanksgiving dinner while we crossed our fingers that the last two canoes would roll in before nightfall.

Mile 8 camp: many hours of sustained 20+ mph winds meant fine dust had seeped into each nook of every sleeping bag, pot, water bottle and wrinkle. That didn't matter though because the canyon! And the 12 mile journey through Boquillas ahead! And the wind on the water must certainly let up, right? Spoiler alert: it got worse. But it also just got better, know what I mean?

Three days and 34 miles down the Rio Grande and damn! So full of nature and inspiration and beauty and wonderful people I just want to go back and do it all over again. What a perfect way to spend thanksgiving, reflecting on all of the things I have to be thankful for and planning to build a fantastic future filled with more days like this.
