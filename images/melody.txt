Look at that blue steel fierceness. Also this is me thinking a high collar thick silk shirt that hides the bump was a good idea. It’s 90 degrees and humid! I’ve learned my lesson.

When @vanityfair asked @jeanbrownhill if they could profile her and her company @sweeten_home she asked that they instead profile the 26 African American women who have raise over $1M in venture capital. THAT’S THE TOTAL NUMBER. First of all hats off to this incredible woman for doing that, that is sisterhood. Second that number is shocking. More of this coverage please! #vanityfair #foundersfair

In 2018 this is crazy. Employers we need to correct the institutional discrimination, women we need to get better at asking for what we deserve and earn. Support each other! Encourage each other and talk about asking for a raise with your friends. The more awareness and support we give each other the faster this gets fixed. 💪🏼💪🏽💪🏾💪🏿 #ask4more

YES!! Loving the photos and videos from #MarchForOurLives Wish I could be there. Keeping our nation’s children safe should be our top priority. Basic, common sense safety measures are a no-brainer. Tell your local representative, and VOTE in elections to make sure our future leaders are not spineless and action-less.

Grandma Catherine lived to be 100! We celebrated her life today by sharing a lot of stories and laughs. I’m so thankful to have had so many great years with her. The most patient and loving woman I’ve ever known. She was always laughing, and could also put down the extra big stack of IHOP pancakes. Fly high grandma. We will miss you.

I’m excited to announce that @styleseat now has an all-female board and an all-female executive team! This is a HUGE deal, because 74% of tech companies have NO women. For a long time I was the only woman and I’m so glad that’s changed. We have more to do to achieve diversity but this is a good first step. 💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥

My grandma just turned 100 years old! We grabbed hamburgers and she told me about growing up on a farm in Canada where she only spoke Ukrainian and rode a horse to school. Moving to LA as a nurse and marrying a handsome American air force pilot. Having seven children and no car. So many adventures. ❤️❤️

I met @kaorinikstudios in Chicago years ago. She said she wanted to move to LA to be a makeup artist/stylist and also do makeup for eco-fi horror films. And she DID it (check out @kaorinikstudiosfx). Those stories always impress me because everyone says they might do something but few have the courage and the follow-through to actually make it happen. 💪🏼💪🏼

After we left our hot zone hotel Charlie and I went to South Africa. It was a big trip for us. While he has been something like 30 times I’ve never been, and going on a safari is something I’ve wanted to do my whole life. I am obsessed with elephants in a way that is difficult to describe. To start, I have a seven foot elephant painting in my dining room. So seeing so many incredible animals in nature was a reminder of how beautiful our planet is, how lucky we are all to be here and definitely one of the most profound experiences of my life.

@charlieebersol and I got to spend Christmas in Paris, however we had such high fevers we were stuck in bed the entire trip. Here are some photos of our hotel lobby and room, and the selfie we grabbed after we hobbled to the Eiffel Tower for 60 seconds on the last day. STILL COUNTS.

I wrote an article published in @time this am about how we can address the sexual harassment problem that’s taken over the news cycles lately. This is not a Hollywood or Silicon Valley problem, it’s in every industry and permeates our culture. We need to teach our girls they are strong and can do anything they want, we need to mentor and support women who are early in their careers, and we need to celebrate women who have built businesses and changed the game. Link in bio. Tell me what you think!

It turns out wedding dress shopping is stressful! So much pressure for an expensive dress you're going to wear for a few hours. My business side says this is dumb let's elope but there's another side that says this is the one time you're getting married, make it count. Ahhhhhh 😬 (This is not the dress)

My grandma is 99 years old. A Ukrainian who grew up in 🇨🇦 she rode a horse to school every day. Became a nurse, married an American soldier, had 7 kids and raised them in San Francisco and then San Jose, CA. Her journey is how I got to be here and I'm thankful so to celebrate we partied at IHOP.

It's nice when your man is 6'4" and can make a 5'10" girl feel small. Also dressing up is the best. #vanityfair

It's been such an intense week. So many emotions. I love this country though, and I feel more determined than ever to make my company and our stylists crazy successful, and to help women however I can to kill it in tech and business. I believe our differences make us stronger and rather than deride and insult, we need to support and empower each other so that's what I'm focusing on 🔥
