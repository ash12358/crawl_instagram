I've been waiting for what seems like forever to share this, and now I finally can! Take a look at that cover art... See the name near the top sandwiched between amazing folks like Amber Benson (Tara from BUFFY!! and SO much more), Ellen Hopkins, Francesca Lia Block, and Rachel M. Wilson? That's my name. Which means that, yes, I have an essay in this important and beautiful anthology edited by the awesome Jessica Burkhart. I could not be prouder to have an essay alongside so many incredible writers. While it doesn't hit stores until April 2018, you can pre-order the hardcover now on Amazon (http://bit.ly/lifeinsidemymindbook) or likely from the Simon Pulse website itself as well. The essay I wrote is one of the most personal I've ever written. There are things in it that I had never told another soul. When Denise Neumyer read the essay before I sent it off to Jessica, I actually heard her gasp when she got to one specific part. I hadn't even told her about some of the things in it. So, why am I so open and honest and gut wrenchingly transparent in my writing? Because that's the only way to create a dialogue, push the conversation about mental illness, and maybe help some folks. We NEED to keep talking about these things. We NEED to be uncomfortable. We NEED to do all this to make a change. Hopefully, with this essay, I've done my part...at least a little bit. #Anxiety #DestigmatizeMentalIllness

Skylar drew this today. She's 8. She watched a YouTube video of someone drawing it and did it all freehand. I sat and watched her. No tracing. While the wife can draw quite well, I have ZERO drawing talent. But, to me, this is pretty dang incredible for an 8-year-old. Kiddo loves her art!

About two weeks ago, when my grandmother was transferred to hospice care, I told my mother that I'd like to try to make her urn. She looked at me a bit puzzled at first, as if to say, "Are you sure you know how to do that?" Well, at the time, I thought I knew HOW to do it, but I'd never actually DONE it before. I'd never turned a segmented piece and never turned anything larger than a small bowl. I hadn't even started actually turning seriously until this year. But I knew I wanted to try. Well, two weeks, a ton of work, and 97 pieces of walnut and purpleheart later, I've finally completed my grandmother's urn. It's not absolutely perfect, but I'm extremely proud of how it came out. It might be the most beautiful thing I've ever made, and I'm sure I'm the only one who will notice the imperfections. The purpleheart was a must to get her beloved Philadelphia Phillies colors in there, and my grandfather asked if I could use the end of a wooden bat as the finial on the lid, since she was a lifelong softball player. All in all, I'm very grateful to be able to create something for her, since I'll miss her like crazy. Hope you like it, Grandma. ‚ù§Ô∏è

This coming Saturday night, the Raritan Valley YMCA (on Tices Lane in East Brunswick) is having a Spa Night / Tricky-Tray. These are the items I made to donate to the tricky-tray. A multicolor titanium bottle stopper, a beautiful necklace twist pen (it's held on with a strong magnet so you can pull it off to use it very easily, but it's still very secure), and a walnut/maple/purpleheart cheeseboard/serving tray/breadboard. If you're planning on attending, I hope you'll try to bring this set home! More details about the event here: http://bit.ly/ymcaspanight

We spent every weekend of our summers there, my sister and I, swimming in the pool, munching on fresh vegetables from the garden, or tossing barely-inflated basketballs at a net-less hoop mounted on the garage. HORSE was the only option, and even that was out of the question when the bee's nest in the garage roof was buzzing. // She'd be in the kitchen prepping jars, slicing cucumbers, and writing dates on sticky labels. Our grandmother spent the entire weekend in that kitchen making pickles. Garlic spears. Dill chips. Mild wholes. She had every recipe memorized, and her technique was impeccable. Each jar vacuum sealed in a pot on the stove, allowed to cool, and then dated before it went into the basement for months, where the garlic and spices would weasel their way into each cucumber's fleshy middle. They're still the best pickles I've ever tasted. // That was years ago, but I can still feel the tangy bite of the garlic on my tongue. She still makes pickles, but nobody eats them anymore. They sit neglected on back porch tables. She'll grab a spear of her own, but I'm not sure if she actually wants to eat it or she just can't bear the thought that they've been forgotten. // We saw the change coming bit by bit. Her tone shifted from feisty to downright mean at times. Then she forgot to cook the biscuits every Thanksgiving. Before long, we had no idea what might be in the food she made, so we had to stop eating it. We didn't want to; we just had to. // The pool is gone now. The deep chasm where we spent every waking moment those summers is now filled with dirt, covered over by patchy grass. The basketball hoop is hanging on by a long-rusted bolt, and the garden is overgrown by weeds. The cousins that we held as babies are in college. It's just her and our grandfather now. He does the best he can, but she's not always there. She slips in and out, showing glimpses of the woman that made those pickles for so many years. And then she's gone again. // The pickles though. The sweet, spicy, sour, tangy pickles that filled those jars all lined up on shelves in the basement and on picnic tables every day in the summer. Those pickles are still the best I've ever tasted.

Also finished up this really cool Revolver pen! I used Thin Blue Line acrylic on this one, so it's perfect for police, law enforcement, or their families. üëÆüëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Swipe right to see it in action. You press the pin at the top of the cap. The barrel rotates (just like a revolver) and the pen ejects. To retract the pen tip, simply pull the trigger on the cap. Really neat. Just added it to the shop where you can get this particular one or, if you prefer, customize the acrylic and sub in wood if you don't like the law enforcement aspect. Get em while they're hot!

Just finished up this insane little Firefighter pen! üë®‚Äçüöí It is SO dang cool! Used Rosewood for the main part, but the hardware is gun metal and chrome. The tip looks like a fire hose, there's a fire truck inlay on the cap, and the end has a firefighter emblem. Coolest part is that you pull the axe to trigger the pen mechanism!

Fresh off the lathe and finished with food safe mineral oil is this adorable, little salt cup/bowl.

Hand-carved spoon number two in the books. Made this coffee scoop out of some of my leftover walnut. It holds approximately 1 tablespoon of whatever your little heart desires. All done with hand tools and sanded silky smooth. Finished with mineral oil and ready for use.

Decided to practice a little woodcarving. Been wanting to do it, but never really tried. Took about 2 hours to turn a small block of leftover walnut into a baby spoon. It was really just to practice, and it's definitely not perfect, but I'm pretty happy with how it came out. Next time, on to full size spoons! Doing this one, I had two disadvantages: Dry, hardwood and a VERY tiny project, which didn't leave much room to maneuver. This is gonna be fun! #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #mineraloil #spoon #carving #woodcarving #marokniv #spoons

Once the cherry was all gone, I realized I still needed one more cutting board. So I grabbed the last chunk of walnut I had left from when I made my sister's coffee table, inlaid some maple, and put it all together. I LOVE how this one came out. It's smaller, but walnut is easily my favorite wood. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #walnut #maple #cuttingboard #cuttingboards #gift #christmas

Can finally share a pic of the Cherry cutting boards I made family for Christmas this year. Had a large slab of cherry that I was going to make into a bench. Decided to turn it into 6 cutting boards instead.

Took this photo with the Depth Effect feature on the iPhone 7 Plus. For a beta, it's really not too bad. They still have quite a ways to go towards making it look more natural, but it's a very good start. Using it is tricky, especially if you don't have good light, but I think that it'll improve through firmware updates. Pretty neat. #iphone7plus #deptheffect #portraitmode #bokeh #iphone7 #iphone #beta #nofilter

This feels like one of those breakthrough moments when you‚Äôre learning a new skill. The bunk bed I built for Skylar was a huge accomplishment and I‚Äôm proud of it, but while I do love how it looks, it‚Äôs also quite utilitarian. // This coffee table, however, feels like ART to me. It just feels like something that can work on its own, in its own beautiful way. // Is that corny? Yup, but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of this little mid-century modern style coffee table. I took 3 rough sawn pieces of walnut, shaped them, glued them, sanded them, clear coated them, and turned them into this piece of useful art. // It‚Äôs a pretty great feeling and I hope my sister digs it.

Two more magnetic bottle openers in the books! One for my Pops (he gave me the Coca-Cola opener to use for it) and one for the neighbor's bar. Not only does it hang onto the fridge perfectly (that magnet is SUPER strong), but it also catches the bottle caps after you open your bottle. It‚Äôll hold probably 50 or more caps at a time. There are also keyholes in the back in case you want to hang it on a non-metal surface. Pretty simple project that I can customize very easily for anyone‚Äôs needs. Made from scratch with Oak and Maple, if you‚Äôre interested in one, just hit me up and we‚Äôll chat. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #custom #woodworker #bessey #rustoleum #teamrigid #rigidpowertools #rustic #hardwood #lacquer #oak #maple #lamination #glueup #bottleopener #magnets #magnetic #dowoodworking

Since building the bunk bed for Skylar, she hasn't been able to use her old nightstand since she's always on the top bunk. So I took about two hours today and used some scrap wood I had lying around to make a quick wall shelf. It even has a little lip so nothing falls off. She chose the matte purple color, which I really dig. Wiggle Bear approves! #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #rustoleum #lacquer #minwax #craftsman #rigid #teamrigid #kregjig #rigidpowertools #dowoodworking #wigglebear #bunkbed #prouddad #ibuiltthat #shelf

A few months ago, I barely knew anything about woodworking, but I decided I wanted to learn. Around that same time, Skylar told me and Denise that she wanted a bunk bed. In a moment of crazy overconfidence, I told Denise, "Before you buy one, let me try to make one. I'm not sure if I can do it, but I want to try." There were quite a few times when I wasn't sure I could actually do it, but I pulled through. I actually built my kid a bunk bed from scratch. The only thing I didn't do was chop down the trees and mill the lumber. Instead, I spent 185 bucks at Lowe's, overloaded my Jeep, and hauled it home. Then I got to building over the past couple weekends. My wife is a saint for giving me the time needed to work on this thing. If I never build another thing ever again, I'll forever be immensely proud of this bunk bed. Tons of work and it's not perfect. Mistakes were made. But it's incredibly solid and Skylar absolutely loves it. I'd say that's worth it. #TheBigBuild #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #rustoleum #lacquer #minwax #craftsman #rigid #teamrigid #kregjig #rigidpowertools #dowoodworking #wigglebear #bunkbed #prouddad #ibuiltthat @ridgidpowertools

Another project in the books, but this one I'm pretty proud of. Maple and oak tea light holder. Started with a couple solid chunks of maple and oak, ripped em down, and then did a glue up that involved about 20 clamps. Sanded and sanded and sanded. Drilled out the holes for the tea lights. Routed a quick chamfer on the top edges. Finished with a few coats of spray lacquer. Not perfect, but I'm happy with how it came out. Denise isn't really into candles, so I'm not sure what I'll do with it yet. Maybe sell it if anyone wants to buy. If so, just let me know. Either way, I'm pretty proud of it. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #bessey #rustoleum #rustic #hardwood #lacquer #oak #maple #lamination #glueup #tealights #candle #dowoodworking #ryobination

Latest project finally done, even though it was fairly simple. Skylar wanted to MAKE her teacher's year-end gift this year. We decided on a pencil holder with the holes in the shape of her teacher's initials CT. Cut stock from some Douglas Fir 4x4 I had in the garage, laid out the holes, slowly drilled them out with the drill press (had to do it twice to get the right depth - a longer bit would've made that easier), and sanded it square and smooth. Then Skylar painted the whole thing with acrylic paints. Stamped the bottom and a few coats of clear spray lacquer finished it off. Holes aren't perfect (the last one, of course, ended up askew), but Skylar is thrilled with it, so that makes me happy. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #rustoleum #rustic #dowoodworking #plaidcrafts #wigglebear #gift #school #teacher #teachergifts #teacherappreciation

Was working on a longer project today, but decided to bust through this other one quickly. Skylar needed somewhere to hang her necklaces, collectible dog tags, etc so I made her this. Gave it a round over with the trim router. A little Dark Walnut stain, a bump of clear lacquer, and some pink berry spray paint finishes it off. She digs it and I'm pretty happy with how it came out. Simple project, but sometimes those are the most fun. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #rustoleum #rustic #plywood #lacquer #wigglebear

New shelves made and installed. Honestly, a super simple project, but one that will be really useful. We've had this tall cabinet since we moved in and everything just falls to the bottom. Took me 3 years to realize there were shelf holes in the walls. So I decided to make some shelves. #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #rustoleum #rustic #plywood #lacquer

Woodworking Project #3 complete! This one was actually started before project #2 but it took a while to finish. Skylar did this awesome chalk drawing of a peacock in her art class, so I decided to make a frame for it...from scratch. I did everything from cut the wood, paint it, lacquer it, assemble, cut the glass and backing board, and put it all together. It's not perfect. The mitre joints are not perfect. The finish isn't perfect. But I learned a lot making it and the kiddo loves it. Used @rustoleumusa spray paint to get the super pink look to go with her pink room. Finished with some clear spray lacquer. On to the next one! Will post more detailed pics on my FB if you want to follow me there.

Woodworking Project #2 complete! Made 2 of these fun frames for Mother's Day. One for my mom and one for my mother in law. Really fun project they can hang and the best part is that they can swap out photos whenever they want. Fits up to 5x7 photos. Inspired by @macnwood's awesome distressed frames. I took his basic template, switched up a few things, and made my own version. They're not perfect, but I'm happy with how they came out for my second project. Would you dig a frame like this? #AchievementUnlocked #handmade #handmadebyme #woodworking #woodcraft #diy #photo #frame #diyproject #ryobination #ryobipowertools #ryobi #dewalt #dewalttools #imake #make #custom #woodworker #mothersday #gift

Every year, I try to learn a new skill. One year it was metal detecting. Another year was video editing. Once I finally settle on the skill for that year, I just throw myself into it full bore. This year, I chose woodworking. It's something I've always had an interest in, but never got around to trying it. Well, after many books and articles and hundreds of videos, I finally took the plunge. Here is my first completed project. Made it for the wife as she loves to garden and needed more space than the little plastic one. It's far from perfect. Mistakes were made. But it's not too bad for a first project, so I'm proud of it. Here's to many more (smaller, lighter) projects! #woodworking #handmadebyme #handmade #woodcraft #garden #gardening #diy
