FYI this is my face...this is how I wear it...just because I’m not smiling doesn’t mean I’m mad- although telling me to smile or saying I should smile more will likely lead down that road. More often than not I’m just extremely distracted and lost in thought. I’m considering shaving off my eyebrows, never smiling and only speaking in a monotone voice just so people will have to guess what I’m emoting 😅😖😡😥

Finally posting to my account after a yearlong break. Took Lia to Born Free for the first time where she made friends with everyone she met and cracked me up the whole weekend. Nice seeing you and your family there @20thcenturyracing! #bf10

Happy birthday to the hardest working man @oldstf...without your hard work and talent we would've starved long ago. Thanks for being the sane, patient one in the group and keeping us together 😘🌹🎉

@flyingpez caught me geeking out at a comic store while @oldstf and my kids couldn't be any less interested 😕

One minute we're in Portland attending a motorcycle show with our kids, next minute we discover that all hell broke loose at the Oroville Dam and our hometown and surrounding areas were being evacuated. We couldn't make it home, Mike's parents couldn't get out, our pets were stuck there and our dog was freaking out. We finally made it home yesterday, packed what we could and met up at Mike's parents house and then just waited, unsure what to do next. We ended up back at home late last night, only to discover creeps hanging around outside the neighborhood, making us nervous. I slept with a pistol by my side and a shotgun next to Mike. Now the evacuation orders been lifted, but there's still more storms coming and risk of flooding. Some say it's safe to be home again, but then other reports advise to stay away. We've still got our trailer and vehicles ready to go, but I've just been sitting here unsure of what to do. I have a dreaded feeling that something is missing, being overlooked or underestimated. If it was just Mike and I it wouldn't bother me as much, but getting the kids out is what worries me. Ironically, we had initially left town because we were both feeling anxious and stressed out, only to return to a situation a hundred times worse than whatever we were originally worried about. Now I feel helpless just waiting for something that may or may not happen. And to makes things worse, one of my contact lenses (hard ones that have to be specially made) broke and I've got an itch that moves when I try to scratch it and I left my ice cream at Mike's parents house. So here I sit, blind in one eye, itchy and ice cream-less. 😜😬😕

#fbf that time the sun was shooting crazy rainbow beams all over the backseat and I thought maybe I was a celestial being or something and was about to ascend into heaven - but then I burst into flames and thought maybe it's the complete opposite...got one hell of a tan though 👼🏼☀️🔥😈

Long ago me and this handsome dude were young and full of energy. Now we're both getting gray hair, lay in bed a lot and groan when we move. But he still thinks he's a puppy and people still think I'm a child so I guess there's that 🤔#foreveryoung

After an agonizing week of pain followed by a root canal today, this was a much needed pick me up. Lia calls it the "Mega IPad" because it's 13" and bigger than her...and because she's adorable. FYI try not to sneeze at the dentist while he's holding a drill/torture device- I sneezed twice and almost ended up with a lobotomy 😫🤕😶 #thingstoavoid

Don't mess with the Pilaczynski's- they call him "The Godfather" and I'm his enforcer 👊🏻💥 Thanks @theycallmegaycey for this epic photo - you've captured us precisely...I'm gonna crop me out of it and blow this up to poster size, frame it and hang it over our fireplace mantle...if we ever get one that is.

Fun times at #belden7, which included me and Jessica breaking into an old schoolhouse at 3am and getting busted by @ian_walker_heard and @oldstf. She swore it was haunted and I was anticipating stumbling over bodies or being hung from a hook. Besides turning into a felon with a death wish after hours, I also apparently have a habit of giving away my blankets - I gave away two of them, one which Mike claims I stripped off him to give to some random dude...which is only half true. Can't wait for next year 🤘🏼

I've been going through a huge art phase lately. Drawing is the one thing I've ever been semi decent at (except for my killer dance moves and angelic singing voice of course), but I've never done anything with that ability nor progressed beyond using pencils, because they're safe, erasable and I'm a fanatic. So I've been challenging myself to try different artistic mediums, like watercolor, markers etc. This picture was a sketch challenge submitted to @deviantart (an art community) using the @autodesksketchbook app and represents two firsts: the first time I've drawn a skull completely and my first ever digital drawing, using an iPad mini and a cheap stylus. I'm really stoked because I've been wanting to do digital art for awhile but could never quite get the hang of it. Now that I've finally done one I feel more confident going forward. Yea me🤘🏻😝 #digitalpainting #deviantart #SketchThis

I've never been great at sketching so I challenged myself by using fineliner pens so I can't erase 😬 @oldstf had me draw him a Porsche, a vice and a Bridgeport mill...now I remember why I always used pencil. #sketches #stabilo

It's already been 8 years today since my father passed away, but I still remember every detail like it happened yesterday. Tomorrow would have normally been my birthday too (long story). The saddest part is he never got to meet Lia. He wasn't perfect by any means, but he was hardworking, very intelligent and humorous. Without him my life wouldn't have been the same...so thanks Dad for taking a chance on us. Now I'm going to go drown myself in chocolate 😞 #RIP

At last. A nice, clean hotel room wasn't enough to put me to sleep, but the backseat of a truck going down the highway while lying on my dog does the trick. I'm like an infant 👶🏼 #nowfeedme

I told him to smile but he said he was trying to look sexy. At least I think he said that, we're both pretty tired from riding in the truck all day 😴🐕

During a blackout this week I sat down on a crappy shelf and then fell through it, scratching my ass on a nail on the way down. I thought that stung until my cat tried to jump on my bed using my face as a ladder. At least @oldstf's having fun calling me "Scarface" and saying I look like I got attacked by Wolverine...which actually sounds cooler than admitting I have a cat who's unable to jump the whole 1 foot off the floor to get on my bed

I'm tempted to sew a little pouch to wear around my neck so I can carry my new furry best friend everywhere with me. I tried to put him on my shoulder like a parrot but he kept falling off, and for some reason he doesn't want to stay in my back pocket....weird. Also, I can feel someone's jealous eyes burning a hole in the back of my head in this picture 👀🔥

Gave myself a much needed dye job 💁People were starting to doubt that I'm a natural dirty blonde. Flaming redhead is way more believable. Plus I feel like a superhero or something.

It's a sad day. I'm selling these super rare green snake print Dr. Martens because try as I may, I just can't get my feet to shrink enough for them to fit. 😫😭I guess I could just not walk in them and just sit and gaze at them admiringly. But if anyone has small feet (UK 3, U.S. 5.5) and wants to buy them they're $180 shipped, which is way less than I paid. And they're in mint condition. #vintageboots #drmartens #docmartens #docs #forsale

Cleaning out my closet and came across this little gem of a leather vest. Need someplace to wear it, though, other than lying in bed while eating pizza. Which sounds cool but in reality looks kinda sad 🍕😔 #leathervest #harleydavidson

Thank you @murdercityvintage for the awesome package of goodies, including this rad vintage HD jacket. It's like 1000 degrees outside but I'm tempted to crank the AC down to 50 indoors just so I have an excuse to wear this. Check out his shop because not only does he have the coolest vintage stuff but his captions alone are worth it. 😋👌🏼ps. Check out the tag he included where he managed to turn my name into an ambigram which I didn't know was possible. Don't call me Susana though. Or Susan. Or at all, I hate talking on the phone. Where was I? Oh yeah, thank you Zach! 😆 #rambling #vintage #supportsmallbusiness #patches

I'm really bad at promoting my own business so here goes: this is a bolt in seat hinge mount for big twin frames. Manufactured in house. It's @oldstf's genius idea. It's actually a really simple concept and solves common issues with seat mounting and stuff. Okay I'm a lousy salesman. But you need this #oldstf #chopperpartsforyou #bigtwin #choppershit #supportsmallbusiness
