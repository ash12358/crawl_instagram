Swinging into the week in Banff and out of it in London üß° we finally made it to Lake Louise last night and it was as beautiful as you all said! Also Lake Moraine is even more beautiful not at sunrise (odd, I know). Thanks @jessomewhere for giving me directions to this spot! It‚Äôs epic and we‚Äôve already gone multiple times. üì∏: @anchoredimage http://liketk.it/2wzNP #liketkit @liketoknow.it

We‚Äôre doing a good job of avoiding the crowds but still haven‚Äôt seen Lake Louise at all and Lake Moraine only at sunrise. On a scale from 1-10 how tragic is it if we don‚Äôt make it to Lake Louise?

Having sooo much fun in Chicago at @lakeshakefest! For those unfamiliar, it‚Äôs basically Stagecoach but with a better lineup in a more intimate and pretty venue.

Got a new post up on ckanani.com all about how you can visit Fly Geyser! This is one of the beautiful hot springs on the private Fly Ranch property. . I‚Äôm laughing because @lmonitz had just told me that I *am* awkward in photos. I do not like being in front of the camera and basically refuse to do fake candid things but luckily I have friends to make fun of me so that I laugh foreal instead! ;) . üì∏: @nvkait (major bonus points to the @travelnevada team for basically all secretly being pro photographers on the side) . #DFMI #travelnevada

After Fly Ranch on Friday the @travelnevada team took us to check out a pottery studio/gallery also on their Burner Byway (Reno to the Black Rock Desert) itinerary. Since it‚Äôs totally off the grid (there‚Äôs not even power), it‚Äôs run mainly off of solar. . It was adorable and reminded me a lot of being home in Santa Fe where my dad grew up. Great place to pick up some gifts to bring home! . When you think of Nevada you likely think of Las Vegas or casinos and gambling, and that‚Äôs why I love trips like this so much. We get to uncover hidden gems and see things beyond the main tourist attractions (which are almost never something I‚Äôm into anyway). And then we get to share them with you! . #DFMI #travelnevada

I spent the majority of last week exploring western Nevada with @travelnevada. On Friday we got to check out Fly Geyser on Fly Ranch in the black rock desert, a private area owned by Burning Man. They recently opened up nature walks on the property to the public. . In addition to Fly Geyser which is unreal, the property has other awesome things like beautiful hot springs and this dock that is actually an art piece. . I highly recommend visiting and going on the walk if you find yourself in the area, it was one of my favorite parts of the trip! . #DFMI #travelnevada . http://liketk.it/2wbWG #liketkit @liketoknow.it

‚ÄúIf I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody. Open your mind, get up off the couch, move.‚Äù ‚Äî Anthony Bourdain. RIP :(

Yesterday morning I was looking through my Midsummer photos when I randomly got a FaceTime call from this guy + the @slussenspensionat crew saying, in part, that they had been doing the same. . I think that‚Äôs my favorite thing about travel (and something I often think about on the plane ride over)... You leave on an adventure not knowing what you‚Äôll encounter or who you‚Äôll meet. One minute you‚Äôre strangers, the next you‚Äôre far from it. . My mom snapped this probably 30 minutes into us meeting. If you‚Äôre sassy and fun I‚Äôll love you immediately... bonus points if you‚Äôll make flower crowns with me, be in a million photos, and wake up at 5am for an adventure. Such a special day at a truly wonderful place. . Thinking of all of you at @slussenspensionat ‚ù§Ô∏è miss you and hope to see you soon!

This time last year we were driving New Zealand north to south during the ‚Äúworst storm in generations‚Äù (on the opposite side of the road!), jumping backwards off waterfalls in dark caves, eating dried noodles out of vending machines (ew), and hiking every second we weren‚Äôt driving (or wine tasting). I think this is my ‚Äútravel and adventures make me happy‚Äù face ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The downside to this whole travel for a living thing is that I‚Äôve been really bad about visiting family and friends like I used to do frequently. I‚Äôm so happy to have FINALLY actually booked a Hawai‚Äôi ticket after wayyyy too much time away. Can‚Äôt wait to celebrate @stephleilani and @nickwilkin11 (again). Your turn, @lizzybraun! üòú

Today I came back to my favorite fairytale town and it is just as wonderful as I remember it being üòç I also went to Neuschwanstein Castle and to my grandpa‚Äôs hometown to say hey to my great grandpa, 2x great grandpa, and 3x great grandpa at the cemetery. Pretty successful Bavarian day!

The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is easily one of the most magnificent places I‚Äôve ever been. Y‚Äôall should probably visit for this reason alone. Also @d11egop says the more covered I am, the better I look so I now exclusively post photos of myself from Dubai.

One of my favorite spots in Dubai üíô it‚Äôs a tea house and restaurant in the most beautiful space with delicious, healthy food. Thanks again for the recommendation, @sequeiras!

This hot Dubai sunshine has me dreaming of summers spent roaming Europe with my best girlfriends, Vespa rides along the coast, bike rides through the countryside, living on a sailboat, and swimming in as many seas as possible. Where shall we go?!

Fun fact: I‚Äôve never owned a car. I actually have no interest in owning one but if I did I think it would be this. So cute and so much fun! But preferably in the yellow or teal colors - they just weren‚Äôt positioned well for a photograph so you‚Äôre stuck with this one üòÇ

Today I‚Äôm heading to Dubai and it‚Äôll be the longest I‚Äôve ever been on a plane for üò¨ Anyone have good podcast recommendations? I need something to help pass the time, please!

Whoever said the coldest winter they ever spent was a summer in San Francisco obviously hadn‚Äôt been to the top of Glacier 3000 in Gstaad, Switzerland. I‚Äôm just glad @borderfreetravels flew her drone even though it warned her not to so that I can forever remember this -18¬∞ moment. . Fun fact: this is the world‚Äôs first suspension bridge spanning two summits. #inlovewithswitzerland

Ever hiked in freezing water for 5+ hours straight? Would you? I was convinced I would be cold and wet the entire time but guess what! I wasn‚Äôt. Even in winter. Even though we were in the shade 95% of the time. . My main takeaway from last weekend with @atozion and @travelmindset is that winter is *definitely* the best time to visit St. George. And I‚Äôve got a new post up on ckanani.com breaking down all of the reasons why! . #instameetstgeorge

The Petrified Dunes at Snow Canyon in St. George are one of those places you see photos of and think it looks cool but in person is a whole different experience. When we arrived I snapped some pics and then sat down to watch the sunset and take it all in because it was kind of blowing my mind. @carradventure from @atozion said most people skip Snow Canyon and just go to @zionnps and after going I‚Äôm totally unclear as to why. If nothing else, at least stop by the Petrified Dunes when visiting! #instameetstgeorge

Golden hour at Zion ‚ú®. . Had such a great weekend in St. George with @atozion and @travelmindset. We hiked the Narrows, Snow Canyon, Elephant Arch, and Canyon Overlook seen here! I learned that winter is definitely the time to go, as the weather is beautiful (we were in tank tops yesterday) and the crowds are small. . Have y‚Äôall been yet? . #instameetstgeorge

Warm sunshine and highs of 17 in SF feels a bit different than the lows of -18 over the past few weeks in Switzerland üò± no time to enjoy it though cause I‚Äôm off to the next adventure tomorrow at 6am! Anyone else comin to the @travelmindset #InstaMeetStGeorge?!

QUESTION! Of all the adventures we went on with @myswitzerland, which was your favorite or the one you‚Äôd most like to do? -Tobogganing in Zermatt -Hot air balloon ride in Chateau-d‚ÄôOex -Fondue hike in Gstaad -Dog sled ride in Gstaad -Glacier 3000 (that huge crazy suspension bridge) in Gstaad -Sledging to Grindelwald -Cliff Walk in Jungfrau Region -First flyer/glider in Jungfrau Region -The spa at @victoriajungfrau in Interlaken (ha) . I got so many replies about the various excursions but I‚Äôm curious overall which was everyone‚Äôs favorite! #inlovewithswitzerland . PS. My story is saved to my highlights if you need a refresher on any of those things ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I first visited @myinterlaken and @jungfrauregion five or so years ago and had such a wonderful time that it has held a spot in my ‚Äúfavorite places of all time‚Äù list ever since. When @borderfreetravels and I started planning this trip with @myswitzerland it immediately came to mind as a place I‚Äôd like to include in the itinerary, especially because I had never been in winter and Kristen had never visited at all. . Over the last few days I have been happy to discover that it is equally as wonderful in winter and still full of so many fun adventures! Yesterday we went to the top of Jungfraujoch which was a tad bit colder than it was last time when I went in July üòâ We then got sledges and spent 2-3 hours sledding down the mountain into Grindelwald, stopping every so often for photos and a hot drink or two.  You can catch the video on my story still if you‚Äôre quick - it was honestly such a blast.  Then today we went up to First to do the Cliff Walk you see in the photo! It was a bit scary but honestly incredible as only us and the mountain peaks were above the clouds. . The region is very popular so I would not be surprised if many of you have visited already, but if you haven‚Äôt yet checked it out in winter I would definitely suggest doing so!

I fell in love with Switzerland in 1996 during my first visit and have continued to love it more and more with each trip. Yesterday when we arrived in Gstaad I knew almost immediately that I had found a new Swiss love, one that I‚Äôll be talking about for years to come and visiting again and again. It‚Äôs filled with so much charm and character making even a 15 minute stroll down the car-free village center a treat. . It‚Äôs been a little over 24 hours since we arrived and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve stopped smiling since, despite only getting 4 hours of sleep. After a winter hike with a fondue backpack to make fondue with in the middle of the alps, dog sledding in the early morn with the sweetest pups, and a jaw-dropping afternoon crossing a suspension bridge in -18 degree weather, I can‚Äôt imagine what else we could uncover if we had more time here. Luckily there is one thing I know for sure, and that is that I‚Äôll be back ‚ù§Ô∏è. . #inlovewithswitzerland #charminggstaad #gstaad #comeupslowdown #alpineauthenticity

Today was truly magical. I‚Äôll spare you the details since I‚Äôve been raving about it nonstop all day on my story, but you can definitely catch me here next year at the 41st International Balloon Festival. Wanna join? . #inlovewithswitzerland #Chateaudoex #FIB40 #FIB2018 #Paysdenhaut

Yesterday we said goodbye to Zermatt after a wonderful 4 nights and made our way to Pays-d‚ÄôEnhaut. We‚Äôre here for ChaÃÇteau-d‚ÄôOex‚Äôs 40th International Hot Air Balloon Festival which we kicked off last night with the Night Glow (a display of fireworks and glowing balloons to choreographed music). This morn we‚Äôre going to ride in a hot air balloon (my first!) and later we head to Gstaad for a fondue hike! Oh and they speak French here so thank goodness I am 2% fluent.

Have you guys been keeping up with my stories? @borderfreetravels and I are having an absolute blast in #Zermatt with @myswitzerland and @zermatt.matterhorn. Sadly today is our last day before we move onto the next adventure but we had a lovely (and very relaxing!) day exploring town in the snow.

Had sooo much fun tobogganing today in @zermatt.matterhorn with @borderfreetravels!

I‚Äôve been busy editing a million photos, trying to get some blogposts finished and scheduled before I‚Äôm on the road again for 3.5 weeks. This one in particular makes me laugh because it was a bit of a struggle behind the scenes but you gotta do it for the Insta, right? ;) . #furore #fiordodifurore #amalficoast

After years of consistently being asked what to do in Seattle, I finally have a guide up on the blog! Just in time for #SeattleMuseumMonth. . February is Seattle Museum Month which means if you book a room at participating hotels you get a museum pass for half-price tickets at 40 museums.  I've narrowed down my top museum recommendations, in addition to some other suggestions on what to see, do, and eat while visiting my beautiful hometown at ckanani.com. Direct link in my Insta story! . Have you visited Seattle yet? What‚Äôs your favorite thing to do there? . #seattle #visitseattle [ad]

This trip to Lisbon was the first time I‚Äôve ever gone to a city in Europe and stayed put for longer than a week. Since I had visited before and had so much time it was awesome not to feel pressured to run around 24/7. Now I want to go somewhere else and stay for a full month! What‚Äôs the longest you‚Äôve stayed somewhere and where was it?

Tell me something about yourself! - A bit of fun fact overload today but @the_flyaway_girl is insisting that I obey her request so here are 10 random get-to-know-me facts: - 1. Most of my friends call me ‚Äòcks‚Äô (my initials) 2. I have loved photography my whole life and I shoot @canonusa because my grandpa did 3. I‚Äôm super uncomfortable on the other side of the camera, but I‚Äôm trying to change that! 4. I love music soo much and have a @spotify playlist for *everything*. I also know the lyrics to basically every song 5. I drink iced coffee year round, no matter how cold out it is 6. I do not count countries and have no idea how many I‚Äôve been to. I‚Äôd rather just go where I want to go.. i.e. Italy over and over and over and over 7. I prefer off the beaten path places 8. I‚Äôm a proud Virgo and loveeeee fellow (crazy, neurotic) Virgos! 9. I‚Äôm horrible with makeup so instead I have a serious (and expensive) skincare addiction. My fav is @skinceuticals, plus @larocheposayusa, @skii, @skinmedica, and newly @laneige_us! 10. I reallyyyy love podcasts, especially @wrongfulconviction (@itsjasonflom is such a gem), @theladygang (@keltie is insane but my spirit animal), & @themorningbreath (the most prestigious morning show around). Also anything @ashley_iaconetti is on - What about you? Tell me a fun fact! And fav skincare brand? Fav podcast? Are you a Virgo?! - PS. For everyone asking for more deets on the @taylorswift run in in my story, I‚Äôll drop it in a story soon! Too long to type!

Today is quite rainy so I decided to get some work done while also cafe hopping (one of many blogposts coming soon!). This is @fabricacoffeeroasters on one of my favorite streets in the city, R. das Flores, which is also home to my favorite restaurant @tabernadasflores.

Last but not least, my very favorite @westsweden day was Midsummer (of course)! . We spent it at picturesque @slussenspensionat on the island of Orust where Vibs (the owner) and her family very graciously invited us to celebrate with them. We: ‚Äî Picked fresh flowers from the garden and made our own midsummer flower crowns (midsommarkrans) ‚Äî Danced and sang around the midsummer pole in the rain ‚Äî Had traditional homemade midsummer lunch with Vibs, her family and close friends. There was a lot of singing and toasting and drinking some crazy drink that tasted like pure alcohol üòÇ so much fun ‚Äî Had fresh muscles for dinner at @slussenspensionat. So fresh that I could see from the table where they were caught! ‚Äî Sang and danced yet again all night to the live band. Even my mom stayed out past 2am! ‚Äî Picked 7 different types of flowers at 2 or 3am in the dark and in the rain to put under my pillow (another Swedish tradition). Whoever I dreamed about was supposed to be my future partner but @harrystyles still hasn‚Äôt called ‚Äî Got up at 5am to kayak, searching for seals! Didn‚Äôt see any seals but we angered a lot of birds and had a blast . Everyone at @slussenspensionat (and in West Sweden in general, actually) was SO SWEET to us and made us feel like we were a part of the family. So many people we met said they come back every single year and I can definitely see why! Thanks again for having us üíõ

After Gothenburg we took our @volvocarusa on a @westsweden road trip.  These are all from the islands of Tj√∂rn and Marstrand. . Fun facts/tips: ‚Äî There are over 8,000 islands in West Sweden ‚Äî On Tj√∂rn there is a watercolor museum (@nordiskaakvarellmuseet) and an outdoor sculpture park (@pilaneheritage). Both are awesome ‚Äî Tj√∂rn is home to Sweden‚Äôs first floating hotel Salt & Sill. The restaurant there is amazing as are the views. @voguemagazine recommends it too ‚Äî I still have no idea how to say ‚ÄúTj√∂rn‚Äù ‚Äî Marstrand is incredibly charming and so small that you can easily walk around the perimeter ‚Äî The best Marstrand views are from Carlsten Fortress.  Our hotel @marstrandshavshotell gave us a lunch pack to take to the top for a picnic!  It was, of course, lovely

Of all the new places you visited in 2017, which was your favorite?  Most of you answered my poll question wrong - mine was West Sweden! . I went in partnership with @visitsweden_us, @goteborgcom, @westsweden, @flysas, and @volvocarusa and it was magical ‚ú® Why? Let‚Äôs start with Gothenburg: ‚Äî It was sunny everyday, with 18+ hours of daylight ‚Äî The food was amazing.  Fresh, healthy, and mostly seafood and veggies (i.e. my favs). Gothenburg alone has 7 Michelin-starred restaurants ‚Äî Everything was gorgeous. The shops, cafes, restaurants, parks, streets - all absolutely beautiful and a photographer‚Äôs dream ‚Äî There was soo much to see and do. I was in Gothenburg for 5 full days and that wasn‚Äôt nearly enough ‚Äî They graciously allowed me to invite a +1 so I brought my mom. We hadn‚Äôt been to Europe together since 1996 so it was extra special

Another 2017 highlight ‚Äî Manchester! . In May I went to Manchester with @virginatlantic and @visitmanchester in honor of Virgin launching a new direct flight there from SF. My trip was full of the most adorable (Instagrammable) restaurants and bars, a lot of soccer/football, the cutest British facades, my new favorite market (@altymarket), and, of course, music! I also got to meet some of my fav Insta friends in person finally (@vagabond3, @lifeasjenn) plus make some new ones. . It is a wonderful city and only 2 hours by train from London so definitely check it out. And if you‚Äôre from SF also, you can now fly there direct with @virginatlantic üòé #sponsored

Back to the 2017 travel highlight reel! In April we spent a few weeks road tripping from the top of New Zealand all the way down to Queenstown, doing casual things like jumping backwards off waterfalls in pitch black caves and running from Cyclone Cook (the worst storm in decades). . Some takeaways: ‚ÄîAs expected, I liked the South Island a lot more ‚ÄîYou should definitely not speed anywhere in New Zealand ‚ÄîWanaka and Queenstown are especially awesome ‚ÄîLuging is more fun than it sounds! ‚ÄîPeople weren‚Äôt lying about the Roy‚Äôs Peak hike being boring beyond words ‚ÄîDriving on the other side of the road feels natural and is not at all scary ‚ÄîThe glow worm caves are actually not a tourist trap if you see them via an adventure with @legendaryblackwaterraftingco ‚ÄîAnd most importantly, New Zealand is really not that far. @airnz flights leave SF at night, you eat dinner, watch a movie, go to sleep, and then you wake up in Auckland. 13 hours direct. Go visit.

What do you guys think of @fairmontsanfrancisco so far? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gotten more replies to my stories in my life, so it definitely seems like you‚Äôre a fan! . I had so much fun yesterday at holiday gingerbread tea in their Laurel Court Restaurant & Bar and also in the jaw dropping Sparkle Suite. It‚Äôs hard to believe it could get any better but tonight I am switching to the Santa Suite and cannot wait. . What‚Äôs the Santa Suite? Oh it‚Äôs just the suite Santa stays in when he visits SF, decked out in holiday decor. There‚Äôs a candy and hot chocolate bar (adult beverages included), a gingerbread house kit, and a selection of classic holiday movies. And they kindly invited my sister @stephleilani and 5 year old niece to join me so they‚Äôre on a plane en route right now! MAGICAL. .

Today I am super excited to be kicking off a fun project with the beautiful @fairmontsanfrancisco! For those that aren‚Äôt familiar, it is remarkable year round but especially during the holidays thanks to its world famous, two story, life-sized gingerbread house (among many other things). I heard it‚Äôs even bigger than last year‚Äôs! . I‚Äôll be checking in for a few days, along with some special guests of mine, so make sure to keep up with my story - I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to be pretty magical ‚ú®üéÑ‚ù§Ô∏è #fairmontmoments

After @theyachtweek in July I spent a week in Mykonos and Santorini where I did really fun things like go to the hospital because there are no doctors on the island üòã... . All jokes aside though, they are both absolutely beautiful but a little too touristy (and overpriced) for my liking. I strongly recommend Hydra or something else instead!

Easily one of my favorite weeks of 2017 üíõ There is truly nothing like living on a small boat with a bunch of friends, sailing around one of the most beautiful countries in the world (Greece). . After loving @theyachtweek Croatia last summer, @lizzybraun and I decided we were brave enough to go back for round two in July. So I joined forces with @waltmedling and together we filled up 2 boats with a bunch of lunatics from SF, LA, Denver, North Carolina, Sweden, and Germany. . It was a magical week full of sunshine, vino, Despacito, delicious food that you honestly couldn‚Äôt believe was made on a boat (shout out to the best hostess ever, @nicdymock), and basically no actual sailing because @d11egop is lazy. (just kidding, skipper! üòò) . Forever grateful for our crew and for the weird but unforgettable adventure. Love y‚Äôall and can‚Äôt wait to see many of you in T-minus one week! . And if the rest of you wanna have the best week of your life, check out @theyachtweek. . üì∑: @alex_broadstock + @matthieuklf

This year more than others has really seemed to fly by. I visited a dozen countries and countless cities, went back to a few of my favorites for round two (or three) and also discovered some new favorites, caught up with old friends all over the world and made many new ones, and was able to meet so many of you - both on here and in person! . And, since I‚Äôve been running around like a chicken with my head cutoff, I have what feels like a million photos left to share from this year‚Äôs adventures so I‚Äôm gonna do a bit of a recap. Starting with this: Bremen, Germany üíõ

A few weeks ago I was in Amsterdam taking photos for @afarmedia which led me to discover some awesome new stuff. Have you ever been to P.C. Hoofstraat street? It‚Äôs a beautiful shopping street full of mainly luxury stores but also cute cafes and restaurants. I thought this brick was amazing, especially in person when the sunlight hit it because it is translucent. Give it a visit next time you are in town!

I exclusively stay in hotels covered in ivy now üåø just kidding.. But they sure are pretty, no? The inside was just as beautiful (boho southwestern themed, reminded me of Santa Fe!) and the bed was so heavenly that I sat through the worst movie of all time voluntarily because I never wanted to get out.

Can't believe I never shared a pic from this amazing pool in Gothenburg, Sweden! It's at the Upper House Spa at Gothia Towers and hangs off the side of the building with epic views of Liseberg Amusement Park and the city.

Ever been jet boating? This pic looks oddly calm but really we were going up to 50 mph through narrow canyons, holding on like we were on a Disneyland ride while the driver randomly did 360 degree turns inches from the canyon walls.

‚ÄúPositano bites deep. It is a dream place that isn‚Äôt quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone. Its houses climb a hill so steep it would be a cliff except that stairs are cut in it. I believe that whereas most house foundations are vertical, in Positano they are horizontal. The small curving bay of unbelievably blue and green water laps gently on a beach of small pebbles. There is only one narrow street and it does not come down to the water. Everything else is stairs, some of them as steep as ladders. You do not walk to visit a friend, you either climb or slide.‚Äù -Steinbeck, Harper's Bazaar, 1953 üíõ

Once upon a time we picked fresh flowers from the garden at @slussenspensionat and made flower crowns in the most serene setting I've ever sat at. I shared some photos + more info on my West Sweden road trip with @volvocarusa, @westsweden @visitsweden_us and @flysas over on @iexploretravel's site.

Alberobello sunrise ‚òÄÔ∏è when we first arrived it was a tourist nightmare so I asked @tekwani if she wanted to get up at 6am to come back and thankfully she agreed. So much more enjoyable without the huge crowds!

Today I spent the day on the back of a scooter zipping around the picturesque Amalfi Coast towns (my favorite place on earth) with one of my favorite people, stopping to take a million photos and do some exploring along the way. I can't think of a more special way to end this month long adventure and I'm so thankful to have such truly wonderful people in my life ‚Äî old friends and new. #travelemotional üò¢

Puglia was just as dreamy as expected and I highly recommend a visit! There are so many cute towns to see and each is so different even when only 15 mins apart. I'm now en route to Positano so you can expect to see pics from there for the next 5 years (but what's new?!)

Last night I had dinner in a cave (you've seen it on Pinterest, I'd bet) and it was even more magical than you'd probably expect. I'm loving Puglia so much so far, especially Polignano A Mare where we're staying. Thanks for all of the recs @peppebozza!! There's more from this amazing spot on my story still from last night, if you hurry you can catch it! üì∑: my Insta bf @tekwani

It felt weird to wake up this morning in a real bed alone instead of on a boat with a dozen other people attached to three dozen other boats full of a dozen people. To say I'm sad that my favorite adventure has come to an end would be an understatement but I'm thankful to have two weeks in Mykonos, Santorini, Puglia, & Positano left on my agenda. Thank you for a week that I will never ever forget, my @theyachtweek fam! You lil pieces üòú

The prettiest breakfast views at @slussenspensionat in @westsweden after a little 6am kayaking üòç this place has the most beautiful location and delicious food but more importantly the people are absolute gems. Vibs, the hotel owner, graciously invited my mom and I to celebrate Midsummer with her family and friends and we had the most wonderful time. We made flower crowns, had traditional Midsummer lunch, and sang and danced all night to the live band (they have one every night). I miss it already and will definitely be back! Thanks for everything, guys. And special thanks to @mallyzachsweden for waking up at 5am to take me kayaking after being out till 3am eating hotdogs üòã! - #westsweden #visitswedenUS #visitsweden

I went to a few different museums while in West Sweden but The Nordic Watercolor Museum (@nordiskaakvarellmuseet) was my favorite. It's the only watercolor museum in all of Europe and is in the most beautiful location on the island of Tj√∂rn. Definitely worth the visit if you are in the area! - #westsweden #visitsweden http://liketk.it/2rQt7 #liketkit @liketoknow.it @cuyana

There is certainly no shortage of adorable flower shops in Gothenburg! This one was my favorite of them all. It's also conveniently located next to a coffee shop which also shares this courtyard. Not a bad place to refuel, yah? - #gothenburg #thisisgbg @goteborgcom @visitsweden_us

Day three of our West Sweden road trip with @volvocarusa and @westsweden brought us to the island of Marstrand.
