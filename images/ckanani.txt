Swinging into the week in Banff and out of it in London 🧡 we finally made it to Lake Louise last night and it was as beautiful as you all said! Also Lake Moraine is even more beautiful not at sunrise (odd, I know). Thanks @jessomewhere for giving me directions to this spot! It’s epic and we’ve already gone multiple times. 📸: @anchoredimage http://liketk.it/2wzNP #liketkit @liketoknow.it

We’re doing a good job of avoiding the crowds but still haven’t seen Lake Louise at all and Lake Moraine only at sunrise. On a scale from 1-10 how tragic is it if we don’t make it to Lake Louise?

Having sooo much fun in Chicago at @lakeshakefest! For those unfamiliar, it’s basically Stagecoach but with a better lineup in a more intimate and pretty venue. We’re both huuuuge country music fans and so many of our favs are here so it’s extra amazing 🍻. . Thanks so much for the passes, Lakeshake. And see you tonight, @coleswindell! . http://liketk.it/2wgUO #liketkit @liketoknow.it

Got a new post up on ckanani.com all about how you can visit Fly Geyser! This is one of the beautiful hot springs on the private Fly Ranch property. . I’m laughing because @lmonitz had just told me that I *am* awkward in photos. I do not like being in front of the camera and basically refuse to do fake candid things but luckily I have friends to make fun of me so that I laugh foreal instead! ;) . 📸: @nvkait (major bonus points to the @travelnevada team for basically all secretly being pro photographers on the side) . #DFMI #travelnevada

After Fly Ranch on Friday the @travelnevada team took us to check out a pottery studio/gallery also on their Burner Byway (Reno to the Black Rock Desert) itinerary. Since it’s totally off the grid (there’s not even power), it’s run mainly off of solar. . It was adorable and reminded me a lot of being home in Santa Fe where my dad grew up. Great place to pick up some gifts to bring home! . When you think of Nevada you likely think of Las Vegas or casinos and gambling, and that’s why I love trips like this so much. We get to uncover hidden gems and see things beyond the main tourist attractions (which are almost never something I’m into anyway). And then we get to share them with you! . #DFMI #travelnevada

I spent the majority of last week exploring western Nevada with @travelnevada. On Friday we got to check out Fly Geyser on Fly Ranch in the black rock desert, a private area owned by Burning Man. They recently opened up nature walks on the property to the public. . In addition to Fly Geyser which is unreal, the property has other awesome things like beautiful hot springs and this dock that is actually an art piece. . I highly recommend visiting and going on the walk if you find yourself in the area, it was one of my favorite parts of the trip! . #DFMI #travelnevada . http://liketk.it/2wbWG #liketkit @liketoknow.it

“If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody. Open your mind, get up off the couch, move.” — Anthony Bourdain. RIP :(

Rarely do I ever post an indoor photo, but I really loved this lounge area at @stayalfred in Nashville! I hit a bit of bad weather during my trip with the @opry and was glad to have such a beautiful area to get some work done when needing to hide from the rain for a bit ☺️

Yesterday morning I was looking through my Midsummer photos when I randomly got a FaceTime call from this guy + the @slussenspensionat crew saying, in part, that they had been doing the same. . I think that’s my favorite thing about travel (and something I often think about on the plane ride over)... You leave on an adventure not knowing what you’ll encounter or who you’ll meet. One minute you’re strangers, the next you’re far from it. . My mom snapped this probably 30 minutes into us meeting. If you’re sassy and fun I’ll love you immediately... bonus points if you’ll make flower crowns with me, be in a million photos, and wake up at 5am for an adventure. Such a special day at a truly wonderful place. . Thinking of all of you at @slussenspensionat ❤️ miss you and hope to see you soon!

This time last year we were driving New Zealand north to south during the “worst storm in generations” (on the opposite side of the road!), jumping backwards off waterfalls in dark caves, eating dried noodles out of vending machines (ew), and hiking every second we weren’t driving (or wine tasting). I think this is my “travel and adventures make me happy” face ☺️

The downside to this whole travel for a living thing is that I’ve been really bad about visiting family and friends like I used to do frequently. I’m so happy to have FINALLY actually booked a Hawai’i ticket after wayyyy too much time away. Can’t wait to celebrate @stephleilani and @nickwilkin11 (again). Your turn, @lizzybraun! 😜

Speaking of cute German villages, here’s Bremen. I went thinking it would be like Rothenburg.. but it was not 😬

Today I came back to my favorite fairytale town and it is just as wonderful as I remember it being 😍 I also went to Neuschwanstein Castle and to my grandpa’s hometown to say hey to my great grandpa, 2x great grandpa, and 3x great grandpa at the cemetery. Pretty successful Bavarian day!

The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is easily one of the most magnificent places I’ve ever been. Y’all should probably visit for this reason alone. Also @d11egop says the more covered I am, the better I look so I now exclusively post photos of myself from Dubai.

Fun fact: I’ve never owned a car. I actually have no interest in owning one but if I did I think it would be this. So cute and so much fun! But preferably in the yellow or teal colors - they just weren’t positioned well for a photograph so you’re stuck with this one 😂

Today I’m heading to Dubai and it’ll be the longest I’ve ever been on a plane for 😬 Anyone have good podcast recommendations? I need something to help pass the time, please!

Lisboa sure does sunsets well 😍 does anyone else struggle with wanting to go back to the same places over and over? Like I’m sure Spain is lovely but I can’t stop thinking about going back to Croatia, Italy, Sweden, Portugal...

Whoever said the coldest winter they ever spent was a summer in San Francisco obviously hadn’t been to the top of Glacier 3000 in Gstaad, Switzerland. I’m just glad @borderfreetravels flew her drone even though it warned her not to so that I can forever remember this -18° moment. . Fun fact: this is the world’s first suspension bridge spanning two summits. #inlovewithswitzerland

Ever hiked in freezing water for 5+ hours straight? Would you? I was convinced I would be cold and wet the entire time but guess what! I wasn’t. Even in winter. Even though we were in the shade 95% of the time. . My main takeaway from last weekend with @atozion and @travelmindset is that winter is *definitely* the best time to visit St. George. And I’ve got a new post up on ckanani.com breaking down all of the reasons why! . #instameetstgeorge

The Petrified Dunes at Snow Canyon in St. George are one of those places you see photos of and think it looks cool but in person is a whole different experience. When we arrived I snapped some pics and then sat down to watch the sunset and take it all in because it was kind of blowing my mind. @carradventure from @atozion said most people skip Snow Canyon and just go to @zionnps and after going I’m totally unclear as to why. If nothing else, at least stop by the Petrified Dunes when visiting! #instameetstgeorge

Golden hour at Zion ✨. . Had such a great weekend in St. George with @atozion and @travelmindset. We hiked the Narrows, Snow Canyon, Elephant Arch, and Canyon Overlook seen here! I learned that winter is definitely the time to go, as the weather is beautiful (we were in tank tops yesterday) and the crowds are small. . Have y’all been yet? . #instameetstgeorge

Warm sunshine and highs of 17 in SF feels a bit different than the lows of -18 over the past few weeks in Switzerland 😱 no time to enjoy it though cause I’m off to the next adventure tomorrow at 6am! Anyone else comin to the @travelmindset #InstaMeetStGeorge?!

QUESTION! Of all the adventures we went on with @myswitzerland, which was your favorite or the one you’d most like to do? -Tobogganing in Zermatt -Hot air balloon ride in Chateau-d’Oex -Fondue hike in Gstaad -Dog sled ride in Gstaad -Glacier 3000 (that huge crazy suspension bridge) in Gstaad -Sledging to Grindelwald -Cliff Walk in Jungfrau Region -First flyer/glider in Jungfrau Region -The spa at @victoriajungfrau in Interlaken (ha) . I got so many replies about the various excursions but I’m curious overall which was everyone’s favorite! #inlovewithswitzerland . PS. My story is saved to my highlights if you need a refresher on any of those things ☺️

I first visited @myinterlaken and @jungfrauregion five or so years ago and had such a wonderful time that it has held a spot in my “favorite places of all time” list ever since. When @borderfreetravels and I started planning this trip with @myswitzerland it immediately came to mind as a place I’d like to include in the itinerary, especially because I had never been in winter and Kristen had never visited at all. . Over the last few days I have been happy to discover that it is equally as wonderful in winter and still full of so many fun adventures! Yesterday we went to the top of Jungfraujoch which was a tad bit colder than it was last time when I went in July 😉 We then got sledges and spent 2-3 hours sledding down the mountain into Grindelwald, stopping every so often for photos and a hot drink or two.  You can catch the video on my story still if you’re quick - it was honestly such a blast.  Then today we went up to First to do the Cliff Walk you see in the photo! It was a bit scary but honestly incredible as only us and the mountain peaks were above the clouds. . The region is very popular so I would not be surprised if many of you have visited already, but if you haven’t yet checked it out in winter I would definitely suggest doing so!

I fell in love with Switzerland in 1996 during my first visit and have continued to love it more and more with each trip. Yesterday when we arrived in Gstaad I knew almost immediately that I had found a new Swiss love, one that I’ll be talking about for years to come and visiting again and again. It’s filled with so much charm and character making even a 15 minute stroll down the car-free village center a treat. . It’s been a little over 24 hours since we arrived and I don’t think I’ve stopped smiling since, despite only getting 4 hours of sleep. After a winter hike with a fondue backpack to make fondue with in the middle of the alps, dog sledding in the early morn with the sweetest pups, and a jaw-dropping afternoon crossing a suspension bridge in -18 degree weather, I can’t imagine what else we could uncover if we had more time here. Luckily there is one thing I know for sure, and that is that I’ll be back ❤️. . #inlovewithswitzerland #charminggstaad #gstaad #comeupslowdown #alpineauthenticity

Yesterday we said goodbye to Zermatt after a wonderful 4 nights and made our way to Pays-d’Enhaut. We’re here for Château-d’Oex’s 40th International Hot Air Balloon Festival which we kicked off last night with the Night Glow (a display of fireworks and glowing balloons to choreographed music). This morn we’re going to ride in a hot air balloon (my first!) and later we head to Gstaad for a fondue hike! Oh and they speak French here so thank goodness I am 2% fluent.

February is Seattle Museum Month which means if you book a room at participating hotels you get a museum pass for half-price tickets at 40 museums.

This trip to Lisbon was the first time I’ve ever gone to a city in Europe and stayed put for longer than a week. Since I had visited before and had so much time it was awesome not to feel pressured to run around 24/7. Now I want to go somewhere else and stay for a full month! What’s the longest you’ve stayed somewhere and where was it?

Remember when it was summer? Can we go back to that yet?

Alright, you can officially add Lisbon to the list of places you’ll be seeing on my feed forever. Looking for recommendations? There’s a new post up on ckanani.com about the best places to grab coffee in Lisboa!

Tell me something about yourself! - A bit of fun fact overload today but @the_flyaway_girl is insisting that I obey her request so here are 10 random get-to-know-me facts: - 1. Most of my friends call me ‘cks’ (my initials) 2. I have loved photography my whole life and I shoot @canonusa because my grandpa did 3. I’m super uncomfortable on the other side of the camera, but I’m trying to change that! 4. I love music soo much and have a @spotify playlist for *everything*. I also know the lyrics to basically every song 5. I drink iced coffee year round, no matter how cold out it is 6. I do not count countries and have no idea how many I’ve been to. I’d rather just go where I want to go.. i.e. Italy over and over and over and over 7. I prefer off the beaten path places 8. I’m a proud Virgo and loveeeee fellow (crazy, neurotic) Virgos! 9. I’m horrible with makeup so instead I have a serious (and expensive) skincare addiction. My fav is @skinceuticals, plus @larocheposayusa, @skii, @skinmedica, and newly @laneige_us! 10. I reallyyyy love podcasts, especially @wrongfulconviction (@itsjasonflom is such a gem), @theladygang (@keltie is insane but my spirit animal), & @themorningbreath (the most prestigious morning show around). Also anything @ashley_iaconetti is on - What about you? Tell me a fun fact! And fav skincare brand? Fav podcast? Are you a Virgo?! - PS. For everyone asking for more deets on the @taylorswift run in in my story, I’ll drop it in a story soon! Too long to type!

Today it rained all day but last night’s golden hour was one for the books (and the Instagram feed) 💕

Today is quite rainy so I decided to get some work done while also cafe hopping (one of many blogposts coming soon!). This is @fabricacoffeeroasters on one of my favorite streets in the city, R. das Flores, which is also home to my favorite restaurant @tabernadasflores. Although after last night’s meal at @a_cevicheria_chefkiko I might have a new fav... Tough call! . What’s on your agenda this weekend? I am looking forward to some sunshine! ☀️

Havin’ so much fun kicking off 2018 in Amsterdam! Except it is FREEZING so thank goodness for my dear friend @canadagoose. But how will I survive Switzerland if I am already cold in Amsterdam? 🤔 send help.

Last but not least, my very favorite @westsweden day was Midsummer (of course)! . We spent it at picturesque @slussenspensionat on the island of Orust where Vibs (the owner) and her family very graciously invited us to celebrate with them. We: — Picked fresh flowers from the garden and made our own midsummer flower crowns (midsommarkrans) — Danced and sang around the midsummer pole in the rain — Had traditional homemade midsummer lunch with Vibs, her family and close friends. There was a lot of singing and toasting and drinking some crazy drink that tasted like pure alcohol 😂 so much fun — Had fresh muscles for dinner at @slussenspensionat. So fresh that I could see from the table where they were caught! — Sang and danced yet again all night to the live band. Even my mom stayed out past 2am! — Picked 7 different types of flowers at 2 or 3am in the dark and in the rain to put under my pillow (another Swedish tradition). Whoever I dreamed about was supposed to be my future partner but @harrystyles still hasn’t called — Got up at 5am to kayak, searching for seals! Didn’t see any seals but we angered a lot of birds and had a blast . Everyone at @slussenspensionat (and in West Sweden in general, actually) was SO SWEET to us and made us feel like we were a part of the family. So many people we met said they come back every single year and I can definitely see why! Thanks again for having us 💛

After Gothenburg we took our @volvocarusa on a @westsweden road trip.  These are all from the islands of Tjörn and Marstrand. . Fun facts/tips: — There are over 8,000 islands in West Sweden — On Tjörn there is a watercolor museum (@nordiskaakvarellmuseet) and an outdoor sculpture park (@pilaneheritage). Both are awesome — Tjörn is home to Sweden’s first floating hotel Salt & Sill. The restaurant there is amazing as are the views. @voguemagazine recommends it too — I still have no idea how to say “Tjörn” — Marstrand is incredibly charming and so small that you can easily walk around the perimeter — The best Marstrand views are from Carlsten Fortress.  Our hotel @marstrandshavshotell gave us a lunch pack to take to the top for a picnic!  It was, of course, lovely

Of all the new places you visited in 2017, which was your favorite?  Most of you answered my poll question wrong - mine was West Sweden! . I went in partnership with @visitsweden_us, @goteborgcom, @westsweden, @flysas, and @volvocarusa and it was magical ✨ Why? Let’s start with Gothenburg: — It was sunny everyday, with 18+ hours of daylight — The food was amazing.  Fresh, healthy, and mostly seafood and veggies (i.e. my favs). Gothenburg alone has 7 Michelin-starred restaurants — Everything was gorgeous. The shops, cafes, restaurants, parks, streets - all absolutely beautiful and a photographer’s dream — There was soo much to see and do. I was in Gothenburg for 5 full days and that wasn’t nearly enough — They graciously allowed me to invite a +1 so I brought my mom. We hadn’t been to Europe together since 1996 so it was extra special

Another 2017 highlight — Manchester! . In May I went to Manchester with @virginatlantic and @visitmanchester in honor of Virgin launching a new direct flight there from SF. My trip was full of the most adorable (Instagrammable) restaurants and bars, a lot of soccer/football, the cutest British facades, my new favorite market (@altymarket), and, of course, music! I also got to meet some of my fav Insta friends in person finally (@vagabond3, @lifeasjenn) plus make some new ones. . It is a wonderful city and only 2 hours by train from London so definitely check it out. And if you’re from SF also, you can now fly there direct with @virginatlantic 😎 #sponsored

Back to the 2017 travel highlight reel! In April we spent a few weeks road tripping from the top of New Zealand all the way down to Queenstown, doing casual things like jumping backwards off waterfalls in pitch black caves and running from Cyclone Cook (the worst storm in decades). . Some takeaways: —As expected, I liked the South Island a lot more —You should definitely not speed anywhere in New Zealand —Wanaka and Queenstown are especially awesome —Luging is more fun than it sounds! —People weren’t lying about the Roy’s Peak hike being boring beyond words —Driving on the other side of the road feels natural and is not at all scary —The glow worm caves are actually not a tourist trap if you see them via an adventure with @legendaryblackwaterraftingco —And most importantly, New Zealand is really not that far. @airnz flights leave SF at night, you eat dinner, watch a movie, go to sleep, and then you wake up in Auckland. 13 hours direct. Go visit.

A one-of-a-kind champagne themed suite with 270 degree views of America’s prettiest city and enough room to host 20 people? If this isn’t #hotelgoals, I honestly don’t know what is.

Nothing beats San Francisco in December (or ever). And this rooftop garden at the @fairmontsanfrancisco is a wonderful spot to take in some sun, we discovered! #fairmontmoments

What do you guys think of @fairmontsanfrancisco so far? I don’t think I’ve ever gotten more replies to my stories in my life, so it definitely seems like you’re a fan! . I had so much fun yesterday at holiday gingerbread tea in their Laurel Court Restaurant & Bar and also in the jaw dropping Sparkle Suite. It’s hard to believe it could get any better but tonight I am switching to the Santa Suite and cannot wait. . What’s the Santa Suite? Oh it’s just the suite Santa stays in when he visits SF, decked out in holiday decor. There’s a candy and hot chocolate bar (adult beverages included), a gingerbread house kit, and a selection of classic holiday movies. And they kindly invited my sister @stephleilani and 5 year old niece to join me so they’re on a plane en route right now! MAGICAL. . If you want to see the Sparkle Suite with 270 degrees views of SF and room for 20 people (whaaat?), hop on over to my story! ✨ #fairmontmoments

Today I am super excited to be kicking off a fun project with the beautiful @fairmontsanfrancisco! For those that aren’t familiar, it is remarkable year round but especially during the holidays thanks to its world famous, two story, life-sized gingerbread house (among many other things). I heard it’s even bigger than last year’s! . I’ll be checking in for a few days, along with some special guests of mine, so make sure to keep up with my story - I have a feeling it’s going to be pretty magical ✨🎄❤️ #fairmontmoments

After @theyachtweek in July I spent a week in Mykonos and Santorini where I did really fun things like go to the hospital because there are no doctors on the island 😋... . All jokes aside though, they are both absolutely beautiful but a little too touristy (and overpriced) for my liking. I strongly recommend Hydra or something else instead!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3dbcdbad1a6c0d8c4d955d84f024a578/5BCB154F/t51.2885-15/e35/25008231_136048180357149_4806209395115425792_n.jpg
Easily one of my favorite weeks of 2017 💛 There is truly nothing like living on a small boat with a bunch of friends, sailing around one of the most beautiful countries in the world (Greece). . After loving @theyachtweek Croatia last summer, @lizzybraun and I decided we were brave enough to go back for round two in July. So I joined forces with @waltmedling and together we filled up 2 boats with a bunch of lunatics from SF, LA, Denver, North Carolina, Sweden, and Germany. . It was a magical week full of sunshine, vino, Despacito, delicious food that you honestly couldn’t believe was made on a boat (shout out to the best hostess ever, @nicdymock), and basically no actual sailing because @d11egop is lazy. (just kidding, skipper! 😘) . Forever grateful for our crew and for the weird but unforgettable adventure. Love y’all and can’t wait to see many of you in T-minus one week! . And if the rest of you wanna have the best week of your life, check out @theyachtweek. . 📷: @alex_broadstock + @matthieuklf

This year more than others has really seemed to fly by. I visited a dozen countries and countless cities, went back to a few of my favorites for round two (or three) and also discovered some new favorites, caught up with old friends all over the world and made many new ones, and was able to meet so many of you - both on here and in person! . And, since I’ve been running around like a chicken with my head cutoff, I have what feels like a million photos left to share from this year’s adventures so I’m gonna do a bit of a recap. Starting with this: Bremen, Germany 💛

I spent 2 weeks in Greece in July and just went through my photos from there for the first time this weekend. Does that ever happen to you guys? Too many photos, too little time!

A few weeks ago I was in Amsterdam taking photos for @afarmedia which led me to discover some awesome new stuff. Have you ever been to P.C. Hoofstraat street? It’s a beautiful shopping street full of mainly luxury stores but also cute cafes and restaurants. I thought this brick was amazing, especially in person when the sunlight hit it because it is translucent. Give it a visit next time you are in town!

Happy Thanksgiving! What are you thankful for? I’m thankful to be able to travel the world more than most, for my health, and for my wonderful family and friends. And Instagram!  Who would’ve thought making internet friends turned real life friends would become such a normal thing to do? Also family time is hard, so good luck today!

I exclusively stay in hotels covered in ivy now 🌿 just kidding.. But they sure are pretty, no? The inside was just as beautiful (boho southwestern themed, reminded me of Santa Fe!) and the bed was so heavenly that I sat through the worst movie of all time voluntarily because I never wanted to get out.

“Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down.” —Oprah I’m thankful this thanksgiving week and every week to have the best friends a gal could ask for, like @lizzybraun! ❤️

I can officially confirm that, in addition to summer and winter, Paris is lovely in the fall. I guess I’ll have to take one for the team and go back during spring to find out how it is then too ;)

Last weekend in beautiful Copenhagen. I had so much fun exploring the city for the second time and I even went upside down on a roller coaster for the first time! So adventurous (and so much for motion sickness?) 🤪

This pic goes against basically everything my feed is: it’s dark, it’s indoors, and it’s a horrible quality iPhone pic that we took ourselves at a concert. But it’s real life and one of the things that make me happiest - my wonderful friends ☺️ And sometimes I get tired of the curated madness that is Insta these days. Anyone else? . PS. Miss you excessively, @janelleg3

You sure are pretty, Amsterdam! Have you been keeping up with my stories? I’ve been getting an unusually high amount of love on them, so you should probably do that ASAP. 😇

I got a ton of questions from you guys when I posted videos from this restaurant in my story the other day, so I answered all of them in a new blogpost on ckanani.com!  Go check it out if you're also wondering if it's worth it or if it's a tourist trap ☺️

Can't believe I never shared a pic from this amazing pool in Gothenburg, Sweden! It's at the Upper House Spa at Gothia Towers and hangs off the side of the building with epic views of Liseberg Amusement Park and the city. The floor of it is transparent so you can see the cars driving below! If that's not for you there are also numerous *indoor* pools and saunas ☺️ definitely worth a visit if you're in Gothenburg!

Ever been jet boating? This pic looks oddly calm but really we were going up to 50 mph through narrow canyons, holding on like we were on a Disneyland ride while the driver randomly did 360 degree turns inches from the canyon walls. Pretty fun! And a good alternative to bungee jumping in Queenstown if you're too big of a wuss like I am.

“Positano bites deep. It is a dream place that isn’t quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone. Its houses climb a hill so steep it would be a cliff except that stairs are cut in it. I believe that whereas most house foundations are vertical, in Positano they are horizontal. The small curving bay of unbelievably blue and green water laps gently on a beach of small pebbles. There is only one narrow street and it does not come down to the water. Everything else is stairs, some of them as steep as ladders. You do not walk to visit a friend, you either climb or slide.” -Steinbeck, Harper's Bazaar, 1953 💛

When y'all travel do you visit the same places again or stick to new ones? My friend mentioned wanting us to go to Amsterdam and ever since I've been dreaming of this... but there's also so many more places to explore!

Today I spent the day on the back of a scooter zipping around the picturesque Amalfi Coast towns (my favorite place on earth) with one of my favorite people, stopping to take a million photos and do some exploring along the way. I can't think of a more special way to end this month long adventure and I'm so thankful to have such truly wonderful people in my life — old friends and new. #travelemotional 😢

Early mornings roaming around Alberobello with a camera & @tekwani are high on my list of things I love 💛 can I just stay forever?!

Pretty little Puglia 💛 I could've walked around here for days
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a22ecd3d5035af01cc81c4eb7ce1fa52/5BD098F7/t51.2885-15/e35/21295177_497575117244173_6733479461280284672_n.jpg
Puglia was just as dreamy as expected and I highly recommend a visit! There are so many cute towns to see and each is so different even when only 15 mins apart. I'm now en route to Positano so you can expect to see pics from there for the next 5 years (but what's new?!)

Last night I had dinner in a cave (you've seen it on Pinterest, I'd bet) and it was even more magical than you'd probably expect. I'm loving Puglia so much so far, especially Polignano A Mare where we're staying. Thanks for all of the recs @peppebozza!! There's more from this amazing spot on my story still from last night, if you hurry you can catch it! 📷: my Insta bf @tekwani

I think I'll just move in here.

Earlier today in Santorini 🇬🇷

Mykonos 🇬🇷 I'm ill so I'm out of clever captions but here's a pretty pic of Mykonos Town

It felt weird to wake up this morning in a real bed alone instead of on a boat with a dozen other people attached to three dozen other boats full of a dozen people. To say I'm sad that my favorite adventure has come to an end would be an understatement but I'm thankful to have two weeks in Mykonos, Santorini, Puglia, & Positano left on my agenda. Thank you for a week that I will never ever forget, my @theyachtweek fam! You lil pieces 😜

Pretty little Marstrand last weekend 💛 this weekend I'm busy trying to get a million things done before I head to Greece and Italy for a month. Anyone have fun 4th of July plans that don't involve working or packing? :) - #westsweden #visitswedenUS #visitsweden

The prettiest breakfast views at @slussenspensionat in @westsweden after a little 6am kayaking 😍 this place has the most beautiful location and delicious food but more importantly the people are absolute gems. Vibs, the hotel owner, graciously invited my mom and I to celebrate Midsummer with her family and friends and we had the most wonderful time. We made flower crowns, had traditional Midsummer lunch, and sang and danced all night to the live band (they have one every night). I miss it already and will definitely be back! Thanks for everything, guys. And special thanks to @mallyzachsweden for waking up at 5am to take me kayaking after being out till 3am eating hotdogs 😋! - #westsweden #visitswedenUS #visitsweden

I went to a few different museums while in West Sweden but The Nordic Watercolor Museum (@nordiskaakvarellmuseet) was my favorite. It's the only watercolor museum in all of Europe and is in the most beautiful location on the island of Tjörn. Definitely worth the visit if you are in the area! - #westsweden #visitsweden http://liketk.it/2rQt7 #liketkit @liketoknow.it @cuyana

There is certainly no shortage of adorable flower shops in Gothenburg! This one was my favorite of them all. It's also conveniently located next to a coffee shop which also shares this courtyard. Not a bad place to refuel, yah? - #gothenburg #thisisgbg @goteborgcom @visitsweden_us

I truly had such an amazing time exploring Gothenburg and West Sweden last week in partnership with @goteborgcom, @westsweden, @visitsweden_us, @volvocarusa and @flysas! I had a feeling that I would love it but it was even better than I expected. I'm sad to be home and already want to go back to see more! Who's coming with?! 😊🇸🇪- - #gothenburg #thisisgbg #westsweden #visitsweden #volvooverseasdelivery #flysas #sponsored

Day three of our West Sweden road trip with @volvocarusa and @westsweden brought us to the island of Marstrand. It was an absolutely beauuutiful day and I'm sure you'll be shocked to hear that I LOVE it here. You are pretty wonderful, West Sweden 😍🇸🇪! - #westsweden #visitsweden #volvooverseasdelivery

I stumbled upon this street en route to Café Kronhuset and of course loved it because it has colorful buildings + colorful flags. So many hidden gems here in Gothenburg. I need more time!! - #gothenburg #thisisgbg #westsweden

I love Gothenburg and am so glad my mama finally arrived so that we can explore together! Maybe I can even stop taking selfies now? 😜. PS. Thanks for all the love on my stories. Glad so many of you are enjoying seeing beautiful West Sweden! - #gothenburg #thisisgbg #westsweden

Before coming to Gothenburg I heard it had amazing restaurants but I didn't realize they'd be great AND look like this 😍 you already know I died/wanted to move in/took 3 million pics/etc. - #gothenburg #thisisgbg #westsweden

I spent the day exploring Gothenburg with @goteborgcom and it is even more beautiful than I imagined! This is the Palm House in the Garden Society of Gothenburg. It's a giant greenhouse built in 1878 and is absolutely to die for. I've already been twice and haven't even been in Sweden for 24 hours 😂 More on my first day in Gothenburg in my story if you haven't checked it out yet! - #gothenburg #thisisgbg #westsweden #sponsored

Picture-perfect sunrise over Lake Wanaka ☀️ the locals will tell you that hiking Roy's Peak is no big deal, but to be honest it's actually pretty hard. Worth it, though!

One of three swinging suspension bridges along the Hooker Valley track in Mount Cook National Park. I thought they were pretty fun but couldn't stop thinking about how my sister @stephleilani would be dying 😂
