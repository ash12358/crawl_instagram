Pause for the cause during my seminar on blackface in Japan at TBS television
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cc8aacf26e29255bba60ef0d374edb4f/5BCD2443/t51.2885-15/e35/36573750_792544234467999_3359105776311336960_n.jpg
I'd been planning this presentation to the staff at TBS television on Blackface in Japan (as well as other stereotyping and commodifying of non-Japanese in the media here, and why Japanese media should take a serious look at this practice) for weeks, and today was the BIG day! I brought my new intern Nina along to assist, and together I think we got the job done and then some. At least if my read of people here is in any way accurate we did. Staff from every department attended and asked poignant questions in the Q&A that followed. All-in-all, it was Fab! Didn't record it, cuz it wasn't for public use, only for their private use. But I'm thinking about doing the presentation for the public this summer. If anyone is interested in attending such a presentation by yours truly let me know. I think y'all would dig it!

My 我慢 gaman face. Years of Living in a country where confronting people directly or resolving conflict with vibrant debate / enthusiastic argument (things I relished back in the states) will likely cause you to be further shunned, has molded this look onto my face in moments when confrontations would otherwise be called for. It demonstrates a level of self-restraint tinged with a solemn calmness that suggests it didn’t require every morsel of energy and goodwill at my disposal to pull off. That’s gaman (patience) to me. I deserve an Oscar (-:

Yappari Convo with my coworker regarding today’s revelations about Einstein... Me: did you see this? It’s in the nytimes on bbc, all over. Coworker: what happened? Me: Einstein apparently was a racist. CW: really? Wow. He didn’t like black people? That’s terrible. Me: actually he was cool with blacks. CW: oh! I thought you said he was racist... Me: he was, but not against blacks. According to his diary it seems he had some racist ideas about Asians. CW: eeee?? Uso!! (You gotta be kidding!) Me: yep. Apparently he wrote some pretty nasty stuff about Chinese. CW: Chinese? Me: yeah, thinks they’re filthy and obtuse and spiritless... CW: the Chinese? Yappari! (no surprise there!) Me: .... CW: but not the Japanese? Me:.... CW: what? Me: he actually had nothing but great things to say about Japanese. CW: really? Me: yeah... CW: what did he say? Me: don’t worry. It was really good. I’m sure it’ll be all over your news tonight. Baye McNeil PS: give me strength...

From reader: "Baye, I read your facebook post every day and they are the highlight of my day. They're insightful and often kind of funny, in a "dark" way (no pun intended). I can get a laugh and learn something every time, and that's rare for me. But sometimes I wonder how, and why, do you do it." Thanks Yo! Glad you dig my work.  What can I say? You know how some people go to the gym every day to work on their pecs and abs and flexibility and what not? It's kinda like that. Your mind is like a muscle. Don't work it and it's sure to get flabby on you. I'm sure you know a few flabby-minded people. And writing is one way to exercise your mind...I want a six-pack up there, if you know what I mean, so I workout everyday! And you know how some people like to workout on the beach? Well, I exercise in public, too. And if by chance I inspire others to workout by doing so, well that's all the better. Everybody's got their thing. That's mine. God knows I ain't got a six-pack in my mid section, and I can't do yoga without passing gas or passing out, but I'm pumping iron up top! (-; Peace and Love, Baye McNeil www.bayemcneil.com

The McNeil Brand Conversation with my student. We were discussing his difficulties finding a Japanese wife: Me: ...Well, I’m sure there’s gotta be one out there. You’re a handsome guy making a great living…you’ll find her, if you’re lucky. Student: yeah, I need to find her soon so i can have a son to carry on my family name. That’s very important in Japan. Me: Other places too. Student: in America do you need sons to carry the family name? Me: Yeah, usually. I don’t worry about it though. Student: Really? Black people don’t care about that? Me: Some do, some don’t. Student:… Me: Well, America has a complicated history…especially with this name business. Student: Oh? Me: McNeil is a European name, Scottish, or Irish, I forget. It was the name of the white man that owned my great grandfather... and likely raped my great grandmother as light skinned as my father was. Blacks in America were considered property and were generally stripped of their original African names and given the owner’s names...and most of us still have this slave branding til this day. Student: I see. Wow! Me: yeah...So, I’d like to have a child someday but this slave name has nothing to do with it.  I couldn’t care less if it disappeared from the face of the earth… Student: (frowning) That’s sad. Me: Kinda…but sadder would be if I didn’t know history and just went through my life ignorant of what I was holding sacred. You know? Student: Yeah...i feel strange calling you  Mcneil-San now. Me: Don’t worry about it. Kinda used to the brand now. But you can call me Baye. Baye McNeil www.bayemcneil.com

A little Bit... (The following conversation took place at a cafe in Yokohama between myself and a private student) Student: How are you? Me: I’m ok. My back hurts a little, though. And you? Student:I have ummm 肩こり. You know what that is? Me: Like a stiff shoulder? Student: Yes. Japanese get this kind of pain often. Do Americans get 肩こり too? Me: … (waiting for a sign she is pulling my leg…none was forthcoming) Student: You know, a pain in this area… (she shows me her shoulder blades) Me: Are you serious? ( I didn't shake my head. But I think I might have shaken my head with my eyes?) Student: Eeeee? Me: Sorry…ummm, yes Americans get stiff shoulders, too. Student: What? Was that a strange question？ Me: A little bit. Student: A little bit? Really? Me: Well, (I point to the glass of water on the table) imagine if I said Americans like ice water. Do Japanese like ice water, too? Would you think it was a strange question? Student:... Me: A little bit, right? Student: Haha...yeah, a little bit. Baye McNeil www.bayemcneil.com

Twice in one day I’ve been referred to with the prefix “the great” after having never been referred to with that phrase ever. Freaking me out just a little, I gotta say. Then I look in the mirror (actually my iPhone) to see who they talking about and I see this guy. And I think: “these grays are starting to look becoming. maybe it’s time to go ‘Morgan Freeman’ out this mofo’” (like I have a choice...no more sprinkles of salt these days. More salt than pepper) lol But thanks guys. I’m just me doing my job. #blackeyejapan

A Vessel Called 黒人 One of my Japanese students asked me today when Japanese refer to me as a 黒人(black) or to white people as 白人 how does it make me feel. It was an excellent question, and I appreciated being asked because it revealed a conscientiousness necessary to have such a conversation.Something that doesn't happen overnight. We've known each other for quite a while now, and have established the trust required to speak freely about such things I used to feel ill at ease answering such complexed race questions because I was unsure myself how I felt so was afraid that I might upset the listener by getting myself all worked up,  which doesn't augur well for a promising exchange. I had to learn, mostly by trial and error, how to talk to people, not to mention how to write about it. To paraphrase my answer, I said: "I feel invisible. The person that uses those terms doesn't actually see me. They see the image in their minds filed under 黒人. A collection of hearsay and stereotypes and pure imagination and hogwash. The individual before them, me, is just a vessel for this image. A vessel called 黒人. "The truth that gets avoided is that we know absolutely nothing about other people based on skin color. Nothing. Without an actual effort to learn who I am, to see how my humanity distinguishes me from the humanity of others they've known, you're left with the choice of labeling me arbitrarily or taking social shortcuts based on skin color. That's what i feel when I hear 黒人. I feel the person has taken a shortcut that often veers off into an unbecoming place. "But I get it. The long way is メンドクサイ！Way too much trouble...especially since most people are not even aware that they've taken a shortcut. Many people do believe that race is an indicator of at least some characteristics and predilections. Besides, most people who do it do not mean any harm by doing so. But that doesn't make it any less harmful. So, yeah, when I hear 黒人I think, "here is a person contributing to the ugliest attribute of humanity and isn't even aware of it." And each time I have to decide whether or not to say something or just accept the labeling, and all that comes with it.”

This morning... Me: ohayo gozaimasu Japanese teacher: good morning! Me: why do you always answer my Japanese in English? JT: huh? Me: you know you do that, right? JT: I just want you to feel comfortable, like you’re home. Me: home? You mean in New York? JT: yes! Me: we’ve been working together for several years now. Right? And I’ve been living in Japan longer than every Japanese student in this school... JT: wow. That’s true. Me: so when does Yokohama become my home? Or am I forever a tourist? JT: I never thought about it that way.  I just thought...I dunno. Me: I appreciate your intention to make me feel comfortable. I really do.  But I’d appreciate it a little more if you made me feel at home...here in my home. JT: すみません、これから日本語を—-ペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラペラ Me: sorry could you repeat that in English? JT: hahahahaha😂

In the wake of the allegations against Junot Diaz, I’ve been getting a lot of messages from you guys asking all kinds of questions. So I just want to address them here. I’ve hung out with Junot several times on his visits to Japan. He was impressed with my activism here and my writings and of course the feeling was mutual. He was very encouraging and even gave advice. I think of him as a role model for success in the industry. We’ve kicked it about writing and the publishing industry and about teaching and what not.  He’s as charismatic as his writing. He is his writing. When I heard about his mistreatment and assaults and verbal abuse of women and the other allegations against him I was appalled. Last time we met he seemed very much in love. In fact he was with his gf at the time. The three of us hung out together.  But I know for a fact that many men of all stations in life are capable of such harmfulness to women, particularly but not limited to men with power and influence, so in no way was I completely surprised by this. I’ve long since recognized how misogyny is damn near a birthright for men, truth be told, embraced and encouraged often without it being fully acknowledged for what it is. Myself included. I like to think that being raised in a community replete with women of strength and courage and intelligence and power and respectability provided me with a sort of immunization against this affliction. But, misogyny is ever present, and it’s the rare man who is completely unaffected by it. #MeToo is only scratching the surface so far. This shit has levels and it’s deeply embedded. So to Junot, as is the case with another man whose writing awed me, Woody Allen, and another man I idolized Bill Cosby, and the many others, caught and Yet to be called out, get help! And to the women, our mothers and sisters and daughters, victimized by these men, know that my support for you is wholehearted and unwavering. I think it’s key for all men, considering how many of us are afflicted with at least the trait that can result in a Junot or a Cosby, that actively supporting #metoo is one way to strengthen your resistance to this affliction. Speak up!! Get involved!!

Apologies are distracting. You can apologize for these incidents but the pathology that results in these incidents is what really needs to continue to be addressed. Last year didn’t Starbucks want their staff to talk about race? Smh. But that was closer to dealing with the pathology. Don’t blame Philadelphia. Don’t blame Starbucks. And please Don’t blame Trump. 🤔 a child is afraid of the dark. Do you blame the dark? Demand an apology from the dark? let’s turn on the light.

April 2004, I stepped off that JAL flight from NY to Tokyo at Narita Airport and began this, now, 14 year adventure in Japan. If some soothsayer had told me where it would take me at that point -- that I wouldn't be returning to the US as a resident, that I would become an internationally-known blogger, critically acclaimed author and noted columnist, that I would be sought for speaking engagements at events nationwide, conduct workshops at major companies on diversity in the workplace, lecture at the top universities on race and diversity issues, spearhead protests and demonstrations, be sought by major Japanese publications and international media as a representative voice of people of African descent in Asia as a whole, as a leader of anything at all, really -- I would have just smiled and said, "yeah, right! Go sell your dreams to someone else." My tenure here hasn't been all "dreamy" but it has been the adventure of a lifetime, and more than I could have asked for. Just wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of my friends, acquaintances, partners and companions, the world over, who have supported me throughout this journey, to thank Japan for allowing me to share my ideas (and not tossing me out of the country on my ass), and to give my love to Japanese people (not all of you but you know who you are) for showing me all the love I needed to persevere through some rather loveless times. Most of all, big love to The Creator for vesting me with certain qualities that made this all possible, in particular the gift of the written word, and to my mother for not giving me too much hell for deciding to stay abroad for as long as I have, and blessing me with a smile, her smile, and the keys to maintaining it against substantial odds. Love, Baye. #yokohama #locohama #blackeye #japan

Haiti’s No Shithole, You Shithead!! (Me visiting Haiti for 3 weeks in 2002 - excerpt from a piece I wrote on the trip)  Joy, envy, and sorrow overwhelmed me at once and tears rolled down my cheeks. While I waved (I've yal or superior firepower. I wept for the dignity shamefully absent in many African-Americans because our integral role in American history has been under taught, misrepresented, or altogether obliterated just for that purpose. But, most of all I wept because I'd never before felt so free from the legacy of slavery, nor so much pride in my blackness, as I did at that moment. I owe Ayiti (Haiti, in Kreyol) a debt of gratitude for this souvenir- one that won't collect dust on a mantelpiece, but reside in my soul forever. Merci anpil, Ayiti cherie!

Well, it's now the number 1 story on Yahoo Japan, which means it's national and has a good chance of being picked up globally! Not sure how that'll pan out but regardless, this is huge! Anyway, big props to all my friends, of all colors and nationalities, who have supported this effort over the past couple of days,(and throughout) retweeting, sharing and discussing this #blackface issue. Let's hope that some positive changes can result from all our efforts. But, even if it doesn't, we have shown and proved that our voices, the voices of people wanting to live in a more tolerant world, can and will be heard!

Open Letter to Black People Tolerant of Blackface in Japan: Dear Black Blackface Supporters: Over the past 48 hours, since this most recent blackface incident occurred, I have been told by several of you (mostly guys) in so many words, that you are not supportive of addressing this nor reducing occurences of it in the future, mainly because it's a non-issue for you. I respect your position (damn that was hard to write) but I think you're wrong, obviously. While I'm well aware that black people are not a monolith by any means, the sad reality is, as long as we have black people actively speaking out against efforts to reduce blackface, our efforts will likely always be thwarted. The sharks will smell that divisive blood in the water and race towards it. (And I'm watching this happen in Real Time on SNS as I type these words, which has prompted this request) and some of the Japanese on the fence on this issue will hop down on the wrong side of it. Your side of it. So, you've decided that blackface is something that need not be addressed. You've tacitly joined ranks with the likes of White supremacists, apologists and legions of 2-channel-ers...not to mention Hamada-san, Rat & Stars and others who don blackface for profit. So be it!  that's your prerogative, of course. But, must you also undermine "our" efforts as well? And yes by leaving a comment that this is a non-issue raised by oversensitive whining ass black people looking to make something out of nothing, you are indeed undermining our efforts. ("Our" in this case meaning not only the blacks and whites who are against blackface, but the Japanese people as well who want to see change in their lifetimes in this regard.) As I've said, there are thousands. Thousands signed the petition 2 years ago and thousands are retweeting my criticisms of this practice as I type these words. And if JAPAN (not us) decides that Blackface is a type of entertainment they will no longer tolerate (because of its negative ramifications) then again you stand to benefit, regardless of whether you agree it impacts your life or not. And if you tolerate it because you actually like blackface, well here’s a T-shirt for ya! B

Kujichagulia: My Name is Baye! Me and #Kujichagulia go way back! It was always my favorite day of #Kwanzaa...as a child I was, er, encouraged to memorize the meanings of all the principles. But, even in first grade, at 6 years old, I was already a lover of words, particularly when they have cadence and resonance. So, I devoured words, no encouragement required. The words I committed to memory then still resonate with me today:  Kujichagulia - Self-determination: To define ourselves, name ourselves and speak for ourselves instead of being defined and spoken for by others. "Others" was not presented as a dubious term, either. It had a definite meaning. It meant people who would sooner see you perish than prevail, slumber than succeed. It meant people who would teach you that you are the descendants of uncivilized, uneducated, cannibalistic, spear-chucking jungle bunnies, and that slaving for "civilized" people was a significant step up from your original lifestyle. It meant people who would insist that your condition is part of a mysterious God's master plan (according to a book in which that master plan is supposedly written), that you and everyone who looks like you have been cursed by that God, sentenced to the suffering you endure, the conditions under which you live, until the end of days, for sins committed by some guy some time in the distant past. It also meant people who were subservient to or blinded by "the man", or went out of their way to be like, look like, dress like, think like and act like "the man". It meant "The Man". It was around that time that my school informed me that the name my father gave me (who was MIA by then) was unsuitable for a young African, that he'd been blinded by the man (through no fault of his own...the system was designed to blind) and wound up naming me in the dark. And that it was time I stepped into the light and chose my own name. Actually, my daddy wasn't blind...at least he hadn't been the last time I saw him. But I had a smart mouth and talking back to teachers at this school was, er, discouraged. The teacher placed before me (and all my classmates) a book of African names. "Choose one." "Me???" "Ye

Excerpt from my latest #BlackEye for @thejapantimes : "I’m hopeful that, as was the case in the U.S., as more black talents break into the entertainment industry here and prove themselves profitable to its gatekeepers, among them will emerge someone with the irrepressible, undeniable, game-changing excellence of, say, a Sidney Poitier. An agent of change, if you will, capable of compelling Japanese audiences to question everything they think they know about blackness."

It All Started With A Blog... Long before the lectures and the speaking engagements, the newspaper column and the books, the accolades and criticism, the admirers and the haters, there was only a blog called "Loco in Yokohama." 9 years ago today, I simply sat down and started writing. I had a few goals in mind and a general idea where my writing might lead, of course. Like most writers I had visions of seeing my name and ideas writ large in bookstore windows and movie screens, and all over this wonderful internet. And, yes, at the heart of LIY was a social agenda. One that would bring me closer to Japan and Japan closer to me. Into this digital vessel I poured all my hopes and aspirations, my fears and trepidations, my dreams and my nightmares, my life as I knew it. It's intimate, LIY is. And this relationship I established with readers, most of whom I only know through avatars and words, made it all worthwhile. It's real to me...as real as the virtual gets. I started a narrative, that autumn in Yokohama, one that continues til this day. A narrative that is as much a part of me as my limbs and organs. Rightness and wrongness of any idea I've ever held dear has never stopped me. I've just followed my heart and mind, and here I am! I've grown, matured, and my craft has grown and matured with me, so to me LIY is like one of those etchings families have in their homes on a panel in a doorway marking their child's growth. To those of you who have followed my work here from its inception, I thank you for your continued allegiance and support. I hope I've earned it. I've certainly striven to. To you guys who've only encountered my work of late, fortunately (and unfortunately in some cases TBH) there is an archive, the entire evolution of my ideas about not only Japan but so much more, online for all to see, perpetually. It ain't all pretty, and some of it is quite humbling...but it's all real. And I can live with that. I'm very proud of Loco in Yokohama. I don't know where I'd be without her (but likely it would be a place with rubber on the walls and a daily meds dispenser). 🤪 Happy Anniversary Loco in Yokohama! Love always, Baye McNeil www.locoinyokohama.com

I was chatting with a Japanese associate today, who'd read my latest series for #BlackEye and gave me one of those moments that stick. Let me paraphrase because I can't recall the exact words: "When I read your story about Sacko-san's life in China, I was very moved. Particularly when he explained how the Chinese viewed Africans (quote from article: 'Africans were living naked in the trees in Africa, so we weren't supposed to have anything.') At the time, I'm sure I thought the same as the Chinese do. And I'm not alone. But after reading about his life, his achievements against incredible odds, I understand not only how horribly wrong I was, but how widespread that thinking is, not only in China but here. After that I even read through some of the past articles and there's just so much to learn about black people. You're really doing something wonderful here, and more Japanese need to read these articles. We have to find a way to get these stories translated to Japanese! Let me look into it!" I sat there speechless for a sec, as it dawned on me that this was the FIRST time in the three years since I've started the column that a Japanese person (not a friend) has said these words to me, in this way. Of course I've gotten emails from all over, from people of many shades and nationalities, thanking me for what I do and encouraging me to keep it up. And yes I've had J-folk say "sugoi!" and "kakkoii!" and that kind of stuff quite a bit, but they always seemed to be more impressed with the fact I wrote for a newspaper, than with the work itself. Anyway, it was a moment. One that'll stick. Thought I'd share it with you guys. And thanks as always for your support! Your likes and shares, your thoughts and feedback, criticism, praise and encouragement, mean something. Mean everything. Not just to me, but to the powers that be at The Japan Times who are of course interested in how my work is received and dispersed.

Me: New York is a totally different environment from Yokohama. Totally. All I can say is you need to learn to be alert without being paranoid, to embrace the risk as part of the experience. If not, you’ll wind up hiding in some Japanese enclave in New Jersey and it’ll be like you never let Japan. Student: Enclave? Me: Picture Chinatown, with Japanese, and a kinokuniya. http://www.locoinyokohama.com/2017/09/27/autumn-in-new-york-advising-a-japanese-friend-about-nyc/

Teaching Biracial Bilingual kids has its challenges. As does teaching Japanese kids who return to Japan from living abroad. Here's an incident involving both that occurred a while back. http://www.locoinyokohama.com/2017/09/26/is-baye-sensei-a-nee-gah-too/

O Say Can You See the Hypocrisy? When NFL player Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the singing of the anthem, in a stand against inequality and injustice --PRE- Trump mind you -- he was labeled unpatriotic, and shoved into a now stigmatic box labeled BLM. If respect and love for America requires blindness to America’s failure to honor its promise of racial justice and equality then I'm hard put to call that Freedom. That's hypocrisy, gosh darn it! Now when huge numbers of black men in that same NFL are taking a knee, for the very same reason - in protest of inequality and injustice - it's being labeled a protest against Trump! And ironically is much more widely supported by the hypo-patriotic (hypocri-triotic? Hypatriotical? trying to find a good mash-up of hypocritical and patriotic) Inequality and injustice didn't start with Trump, and won't end with Trump, folks. We can do better! And let us not forget the anthem before was made radio-friendly: “No refuge could save the hireling and slave, From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave. And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave, o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.” It wasn't exactly written for black people to be singing (well, except for Whitney Houston...she owned that tune!

Umbrellas in Japan are not communal property...at least they're not supposed to be. But, sometimes, especially on rainy days, well, rules are made to be broken. http://www.locoinyokohama.com/2017/09/24/mi-kasa-su-kasa-aoi-sans-last-stand/

Chikan (perverts) on the trains here in Japan are a plague. I don't know how people can turn a blind eye to this. They've recently installed cameras on trains. Hmmm... I think I've got a better deterrent. http://www.locoinyokohama.com/2017/09/21/obstructing-japanese-chikan-perverts-on-the-trains/
