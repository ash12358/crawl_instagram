Humans do too much thinking, planning and processing. When I receive inspiration, I don’t like to think about it. I take inspired action because I trust myself 💁 my heart ❤️ and the Universe ✨. That is how I radically change my life and my circumstances so quickly. In fact, 90-days ago I was living a completely different life than I am today. All because I received inspiration and took action ❣️ Inspiration + action. It’s the only way 🙌 You’ve done enough 💭 It’s time to take a leap. http://www.briseeley.com/entrepreneur-the-big-leap (link in profile)

You deserve to live a life you're obsessed with. No two people want the same things for their life - so, why would you try to live a life someone else was obsessed with? 💯

In any given moment of any day you can choose to be a participant of life or a creator. · What's the difference? · Participants float through life getting by, but never fully creating what it is they desire. Things may seem easy, but they are never fulfilled. Participants like the idea of creating what's in their heart... But rarely do they take a stand for themselves, risk anything or get out of their comfort zones. · Creators on the other hand are fully immersed in life. They are willing to do anything and everything to make life what they want it. They don't wait around. They don't let the circumstances around them dictate their happiness or success. · So, on this Monday.... What are you choosing - to participate or create?

The two suicides this week have rocked me to my core and triggered such deeply buried feelings around my father’s suicide from 20-years ago. · Our world is hurting in so many ways. Existing in pain has become the norm. Denying what's happening in our heads and our hearts has become a way of life. Until it's too late. · How has our culture gotten to a place where more and more people believe the only possible solution to their problems is death? People who are so beloved by those around them - including their children. · My heart aches even more for the two daughters left behind this week. I know their pain, their confusion, their anger, their sadness. I know their lives will never be the same. My cheeks are stained with tears for them. My chest feels the blow of defeat for them. My mind echos with their questions.... Could I have done something? Was it my fault? · If you’re feeling like suicide is your only option, please remember - it’s not. As #RoseMcGowan said this morning, “Suicide is a permanent response to a temporary issue.” Help is out there. Help is available. You are so fucking loved. You are never alone. · If you need someone to talk to, please call 1-800-273-8255 · #suicideprevention #mentalhealthawareness #katespade #anthonybourdain #mentalhealth

Loved chatting it up with @kristilarson333 and @chrisbergvnl on #NorthDakotaToday yesterday morning!!!

Your intuition is the most powerful tool you have. It is the only thing which will ever lead you down the proper path. · And yet, most people haven't developed the connection to hear + listen long enough to receive the guidance they seek. · Why? · It takes time. This is one area where you can't "instant gratification" your way to the answer. There is no Google search to answer the questions you have or provide the clarity you seek. · It's a practice. One that I have personally been consciously developing for over a decade. And one which you have an opportunity to develop for yourself as well. · Make it a priority. Carve out time. Show up. Connect. Have patience. Every single day. · It will change your life.... Way more than any expert formula, recipe for success ever could. · #motivationalquote #motivationalmonday #inspirationalquote #intuition #yourintuitionledyouhere #changeyourlife #changeyourmindset #developyourself #creativeentrepreneur #entrepreneurial #womeninbiz #womenentrepreneurs #womenempoweringwomen #superpowers #successfulwomen #successquote #bringyourdreamstolife #dreamitdoit #houseofintuition

What do you say to describe the best mom ever? How do you express gratitude to the woman who is not only responsible for your existence, but also your survival? · This is always one of the hardest posts for me to write each year.... because I never have the words to adequately express how powerful, selfless, magical and supportive this woman is. · Spending today with her is sweet in so many ways because we not only get to celebrate her on this day, we get to celebrate that 35 years ago she spent her early morning hours bringing me into the world. · Mama Seeley - I love you. You're the best of the best of the best. I am so grateful to have you on my journey with me... Thank you for all you've done and all you continue to do as a mom. · Thank you for keeping me safe + making sure I survived so many traumatic experiences. Thank you for kicking my ass out of the house to return to Italy. Thank you for all the years of sewing help. Thank you for helping to empower my voice at such a young age. Thank you for bringing me along for a variety of adventures + travels. Thank you for introducing me to a variety of people and experiences to expand my horizons. Thank you for showing me the magic of breakfast for dinner. Thank you for encouraging such transparent communication (and putting me in therapy at the age of 3!) in our home. Thank you for introducing me to healthy eating at such a young age. And thank you for all the little things in between - the mundane evenings of cuddling on the couch, sitting on the porch to watch the rain, opening our home to friends, etc. · And more than anything - giving me the work ethic, the compassion, the tenacity and the creativity to do what I do and be who I am in the world. · #happymothersday #mothersdaygift #entrepreneurial #gratitudejournal #gratefulheart #momsweekend #mamacita #gratefulforlife #birthdayvibes #birthdayqueen #birthdaylove #momanddaughter #mothersday2018 #may13 #minneapolis #minneapolismn #mnnice #mpls #familypictures

I receive a lot of messages from people that say, "You inspire me!" And it pisses me off. · I'm always kind in my response but in my head I'm screaming at them. · Why? Because being inspired doesn't mean shit. · I see inspiration as the spiritual side of a 2-sided coin. The other side is the human, earthly aspect of life. Where we take that inspiration, creativity, guidance and we transform it into a tangible reality. · Our world has become this massive content machine. We consume more and more and more. We learn. We read books. We read articles. We podcast. We attend workshops and seminars and events. · And yet, the percentage of people who apply the knowledge, take action and create from that received inspiration is the minority. (Side note: which is why I teach in the manner I teach. I don't speak to inspire - I make people do the inner work while I'm in the room with them. I don't simply distill information to my clients - we make a plan about how to implement. I do my best to end every podcast with a call to action to the listeners to apply the knowledge to their lives immediately. I filled my book with practical tools and exercises, instead of just more information.) · I'm in this great phase of life now where I'm NOT learning more. Rarely do I consume information and, when I do, it's usually a simple reminder of what I already know. · Instead, I'm not only consuming less... But I'm also UN-learning most of what I've been taught, told and retained in my life. · Because my next growth spurt isn't going to come from some external knowledge... It's going to come from remembering my greatness, reconnecting to my innate power and surrendering to what's already existing within me. · Yesterday, I hired a coach. The third coach I've hired in the last 8-years. Because consuming more information and being inspired will not get me to the place I dream of. My next evolution will not come from a book, or a catchy quote, or social media, or an interview, or an article. Those things are a great place to start, AND..... · Continued in comments below.

One of the best things about what I do is getting to SEE the transformation in my clients. Yes, there are emotional and energetic shifts... But there are also physical shifts. Because when you truly embody your soul essence, it shows. · Meet @grievenow - she has transformed from who she thought she "should" be, to the woman her soul CRAVED her to be. · I've watched her shed story after story, belief after belief, limitation after limitation. She is literally a completely different woman than I met a year ago. · Simply because she decided to become that woman. And now she's not only living HER best life, but she's now supporting others to heal so they can do the same. It's been such an honor to witness Laura's transformation onto her soul path. · Transformation isn't easy. There are a million reasons to stay where you are and.... At least one major reason not to: You deserve to live the life and become the woman your soul is craving for. Period. · You fucking deserve all the happiness and fulfillment and enjoyment life has to offer. And you don't need to wait another day to experience it. Do your future self a favor and begin now. · #mindsetiseverything #mindsetcoach  #successfulwomen #entrepreneurial #changeyourlife #changeyourmindset #transformationthursday #beyourbest #beyourownboss #entrepreneurmindset #womeninbiz #womenentrepreneurs #womensempowerment #youareabadass #theuniversehasyourback #newyorklife #thursdaymotivation #thursdaythoughts #lifecoaching #womenempoweringwomen

Five years ago I couldn’t even IMAGINE being on television. Of course, I wanted to.... but I didn’t think it was possible for me. • Then @todayshow called and asked me to do a segment. Who me? I couldn’t possibly have something important to say. • Not only was I a bundle of nerves, but I was convinced they’d take my words out of context and make me look crazy. (side note: they didn’t and it was an amazing segment) • And then I didn’t attract another television appearance for two years. • Why? Was it because I wasn’t capable of being on TV? Or because I wasn’t a good fit? No. It was because I didn’t believe I was the kind of person who was on TV regularly. • #DrWayneDyer said, “The Universe doesn’t give you what you want, it gives you who you are.” • Once I did the inner work to become the kind of woman, leader + business owner who knew her worth, value and contribution... Well, let’s just say, we’re only 4 months into the year and I have landed three television appearances (so far!!!). • If there’s something in your life that you desire.... you need to first BECOME the person who has that in your life. • What does that mean? Well, if you want to be a millionaire, you first have to become a millionaire internally before you see the money in the bank. If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, you first have to become that on the inside before your business blows up on the outside. • Do the work. Turn inwards. Make the changes. Heal your doubts. Transform who you are and you’ll transform the results you see in the world around you. • And if you can’t do it alone - send me a message right now. This is what I do. I help people become their future selves internally, so they can live the lives they desire. • Let’s get working so the Universe can send you more of what you want because it’s simply aligned with who you are. • #huffingtonpost #newdaynewme #transformationthursday #tvpersonality #authorlife #seattlelife #lifecoaching #theuniversehasyourback #changeyourlife #successfulwomen #createyourlife #manifestation #manifest

As I prepare to embark on my new adventure (this time next week), I think back to my little self - the little girl who had idolized New York since she know what it was.... The little girl who was shy and withdrew from being seen.... The little girl who had always known there was more out there, but didn't believe it was possible for her.... And I just can't help but wonder how she'd react to the adult version of her. · What would she say if I told her she would have an international brand... That she got to support people in building their dream life... That she would be standing on stages in front of hundreds... That she had lived and traveled around the world... That her heart was happy and full... · I just wonder what her face would look like with this knowing... And if she could have lived a little lighter, a little brighter... And if she could have enjoyed more peace knowing the pains she was experiencing were happening for her, instead of to her... · I've taking so much space (30 hours and counting!) this week to heal, process and grieve. And I will continue to do so because this next leg of my journey requires my heart to be clear, my intuition to be open and my mind to be focused. · This weekend, give yourself permission to celebrate how far you've come... And how far you have yet to travel... And let your little child self be in awe of who you are in the world. They deserve to witness your evolution. · And, remember - it's just the beginning, my love... Just the beginning. · #transformations #healingenergy #herosjourney #josephcampbell #lifecoaching #journeyoflife #successfulwomen #womeninbiz #womenentrepreneurs #lifeisbeautiful #liveyourdreams

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.  #helenkeller · One year ago my friendship with this women blossomed into an infinitely deeper, collaborative and more supportive relationship than I've ever known. It's raised the bar for the kind of relationships I allow in my life - because anything less than pure support and collaboration isn't worth my time, energy or heart. · As women, this is how we're built to function best. Not the competition shit we're fed... But true rising together. · And that doesn't mean it's all "Rah rah" cheerleading. It means being in the depths, seeing each other in pain and kicking each other in the ass when it's needed. · Women, it's time to change the way we connect, support and relate. It's time for us to rise together. · Who is your Badass soul sister? Tag her in the comments and let her know how much you appreciate your friendship.

Over the last 3 weeks, I have experienced the roughest, lowest and most challenging time of my entrepreneurial career. I have faced demon’s. I have downsized. I have been closer to quitting than ever before. I have even applied to 9-5 jobs, which you may know is about equal to death for me. This is the closest I’ve ever come to throwing in the towel and hiding in a self-imposed hole (aka. packing the kitties into Lex and moving back to Northfield to live w my parents). · I’ve had doubts over the last several years, but nothing like this. I have vacillated between extreme peaceful acceptance and crushing, paralyzing confusion. Most days I feel bipolar. I feel completely nuts. My mood can change in an instant from the highest highs to the lowest lows. It’s literally like nothing I’ve ever faced in my *almost* 35 years on the planet. · DISCLAIMER: I am not sharing this to be fixed. I don’t need help or recommendations. Why? Because I’m not broken. I am completely whole. A week ago I called this experience an existential crisis…. but I stopped myself and changed my languaging. Because I fully understand and recognize this is an existential AWAKENING. It is simply a rebirth. I am being shattered down and shattered open. Things are being removed and rearranged. · Did you know caterpillars fully disintegrate before emerging as butterflies? They break down into a messy goo of nothingness in order to be reconstructed into beauty. I am currently goo. · One thing that has been constant over the last three weeks is my community. Holy fucking hell. My friends are legitimately the best. Hands down. I have been shown such unbelievable support and unconditional love. So many of them have witnessed me crying and in pain. The most beautiful part is…. not one of them has tried to fix me. Yesterday a dear friend, whom I’ve never even met in person before, simply said, “I’m sorry. I see you.” It was literally the most healing thing anyone has ever done for me. · A few days prior, a girlfriend reminded me that when it feels as if the Universe is pulling you back 10 steps, there is no choice but to slingshot you forward from here. · Continued in the comments.

Have you pre-ordered your copy of #PermissionToLeap yet? One of my early readers had this to say about the book: "Permission to Leap is a visceral journey through the 'leaping' process. I've written best-selling books about taking risks and rejecting the status quo, but Bri has formalized the concept of leveling-up your life by developing an executable system around it. Her writing is raw and unapologetic, yet profound and refreshing. You'll finish this book with renewed strength, along with an actionable plan. You'll be marching toward your best future self with your head held high, knowing nothing can stop you." - Jesse · Secure your signed copy today at briseeley.com/preorder (link in profile) #taketheleap #lifecoaching #leapoffaith #createyourlife #authorlife

Just got off a call with a woman who is so frustrated. · Her: "I don't know what else to do to make this manifest in my life!" · Me: "What if you don't need to DO anything? What if now just isn't the right time?" · Remember... The universe doesn't make mistakes. Be patient my love. #taketheleap #createyourlife #leapoffaith

"....And in the end she became more than she expected." @rmdrk · My last day in Seattle and my heart is all sorts of raw feeling the bittersweet of leaving one home for another's · The journey I've experienced here has been remarkable in so many ways. I'm walking away not only as an Author, but I feel like an entirely new woman. My heart has been cracked wide open, my vision is more real than ever, and I'm ready to embark on the next big expansion to serve the world. · Photo by the incomparable @lizvone last night at @cloudroomseattle #authorlife #seattlelife #transformed

Reasons Monday is the best day of the week.... 1. They're a fresh start. 2. Statistically they are the least rainy day of the week. 3. It's the best day to buy a car. 4. There is an entire week in front of you. 5. They're the most productive day of the week. 6. It's the best traffic day of the week.

Being a human is hard. It's messy. It's beautiful. It's frustrating. It's exhilarating. It's overwhelming. It's liberating. · Show up. Always. No matter the circumstances. Do it anyway. Get messy. Be joyful. · If we're not enjoying the totality of the human experience, then what the fuck are we here for anyway? #fact

Getting a little relaxation in before my acupuncture appointment. I haven't gone to acupuncture in over ten years due to a needle phobia. What changed? Well, not my phobia... As evidenced by the anxiety in my heart and the sweat on my palms. What changed is my dedication to my health. I'm willing to get so uncomfortable and confront my deepest fears in pursuit of health. Because that's sometimes what it takes.... And I'm unwilling to suffer physically any longer just because my mind has categorized a certain experience as terrifying. #letsdothis #justbreathe

Lately.... Every time I think I have life all figured out, I'm shown exactly how much I don't know. Tonight's yoga practice was a great example of that.... Again and again I was faced with how little I have figured out. I may be a teacher and mentor to many, but I will always be a student - always committed to learning new information, knowing more, and continually growing. #aerialyoga #namaste

In my happy place this week... My zone of genius... Leading over 2100 people thru mindset training... And it's nothing short of magic. · Sitting in so much awe... Knowing where I was a year ago... So lost and unsure what I needed to use my voice for... You see, I've known that teaching and inspiring was my path... But not the specifics... Until I opened up my vision of possibility... Which, oddly enough, is what I now teach... · What IS possible? Such a great question. Because we usually focus on the impossibility. But unfortunately that only continues to create more impossibilities. So I ask you... What's possible for you TODAY? Look at the world from that perspective... see what shifts... And then tell me all about it below 😉 #lawofattraction #manifestation

Rainy day vibes.... I'm all running around my house in full 80's getup after literally feeling like this walking home... Rocking my off the shoulder sweater, leggings, leg warmers, and curly hair. Now all I need is the #flashdance moves 😉 Who wants to teach me? #larain #flashflood

It is not time to be silent. Each of us has a voice to stand up for equality and justice. How are you using yours? Are you using it to argue with people who don't agree with you - thus alienating and spreading more division? Or are you using it to inspire and spread messages of love and unity? Pause. Reflect. Reevaluate. Inspire. Our future generations will thank you for it later. Assuming we make it that far.... #lovetrumpshate #aspiretoinspire

The beginning of 2017 has been really tough. High stress levels... Loads of tears... Convinced my baby was going to die... But an epiphany that I had a few weeks ago has helped me get through it with a smile on my face, and joy in my heart. Want to know what it was?

Sunday night food for thought.... Feeling a little feisty after seeing an article from @ellevate_ntwk on @forbes this evening. I used to love the #girlboss movement. And I do think it was good for a period of time - there are so many more female entrepreneurs in the world who took the leap because of this book. But it's gotten stale to me and feels more demeaning than empowering. Do you call your male entrepreneur friends #boyboss? Probably not. Because they're bosses. So, why are we different? (Response: we're not). Thoughts? #bosslife #entrepreneurlife #justaboss

We did it in 1913. We did it in the 1970's. And today we do it again. Unity. Peace. Equality. Our voices will be heard. Our rights will be honored. Our bodies. Our lives. #womensmarch #feminist #humanist #lovetrumpshate

It's a momentous week in our world history. It's a time when we need more women in their power. And I'll be damned if I'm going to sit on the sidelines and wait for it. So here's a little #bts action of me filming my new digital course today. I'm ready to support and catalyze the masses in creating ridiculous change - the kind of change that will positively impact the world.... Not the kind of change that is all talk or the kind of change that is only good for 1% of our population. #justsayin #behindthescenes

Your simple beingness is so incredibly important - especially now. Osho said, "Activity is an escape from yourself - it is a drug. In activity you forget yourself, and when you forget yourself there are no worries, no anxiety, no anguish. That's why you need to be continuously active, doing something or other." Please, for the love of all things you - make space for NON- activity. It will change everything in your life. I promise. #lightworker #miraclemorning #newyearsday

After an epic year of phenomenal manifestations.... Coupled with extreme numbness.... I'm taking on a new kind of intention for 2017 - passion. I'm ready to dive fully into life instead of living it on the surface. What's your intention for 2017? #entrepreneurlife #baliliving #newyearseve2016

I didn't realize how emotional I'd get leaving Bali. For a place that I've only "known" for two weeks, this place stole my heart. The people, the culture, the scenery, the food, the lifestyle.... I'm returning to the states a different woman. Excited to bring the Bali magic back with me to continue my journey ✨💗✨#baliliving

The word 'Ubud' literally means medicine. Which I don't doubt. It is hands down the most healing, serene, and inspirational places I've ever traveled. What is the most transformational trip you've ever taken? #baliliving #wanderlust #UbudBali

What's the most beautiful, magical iteration of your life and this world that you can possibly imagine? Go there. Immerse yourself in what it would feel like to be there. Operate from that feeling. #entrepreneurlife

When is the last time you took a moment to really just observe? Observe life.... Observe yourself.... Observe your thoughts.... All in complete reflection without letting judgment or frustration get in the way? Give yourself the gift of observation + reflection this time of year. It will change everything. I promise.

Today is an important day in our history. And while I don't agree with the structure of our political system (we can ALL agree it's broken, right?) I also don't agree with hatred, racism, bigotry, and violence. So I took to the polls on Sunday and stood in line for THREE hours to make sure that our country is put into the hands of someone who will have our best interest at heart. I don't care what you're doing today - go vote. Find the time. It's important. #imwithher · Disclaimer: any hateful comments will be deleted.

I freaking love what I do... Someone asked me this week what I do in terms of personal projects for myself because I'm always creating projects to be shared with the world. And my response was pretty much.... I don't. Even my personal projects end up being shared with others to support their journey. So, it's only natural that I'm relaunching my SUPER popular 7-day Manifestation Training to share all my secrets about how to create more of what you WANT in your life. The 1000 women who participated last time created epic results in just one week. I'm so excited to see what gets created this time. Plus, it's free - so what do you have to lose?

Wow. Two years has passed since I published this article on @huffpostwomen... Still to this day, it's one of the most terrifying submissions I've ever made. Immediately after hitting publish, every ounce of my body wanted to take it back. I wanted to run and hide and just delete it all from the world. But I didn't {let's be real, it's mostly because I couldn't take it back}. And because of it, I was able to experience my voice in a whole new way - PLUS it started a ripple of other women standing in their voices. I'll never forget the email I received from a woman who was in her 50's. She had a similar surgery done 20 years prior and had never told a soul. Until she read my article and she felt safe to honor and share her truth. There is no more powerful feeling than knowing you inspiring that in another person. So, next time you are thinking of staying quiet because no one cares or because what you have to say isn't important or because you're scared of the aftermath..... please remember that there is someone out there who needs to hear your story. Someone is out there who needs to experience your truth, simply for them to have permission to own their truth.

Remember that one time I manifested myself a segment on the #todayshow? Want to know how I did it? I'm teaching a FREE 7-day Manifestation Challenge starting next week where I'll drop ALL my master secrets and knowledge on creating epic sh*t. I'm so excited! Can't wait to see what the participants create in the time we're together.... It will be nothing short of magical - I'm sure of it.

It's crazy what you can manifest + create in your life when you believe in the possibility.
