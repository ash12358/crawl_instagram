Ah, but which Murakami does one begin with? Not in pic: 1Q84.

July TBR: The Mistborn Trilogy After binge-reading Berserk to its latest chapter and since Game of Thrones recently ended, I hope this trilogy could fill that fantasy gap and live up to its hype! Also hoping to read as much as possible in July before I start working next month. ðŸ“š #adultingsucks

Just some classics that I've been meaning to read lately. ðŸ“š

Words cannot express how deeply this book hurt and affected me. That night, upon finishing it, I cried as I fell asleep. And it is in that moment that I realised how I need to treat myself & others better, to offer & accept help, to be grateful for my life and the people in it, and to try being a better person altogether. Jude's life and story will stay with me, if not forever, but for a very, very long time. Thank you, @hanyayanagihara, for this harrowing journey.

2016 Reading Resolution: Reading more literary fiction. I have these wonderful books lined up for 2016 and I can't wait to dive into A Little Life and The Secret History. Heard so many great things about these two so I'm really excited. Also looking forward to reading more fantasy. Hopefully I'd be able to make the best out of the new year. ðŸ“š

As 2015 comes to a close, just a tiny reflection on my reading journey this year. Out of the 74 books I've read in 2015, The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt still stands out as my absolute favourite. Absorbing, haunting, and brilliant. Other notable mentions ðŸ“š: Revival by Stephen King, 1984 by George Orwell and The Chaos Walking trilogy by Patrick Ness. Overall, 2015 was a really good reading year for me and here's to hoping for a bigger and greater 2016. âœ¨

Early Christmas gift for myself. Can't wait to read these babies. ðŸŒ³
