A couple of weeks ago I decided that I should take a break from posting on IG. My intention was to go a whole month without posting but then my favorite season at Starbucks kicked off!

I first met Eddie and Ana when we had, for a second, gotten dismissed from dancing with the LSU Fiesta‚Äôs dance group. Ever since that moment I thought they were the coolest couple I had ever met and I really wanted to be friends with them. Well, some time after that Eddie and I served on LSU council and I became Theta Nu Boo while Ana was an undergrad sister. They took care of me when they didn‚Äôt need to and were always there for me. They were (as I refer to them) my college parents. Fast forward to this weekend and I got to experience/ be a part of them coming together in marriage. I truly am so happy for both of you and wish you the best! Thank you for letting me be a part of your special day.
