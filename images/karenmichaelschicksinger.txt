Omg it’s barely 8am and I’ve already been 😭 like a 😜!! Who inspires YOU when you are tired and feel down and out and the odds are stacked against you? 😍 These ladies get my engines REVVED! 💥 My post was so long that I’m going to put the rest of it in the comments. I simply couldn’t edit out anything I said about these amazing ladies. 💋🎵🌟 I’ll start with my BFF... My BFF, my daily chat, my Mommy advisor, my costume designer (she seriously dresses Disney Stars, is an UBER talent and runs a theater and event company with her husband AND is a Mommy, OMG) is my superstar friend, Jen. I don’t know what I’d do without her…I love her dearly and my day is not complete without a call or text from her. We have both lost our Moms and somehow we have managed to fill some of that void with our ever-deepening friendshipto you, Jen…🥂❤️ @stargazerproductionsandevents @cstheaterfontana

Happy June 1st!! Just a little peek into my mornings... you can find me here 🎹 most mornings practicing, working on my technique, prepping for my students, and rehearsing. I’ve got 2 gigs next week, one with my curvy girls, vocal jazz trio and one with a Big Band! And it’s, of course, completely different songs and styles! 🤓 🎵 Music fills my ❤️ in ways I cannot explain. I am happiest with my boys around me, my fur babies at my feet (you can’t see them, but they’re under the piano) and songs flowing! 😍 🎵 Enjoying the journey of practicing and rehearsing is huge for me. I share with my students to practice with focus and intention. 15 minutes of gorgeously focused practice is WAY more productive then 2 hours of just pounding the keys or getting through your songs. I’ll be sharing more of my practice strategies this month. 🎵✅🎤 What are your favorite practice strategies? 🤔

How much do I LOVE having these moments with my Little Man?! We are going to do ✍️ tutorials twice a week and see how much we can improve our drawing skills. 🦋 • I got up super early to do my 💻 work and practice 🎹 and 🎵 for my upcoming gigs.

I’ll be sure to share what I’m learning with you. I 💗 sharing with you all! It makes me so 😃! It’s gonna be incredible! One is for biz and one is for 🎶. • That’s what Summer is for, right?!

So last night’s Facebook Live on my voice teaching page went a little janky... 🤷‍♀️ 😜 it looked great as I was filming and then ended up on its side! OMG!! 🤦‍♀️🚫 Thanks to my BFF 👯‍♂️ for texting me and saying I was having a great hair day, had an awesome message and PS did you know your video is sideways?! 😮 Did I cry and scream and freak out?! Did I throw my beloved 📱 across the room? Nope. I finished teaching 🎹 and 🎤 and then I calmly got on my 💻 downloaded and reposted. AND had 3 messages to book lessons. AND 1 message to sing a recording session. 😃 🤔 Why do YOU think this happened with a janky video?! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ I’ll tell you why!! I am an AVID podcast listener and course taker. I’ve taken video courses, writing courses, piano courses, singing courses (I’ve got a straw thing going on that is life-changing!! Thanks @lizjohnsonvoice 💋). Constantly learning and growing and surrounding yourself with awesome people (thanks to @faithculturekiss for an amazing group! 🌟 ) is the ticket, friends. And don’t tell me it’s too 💰, ‘cuz podcasts are FREE!! The one I listened to today is INCREDIBLE! Go download @chalenejohnson Podcast and binge listen. DO IT!! Oh yeah...Happy Friday. See you next week. I’m working on recording some songs for you because you’ve been asking and I’m nervous to do that so I guess that means I have to. ❤️🎶💋

Hey there! If you have been wanting to up your vocal and/or piano game... now’s the time!! I’m going to start posting anytime I have a last minute opening. Voice lessons, piano lessons, audition prep and performance techniques. Most of my slots are full, but when you can sneak in for a session, why not?! I’ve got lots to share...years of touring, live performance and teaching behind me.  I am humbled to admit I rarely have openings but I have many of you on my wait list! Don’t wait!! Jump in!! I am going to be much better about posting last minute openings in my studio for voice and piano lessons.  I am really busy, but I want to fit you all in!! Like my page at Vocal Power Las Vegas for up to date info on availability and masterclasses. 🎶🦋🎹

Tonight’s office, my piano selfie and a silly pic from a quick video I did for my biz group today! I can’t believe this is my job!!! This home is positively stunning, everyone is so nice and I’m singing all my fave songs!! Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Ella, Elton, Billy Joel, Joni Mitchell and so many more!! You know you guys can do whatever you dream of, right?? My Mom and Dad always told me that and yet I still somehow lost track and needed to be reminded. Get yourself a  coach, a mentor, a teacher and surround yourself with a strong and loving support system. For me, it was God reminding me, too. Those are the smartest decisions you can make! I ❤️ you!!

Welcome, October 1st!! One of my fave days of the year. It’s the perfect time to evaluate things and tighten up plans to finish up the year in a fabulously #bosschick #tigermom #spiritchick kind of way. I’m working on my biz(s) and how to uplevel things there. I’ve joined groups and taking classes. I’m buying an upright (yup, I’m actively looking now!) for Chicksinger Studios and reconfiguring things for more room and more efficient rehearsing and teaching. I’m getting new pics done in January and shopping for photogs. So that means working on my health and meditation and prayer. To better serving my students and my artistry. The energy in the air is cool and vibrant and loving. The better I do, the more I support my family and can give to the world. Yes, I said World! 🌎😍 Tell me your plans to finish out the year!! Let’s keep each other accountable!

Fall is here with the Autumn Equinox happening now!! 🍁 I find myself revisiting the same rituals in the Fall...I wanna finish up the year big!  This weekend is full of family time 👪 and bullet journal creation ✏️ 📓 for my piano practice 🎹 and for my music studio 🎶 and, of course, practice. I also start listening to 🎄🎅🏻 music ‘cuz it’s just too pretty for only 1 month of listening!! What are your Fall rituals? 🦋💋

It's off to a curvy girl jazz trio rehearsal and then teaching all afternoon my beloved piano and voice. Just had to share this time hop photo... my sweetheart chow Mikko loves to hang by the band when there's a rehearsal no matter how loud it is!! ❤️🦋🎶🐶

Happy Friday sweet friends! It's been a WEEK at the Michaels household. What gets me through EVERY dang time is taking 5 minutes to thank God and The Universe for all that I have. Gratitude goes a long way to lifting the spirit. The other is of course, 🎶 🎹🎼🎤🎵! Just the action of putting hands on the piano and singing brings me enormous amounts of joy! Find your music and you will be forever happy! Have a beautiful weekend! I@ hoping to go live at the jazz in the park tomorrow so check back! Praying for good outdoor reception! ☺️🦄🙏🏻

Good morning, sweet Friends! I’ve been using Instagram for a while, but it’s time to make a friendly introduction, I haven’t done that in so long! 🎉🌞 Most describe me as a happy, peppy, hardworking, always studying, coming up with new ways of singing old songs, kind of chicksinger and pianist! 🎶🎹 My friends agree, and they might also say I can be über passionate and wildly consumed with my music and my students, and, my family!!! My son is my ❤️ and my husband and I are filled with gratitude and joy that he is in our lives. I’m passionate about growing as a pianist and truly upleveling my performance as a singer and pianist. I am currently writing a show 🎭🎶 as a solo artist and revamping the fabulous "Women in Music" show with my all girl vocal trio, Dangerous Curves. I love nothing more than sharing my music and getting people in touch with their most precious memories and with each other. Music has a way of transcending…of bringing together people in ways the spoken word does not…it fills my soul with such joy and sharing does that tenfold…🦋🌈🦄 Most weekends you’ll find me performing, (jazz in the park this weekend!) or crafting and drawing with our Little Man and on special days I might indulge in wine tasting and catching up on our fave shows (#GOT Season 7 got us good!) and all three of us love American Ninja Warrior! I so look forward to getting to know you more, so please leave a comment and share with me all about YOU! 💋

What's on your Things list today? Lots on this 🎶chicksinger🎶plate today from rehearsal to teaching and writing. However, the first thing on my list today was to donate to the Red Cross. Did you know you can do it straight from your iTunes account and 💯 % goes to help those in need from #hurricaneharvey2017. Let's help out our Texas friends in need. ❤️

Breakthrough!!! As many of you know I adore and worship my teacher. He's...in a word...UTTERLY AMAZING. Ok, that's two words. 😉 That being said, today he said "you sound good" WHILE I was accompanying someone...my husband!! Den's performing is off the charts and he does not follow the rules! Only the rules of his heart. He is a true and connected performer, and very hard to follow... until today!! 🙌🏻🏆🎉🎊 ok, ok back to practicing. Just had to share the victory! 🎶🎹🎵

So our little household is struggling with coughs and bronchitis and lack of sleep. I've been listening and listening and trying lots of different things from friends and from experts. I just made this juice from 🥕 , an 🍊 , an 🍎, a 🍋, 2 branches of ginger and filtered water. It's already making me feel better. Literally. I have the 2nd half waiting for Den when he gets home and then I'm gonna do a whole batch when my Little Man gets back from Gramma's. Years ago, I was a vegetarian for 5 solid years. Now I'm not saying I'm going to do that again...however I can't deny how I feel. I'm way to busy and have way too many songs to sing and way too many Mommy tasks to do to be any kind of sick. What steps are you taking for better health and wellness? Share with me!

Biz friends! Check out this amazing class from the sparkly, butt-kicking, loving biz coach, @coachglitter!! She is releasing a new class and I recommend you jump on board now!! It is selling like hotcakes and if she sells out before you have the chance to check it out that would totally suck! 🙃😋 I have learned and grown so much and my numbers are proof positive it works. 20% gain in likes, 100s more views per week. That's the real deal chick-a-dees. And listen, I'm not getting paid for this, I just love her and what she does. Ok enough! Now go before it says "sorry, you have been entered into the waitlist!" Yikes! 😘🥇🎯📈💯

I've been learning how to draw! ✏️ I read that when you incorporate other art forms into your life, it can improve your main artistry. I've found it can also be meditative for me. I'm trying to learn how to meditate and it's so hard for me to sit still and be quiet! 😂 However I've found when I'm sketching  and shading and going through the tutorial, my mind quiets the constant commentary. ❣️☮️🎶

Singing through my upcoming holiday work...🎶🎄🎅🏻 while I'm refreshing and decorating! I make a refresh spray with my fave @doterra oils Holiday Joy and Frankincense and Purify. 25 drops each (for the 25 days of 🎄) with filtered water. Makes my decor and home smell cozy and warm and helps to clean it up! 🎄🦃🎅🏻🎆

One of my upcoming intentions (instead of resolutions!) for 2017 is to increase my overall "art-fullness". I've never been able to draw or so I thought! I love horses so much! 🐴 Thank you, @markcrilleyreal, I'm so excited!! For a girl who usually draws stick people 😂 I feel happy! My son is my inspiration as he is a fabulous artist! My audience of fuzzy faces helped me to stay positive. ❤️🎶🐕

Pedicures and podcasts... I'm DIY-ing my pedi while listening to this amazing podcast. Lots of talk about self-marketing, vision boards and meditation. I SO want to get a meditation practice going.

Happy Friday! 🎉😊 As I was making my to do list, I started thinking that maybe I need to re-prioritize things. Go back to my vision board and make a to do list based on THAT! 🎯 Hmmm...

Thursday #inspiration! I wish I could say I thought of this piece of brilliance! Run on over to @coachglitter and her Facebook page and you will see and hear all kinds of fab inspiration! Not only that, I also listened to @chalenejohnson 's podcast about sharing your story. (Aug 4th edition) I'm telling you right now... If you actually want to move your biz forward you've got to follow these kinds of people!! I'm not an affiliate or anything like that. I just want you to be amazing. Find a teacher, find a mentor and they will hold you accountable and teach you how to move forward!! Let's go!

Round 1 of #whole30 in the can! Had an incredible experience doing this with a few of my nearest and dearest. Lost a few pounds, gained a lot of perspective. Taking a few days off, and then back on I go. Learning how much sugar is added into almost everything is astounding and quite frankly, disturbing. I'm so glad for the awareness this program has brought me. I'm ready for the next part of my journey!! 🌞💪🏻🏃🏼

Had a fantastic Dangerous Curves kind of morning! We were looking for some inspiration and boy did we find it in the oh-so-talented Betsy Holm! Nothing better than listening to a friend create beautiful music with a heart of gold to match. 🌞🎤🌟💋 @lovinjazzinvegas @gretmenz

Humbled and filled with gratitude for this lovely review from #clientsturnedfriends. How I ❤️ to share my 🎹🎤 with you! All of you! I'm working up the courage to make videos for you... I don't know why I'm so nervous about that, but I am!! My #mentor says what I fear, I must do. 😳 sigh... @brenebrown says "Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen". 👏🏻👏🏻 well then...let the seeing and hearing begin. 🎤🎹💋

Tonight's #viewfromthepiano this room at Red Rock faces the mountains and is absolutely stunning.

Yesterday's #viewfromthepiano  so stunning! I played Jann Arden's Saved as the processional/recessional. That round room! So beautiful! But I must say the people that live there... Truest, most beautiful souls. Not a dry eye, including mine, during the ceremony. ❤️ lives there.

Best sister/assistant/musichelper ever! 👭❤️ Today my sister helped me get my Mommy chores done and then helped me chart out 2 songs I'm playing this weekend that had no music! 🎶🎹 So blessed and grateful for her help. 🙏🏻 I got up at 330am today 😴 and still never would have got as far as I did without her help. ❤️🌟 This afternoon I've got a full studio of students. 🎤🎶🌟 Feeling pretty dang good right now! 💪🏻

Please meet Lila, my new bicycle! This was my Mother's Day gift from the hubs and I'm so excited! A sweet #schwinn ride of lilac and purple! 💜 With matching lilac #safetyhelmet, of course.

Working on my latest #blog post and it's making me crazy! I am a constant editor. Instead of letting the words flow and then going back to edit, I continually analyze the grammar AND the readability. 🙄 So, I'm going to think of it like singing a song in a live performance. I can't stop in that situation and say, wait, I didn't like that note, I need to sing it again! Can you imagine??? 😆LOL! What do you think? Good idea? Please opine! 💋

Good beautiful morning! Working on my list for the year and making set lists for my CES gig 🎹🎤 this week. I decided to make my own calendar/planner/passion guide as better budgeting is high on my list and all those gorgeous, fancy planners are 💵. Got myself some cute colored pencils and joined the @mikedooleytut #InfinitePossibilitiesProject and got my list going. Going to ⛪️ more is very high in my list and since I couldn't make it in person, I'm enjoying @centralhenderson online and I had to share His message! You ARE God's beloved! 🙏🏻Happy Sunday, friends! Whatever your goals, beliefs, dreams are, do it with light and love in your ❤️!

Word for 2016 #authentic!! I will be authentic and true to my inner being! My theme is #imstrongerthanithink!

Watching Cinderella as I'm cooking for our first dinner party of the season (from scratch Butternut Squash soup!) and this line just hit me! Gotta be authentic and true! I'm still working out my goals for 2016 (post coming soon) and somehow I think being TRULY authentic as an artist has just officially made my list... What are your goals? Let me know! Inspire me!! #chicksinger #pianochick #girlboss #blogger #mompreneur #momperformer

Starting working on my holiday wreaths and noticed they were musty from storage. I made a little freshener with DoTerra's Holiday Joy, a little water, a little oil and poof! They smell amazing and put a little shine on it, too! Off to my #pianolesson and #voicelesson (of course I still study!) have a #happytuesday! #vegaslife #doterraoils #pianochick #chicksinger #voiceteacher #pianoteacher

No baby, I can put my feet somewhere else...😂😜 my sweet #chowchow gets up early with me all the time but clearly it's tough. Her eyes looking down to see if I'll let her stay is killing me!!! 👀🐶 Anyone who gets up at 4am to hang out with me and keep my feet warm, while I get some writing done, has a special place in my ❤️! #dogsofinstagram #Mikkothechow  #onegirlband #pianist #chicksinger #vegaslife

A friend sent this to me...A very hard lesson to learn. One I hope to refine and figure out...do you think being nice is holding you back?

I am OBSESSED with this song, this songwriter, this voice!!! #sarabareilles #waitressthemusical I'll be completely honest... My two favorite voices - that I listen to daily to learn and grow and apply... Sara Bareilles is one and the other is @shellybortpresents... Listen to her voice and her songs... #gorgeousvoices

In Utah at the most gorgeous ranch house surrounded by family, dogs and horses!! #bliss! They are out fishing and I'm doing a little rehearsing (lots of shows coming up, yay!!) and recharging the soul with my beloved journaling! I don't get to it enough and I just need to schedule it in... P.S. don't you LOVE my sneaks?! Nothing better than Tiffany colored sneaks! #pianochick #chicksinger #lasvegas #journaling #fashion #tiffanys

So I'm reading the Marie Kondo book and it is very inspiring! I did this slightly out of order, but my BFF and I are doing what I'm calling Phase 1 prep. Lol! I'm tackling my "time takers"...I'm done with the wrong things taking up my time. More family, more music, more me! Not chores but things that uplift and bring joy! Feels amazing... Office next...
