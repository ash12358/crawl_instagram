The Feb / March issue of @CreativeReview is themed around ‚Äòhumour‚Äô, and you‚Äôll find me from page 68, talking about typography and how Gill Sans became the unlikely King of Comedy. I‚Äôm disproportionately proud of this one.¬†I design things that are published all the time, but this is the first time I‚Äôve had my own words published, and it feels like a big deal (although it‚Äôs surely not). I really enjoyed writing this, and would like to try my hand at writing more. We‚Äôll see. Fun fact: I was commissioned to write this after a bumping into the deputy editor of Creative Review in a pub. Pubs = Great opportunities. #Writing #Design #Typography #CreativeReview #GillSans

Sent this one off to print recently. My first cover for @pennedinthemargins.

I drink Coca-Cola almost every day. I know it is bad for me, yet I cannot seem to muster the will power to stop. This feels pathetic. I‚Äôm delighted that the Sugar Tax comes into effect today in the UK, and I‚Äôd like to see it go even further. An 8p increase isn‚Äôt going to stop me buying a can of Coke at lunchtime. I‚Äôd be in favour of a 100% tax on drinks with the highest sugar content. Fact magazine, volume one issue six, designed by Herb Lubalin, November 1964.

I designed these Father Brown covers back in 2013. This is perhaps the only project from that period that I‚Äôm still happy with. The illustrations have a deliberate nod to the work of Romek Marber, who was responsible for many iconic Penguin covers during the 60s, in particular the Penguin Crime series.  Marber designed a couple of Father Brown covers himself, elements of which have been incorporated into my own designs. #BookCover #BookDesign #Illustration #PenguinBooks #RomekMarber

A close-up of the stickers on the Marx and Marxism cover. The translations are: 1. ‚ÄòCommunism for Vietnam‚Äô 2. ‚ÄòWorkers of the world, unite!‚Äô 3. ‚ÄòForward, to the victory of Communism!‚Äô (set in Marvin, no less) 4. ‚ÄòLong live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought!‚Äô 5. ‚ÄòPeace, bread and earth‚Äô #BookDesign #BookCover #Illustration #Stickers #KarlMarx #Marxism #Translation

Another recent Pelican cover. This one is Marx and Marxism, published in April, conveniently just in time for Karl Marx‚Äôs 200th birthday. The book is split into two halves ‚Äî Part 1 is all about Marx, the man, and Part 2 is all about Marxism, the ideology, and its application in different times and places around the world. #BookCover #BookDesign #Illustration #Stickers #KarlMarx #PelicanBooks

Created some paintings with my daughter. My contribution was putting down some masking tape, and she chose the colours and made the marks. #art #painting #triangles

Last year my friend @mathieuloutre created a typeface ‚Äî Marvin Visions. It‚Äôs a revival of an old lettraset face ‚Äì Marvin ‚Äì¬†originally designed by Mick Chave in 1969. Mathieu‚Äôs interpretation is full of integrity ‚Äî¬†staying faithful to the spirit of the original Marvin, but improving consistency and spacing, and greatly expanding the character set to include diacritics and Cyrillic. As part of the typeface‚Äôs release, Mathieu asked me and a few others to create postcards to show it off. Here are my contributions. If you‚Äôre interested in Marvin Visions, Mathieu has a great write-up about the face and his design process over at: readvisions.com/marvin #type #typography #fonts

I've been doing a lot more illustration recently and am finally starting to feel half-happy with the results. This one is for an upcoming Pelican book called Think Again, which will be out in the Summer. #illustration #bookdesign #thinking #thinkingman #pelicanbooks

Another recent Pelican cover. Don‚Äôt worry, I had no idea what ‚Äòhermeneutics‚Äô meant either. Turns out it‚Äôs the philosophy of interpretation. The idea for the cover came from the penultimate paragraph of the book: ‚ÄúWe pass our lives mingling with the mystery, discerning what is being asked of us, struggling to name the shifting shapes of the clouds‚Äù. #BookCover #BookDesign #Illustration #GraphicDesign #Hermeneutics #PelicanBooks

I‚Äôm going to try and start posting more pictures of my work. If that‚Äôs not your thing then mute or unfollow accordingly. This is my Pelican cover for Being Ecological by Timothy Morton. Fun fact: Amazon rejected this cover because the artwork was pixelated and low res. #BookDesign #BookCover #illustration #GraphicDesign #BeingEcological #TimothyMorton #PelicanBooks

Flight home cancelled. Thanks a lot Easyjet. Work, family, commitments, be damned.  Spending some time in Toulouse's Jardin Japonais instead.
