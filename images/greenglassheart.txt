Here’s to the legend who, against the odds: graduated from college at 20, started an amazing career, raised a child as a single parent while working full-time and graduating at the top of her MBA class, and continues to be twice as funny as I could hope to be. Our personal lives were at times harder than you might think, but she is the single biggest reason my dreams could come true. Never forget where you came from and who you owe your privileges in life to 💜

Sup Henry. Happy birthday!! I'm thankful every day for the strange combination of circumstances that led us to meet. Thanks for always making me laugh, for challenging me, and for keeping the streak.

Several hundred people have just been admitted to #colgate2022. Wanted to reflect on my own experiences. I applied Early Decision elsewhere and it wasn’t a particularly joyous moment for me this time five years ago. I didn’t get into that college. I didn’t know it at the time, but I would go on to be rejected by another eight colleges in the United States and receive only one acceptance. When college application decisions are released every year, I am always filled with gratitude for the college in the middle of nowhere that took a chance on me. Colgate is not perfect, but it gave me opportunities I couldn’t even conceive as well as many friends. Unclear how things would have turned out if I ended up somewhere else, but I think we can say I turned out just fine here 👌🏼

True or false: I once ate 10 cream puffs in one sitting. (Answer: False. I ate 11.) ☺️

When you accept an opportunity in a state you've never been to and your mom thinks the city is "Cleverland"…two reasons we came to visit ☺️☀️

饮水思源 (when you drink water, remember the source) - graduated Magna Cum Laude yesterday with a double major in Political Science and International Relations. Had the opportunity to take fascinating courses, study off-campus twice, and served as the Senior Class President. I will be embarking on a brand new adventure in August by moving to a city I've never been to start work. I worked very hard these past four years, but I'm also cognizant of the various privileges I had in being able to attend Colgate, being able to make friends from different places easily, and being able to pick a career field totally different from the things I used to do. If you know me, you know I dislike the phrase "I couldn't have made it through this without you" because it's factually untrue in most cases, but I'll say it about my mom. Thank you, I love you. 💐🎓🎉💕

5 years ago, I ran for president of my high school student council and came dead last, netting only 23 votes among several hundred voters. I was majorly embarrassed and thought I'd never try to be in student government ever again. So glad I moved past that. Today was the senior class council's last meeting. I'm thankful that my members have been very reliable and committed and that we actually like each other, sort of. My job is not *quite* over yet, but I'm very blessed to have served as this year's senior class president!

It's problematic - for a variety of reasons - that feminine hygiene products aren't free. I hope Colgate changes this. In the meantime, I realized that I had a bunch of coins in random places in my room. Here's what I did with all my quarters for the women's bathroom by the library cafe. There are plenty of bathrooms on this campus with pad/tampon machines. So…if you have some coins lying around, wanna join? 💁🏻💁🏻💁🏻

At the beginning of 2016, Mark Zuckerberg publicly vowed to run 366 miles in the year, one for each day. I eat a lot of chicken nuggets and do plenty of unhealthy things, so I wanted to do something good for myself this year. I enjoy running - or to be more specific, I dislike other forms of exercise more - so I decided to make my own running goals. I thought 366 miles was a little much given my lack of running history, so I made half of that my target: 183 miles, or 295 kilometers. I run much slower than most people, but I haven't stopped doing what works for me. Pleased to say that I finished my 183rd mile of the year today! 🏃🏻‍♀️💪🏼🏁 #ayearofrunning

I have always been reluctant to call myself a runner because of how slow I think I am. My standard lame joke is that the only exercise I do is "run…for student government". I'm taking that back and owning this now. Today, I ran 10 miles on a running track. I took a picture in the same spot after every mile. This is the result. 🏃🏻🌅 #sunset #sunsetsfordays #beattheblerch

I was raised entirely by my mom. I may have wondered many times what it is like to have a father, or to have two parents involved in my life. That said, I have never felt less loved than others around me and this is a testament to my mom's dedication and fight to give the best to her daughter. I wonder how differently my life would have been, but I am happy with what I have as my reality. #happyfathersday because you deserve full credit and more when it comes to parenting. Thank you for everything.

Finished my last day in this office! Made many great friends, learned cool things, consumed good wine (but I wouldn't really know). Turned my fob in, packed away the spare pair of shoes under my desk, and stole my favorite mug from the office kitchen. Onto the next work adventure at the Institute for Policy Studies!

#happymothersday to the fiercely protective, resilient, selfless, and ingenious woman who went through 30 hours of labor for me. She did quite a lot of my homework in kindergarten (being careful to keep her handwriting as messy as possible) through second grade because she said she didn't believe in children having to work so hard at that age. Let's be real, she did it to boost my grades because Asian parents, am I right? Some things I got from my mom: an effective death glare, the conviction that makeup isn't necessary, and the ability to fall asleep in no time. 母亲节快乐, 我永远爱你. 😚❤️👯

I got this piece of advice from someone on the Washington Study Group last year - "make sure you actually become friends with the people in your study group, because at the end of the day, after work, they're who you have". ☺️😚💁🏻 #blessed
