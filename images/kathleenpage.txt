We made it to Ohio for our summer vacation! After a 5 hour car ride a kiddie pool full of water is the best 💙😀

We finally got to celebrate Mr. Gavin's 9th birthday with him after the littles were in California for 14 days. We can't believe he is nine... He is still missing his two front teeth, loves nerf guns & bacon 🤷🏼‍♀️. Bennett and Chloe might have missed the spotlight since they are used to always sharing birthdays 🎂 😂💙

Thank you to the Carrigan, Bourke and Simerson families for having me take photos of their sweet littles in Michigan over the last two days! We totally did piggy back rides, I might have done some bribery with Photo candy, and had a fun sleepover in the Carrigan’s new beachwalk home. Thank you all for making my job so much fun!!! 😍

Happy 9th birthday to Gavin Michael Williams! I’m so thankful for this spark of energy that is in my life now.

Well we did it. After meeting this man two years ago we are engaged & the date is set. He’s such a rockstar that while I was working Saturday morning, he somehow got all three munchkins dressed and drove an hour to take this photo for our save the date. We are getting married in Chicago, so I obviously insisted we take it in the city. It was so fun to hear the littles reactions to seeing the skyline for the first time from that location. He is a dream, along with the three bonus hearts that come with him ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I can’t believe it. My baby sister @momoney37 is graduating from New Trier! This little one is a fighter! I was looking for baby photos of her, but this one might be my favorite. She tried entering this world early, and my mom had to stay in the hospital on bed rest for 3 months. On the day of my 8th grade graduation, the only way to see my mom was to go to the hospital in my dress. Being without a mom, I totally forgot to paint my nails, and we had to fix that in the hospital room (that’s what Margaret is doing since she couldn’t bend over). It was a hard day to not have my mom at graduation, but it was so worth it and we are all SOOO thankful for Little Mo Money!! We love you and can’t wait for you to start your next adventure!!!

This past weekend Chloe had her Ballet/Tap dance photos. After we had so much fun doing our own little shoot at home. (I obviously needed to take my own version, learned that from my cousin!)

We lost a great one. You will be missed my sweet Grandma Page. We were so lucky to see you almost every Summer or Christmas growing up, and that you would even go mountain biking with us when you were over 70! I was lucky enough to live in Tucson with you for two years, and Sunday brunch was always a fun time. We all owe you gratitude for your sense of adventure, your creative spirit (and genes!) After being without Grandpa for almost 20 years, I am so happy you will finally be at peace & with him. Love you forever. 💕

Wow! Thank you all for an amazing @juniorleaguechi Perfect Pairings last night! A big thank you to our committee members, volunteers, JLC Staff, vendors, @chicagomuseumevents and all the amazing people that helped make it the largest event in our over 100 year history. We sold out at 800 tickets, had 32 tasting stations, 34 raffle baskets, and 36 wine pull bottles. Thank you all for your help raising money for our Community projects! We can not wait to share the photos, I took the night off and we had two fabulous people capturing the event. Thank you to my amazing co-chair, Hayley Rawers, that stepped up to help in January and we couldn’t have done it without her. Ruth Gallagher Nelson, I somehow forgot to get a photo with you, but we hope you enjoyed your last event before the end of your presidency. 😘 Cheers to Perfect Pairings 2018, we all hope to see you again next year! 🥂💙🌸#jlchicago (and thank you @ashwilli33 for putting up with me this month 😂)

We lost an amazing woman yesterday. Her work in the White house and as a #JuniorLeague member is inspiring ♥️ #Repost @juniorleague ・・・ As the nation mourns the loss of Barbara Bush, The Junior League reflects on her legacy with our organization. Long before her many years in Washington, Barbara Bush was a young wife in Midland, TX who, like many other newcomers to strange cities, joined the local Junior League to try to become part of the community. It worked. Barbara’s work at the Junior League of Midland (including helping to set up and run its thrift shop) also fits nicely with her lifelong embrace of voluntarism. A tireless advocate of literacy programs, she founded the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy (which has awarded $60 million in grants).

In 2016 a woman emailed me asking if I was available March 3, 2018. I asked her if she meant 2017.... she said no! Actually 2018! My daughter is having her Bat Mitzvah. Well the day finally came 💙 I had the pleasure of photographing portraits in the fall, temple photos last month, and the party with a photo booth last night. Thank you @crayzy.photography for clicking at the photo booth while I captured the party. I’ll miss this sweet family! It has been a pleasure capturing Rachel’s special day 💙

That feeling when you receive a package prints!! Thank you @smugmug & @bayphotolab for providing beautiful photos to my own home & my clients. My favorite part, the photos come flat! I have ordered prints before from other companies and they have come rolled up, pixilated and poor quality. I can’t recommend a professional printer enough. #myopinion #notsponsered now let’s get framing ♥️♥️♥️ @kathleenvirginiaphoto

Happy Thanksgiving!! I’m feeling #thankful that this year my business has had its best year yet, but most importantly, I had a wonderful year with these four turkeys. We finally took photos together last weekend in my new shared studio space located in Libertyville (that I’m super excited about!).

Today’s morning office: capturing the final photos for this beautiful Chicago Gold Coast penthouse designed by @konstantarchitecture + home.

Some how this lucky photographer got added to the media list. Capturing the Apple Michigan Avenue grand opening was as breathtaking as I would have ever imagined. I worked at the North Michigan Avenue store for two years coordinating events and it taught me so much for my job today.

I can’t even believe this day has finally come! #AppleNorthMichiganAvenue #NMA gets a new home. It’s a place close to my heart that I worked at for two years coordinating events. I was part of the first iPad launch at this store, and it still amazes me how much the world has changed since then. I can’t wait to see the new space and team at #AppleMichiganAvenue. I’m headed down to take photos. See you all later my fruit stand family! (And good bye to the only glass Apple Store window)

Today photographing the #eclipse2017... It might have been 90 degrees and sunny and I drove 12.5 hours... But it was cool and dark for 2 minutes & 30 seconds, I heard crickets think it was night & got some photos. It was worth every second 🌙 #eclipsetracker #eclipse2017 #canon5dmarkiv

Who needs a handyman when I have a handyman 💙 We are almost done with the shutter project. It turned into a little bigger of a project than we anticipated, but teamwork makes the dream work 🙌🏻💙
