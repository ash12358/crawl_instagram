Spent all morning laying sod on Nana‚Äôs grave with Boston and Grandpa. Grandpa said giving her a beautiful place to rest is our last gift to her on this earth. He called it our labor of love.

We didn't realize when we stopped at this historical gas station while supercharging in Shamrock, TX earlier this week that it was the inspiration for Ramone's body shop from the Disney movie "Cars." We had to go back and make sure to take better pictures to do it justice. They even have an old rusty tow truck that looks like Mater! Savannah was disappointed when she found out Mater didn't have a mouth. You can kinda see her disappointment in the photo. #TeslaRoadtrip

Just finished sampling three different vintages of peach jelly all made by family. Here are my reviews. (The winner is me) Mom's: It reminded me of a holiday dessert. Almost like a spiced peach jelly. Delicious. Diane's: Very bright peach flavor. Tastes like summertime. Very pretty appearance with peach chunks suspended perfectly. Double delicious. Papaw's: Less sweet in comparison to the other two, still maintaining strong peach flavor. Best spreadability of the three. Triple delicious.

Today is the one year anniversary of Shepard's first heart surgery at just 16 days old. The day of the surgery, we woke up super early after not getting enough sleep the night before and went to the hospital early to spend some time with him before the surgery, and his Papa Chet was already there holding him. I was such a nervous wreck that morning, everything the nurses were saying was going in one ear and out the other. All I could think about was baby Shep and wanting more than anything for him to come out okay. Thank God he did. I am confident the surgery was successful because of all the love and prayers for him and his team of surgeons. Thank you to everyone who has shown or sent love to our little fighter. Also thank you to the unknown family of the late child who donated the heart valve Shepard is using today. Today is a day to remind ourselves how blessed we are to be alive and how special it is to have such a strong little survivor as a son. Happy heartiversary Shepard! #heartiversary #22q #shepardpatrickbrown

Shepard is officially one year old, and what better place to celebrate #theboywholived than at Hogwarts! If you haven't seen him in over a month, you'd be amazed at the progress he has made in such a short time. He is now sitting up very well, eating everything in sight, rolling to all corners of the house, waving and smiling at complete strangers, and giving people rounds of applause just because. He is such a sweetheart. I have looked forward to this day, Shep's first birthday, since he was born. I know how many complications can arise in the first year, whether from his heart surgery or because of his 22q11.2 condition. Shepard has proven time and time again that he is a fighter and is tough enough to handle whatever this world throws at him. I am so thankful and proud that he is my son, you guys have no idea how proud. He is a light that will always shine through me. When I was driving Caroline to the hospital one year ago today, we listened to the Hamilton soundtrack the entire way (gotta start a new nation gotta meet my son). And now one year later, some of the music still speaks to me so well. Here is one part I still sing to Shepard. "(Shepard) When you smile I am undone, my son. Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for, there is so much more inside me now. (Shepard) You outshine the morning sun, my son. When you smile, I fall apart, and I thought I was so smart. I swear that I'll be around for you. I'll do whatever it takes, I'll make a million mistakes, I'll make the world safe and sound for you." #shepardpatrickbrown #22q

We took Sav on a date to eat lunch and see Beauty and the Beast today. She loved it. She would run into the aisle during every song and dance and twirl in her dress. She got many compliments on her dancing too. We also went in character, two beauties and a beast.

Shepard is 11 months old today! A bunch of new teeth have come in. Rolling around is his preferred method of transportation. He loves feeding himself, and his favorite food is now, by far, the Graduates lil crunchies cheetoh snacks. Seriously, he turns into an animal when we bust those out. Happy 11 months Shep! #shepardpatrickbrown #22q #11months

Shepard is 9 months old today, and he has been making great progress on numerous fronts. He is now able to completely roll over, and sometimes if we blink for a second he will have rolled himself halfway across the room. He is getting much better with his hands and loves the independence of being able to push buttons and spin the wheels on his toys by himself. He already has a few go-to toys that he considers his favorites. We are still working on getting his weight up and increasing the volume of his food intake. He loves food, just not in very large quantities yet, and his favorite food is probably Caroline's special yogurt/avocado mixture. Today is also the start of heart month. We are so thankful that his heart is doing so well and that he won't have to go through another surgery for at least a few more years. We're also thankful for all people who dedicate their lives to helping babies with heart conditions like Shep. The world can't have enough of these types of heroes. #22q #shepardpatrickbrown #chdawareness #chd

Shepard is 3 months old today! He loves when his sister takes care of him, and he is always smiling at mommy and daddy. He enjoys having deep conversations where he responds in coos too. We love you little Shepard! #theboywholived #shepardpatrickbrown #22q

Shepard is two months old today! We were able to bring him home on Tuesday so now our family is complete. He was sent home with an ng tube because he gets tired quickly from eating, and we feed him through it what he doesn't eat orally. Savannah is thrilled to have him home, and she's rarely left his side since he got here. She loves showing him her stuffed animals, dolls, shoes, bows, singing to him, and giving him big kisses. We are so happy to be making new memories now that our whole family is together. Happy two months Shep, my little hero. -- btw this is his concerned face that he makes often. üòØ #TheBoyWhoLived #ShepardPatrickBrown #22q

"I love the Harry Potter series for many reasons, but my favorite is because it teaches you that scars can make you extraordinary and even kids in the most devastating situations can live amazing lives." It's hard to believe but Shepard was born one month ago today. He has endured an open heart surgery and is still the most content and sweet little guy I know. He loves when mommy and daddy talk to him and sing to him. He also loves squeezing my fingers and when I play with his hair. He makes the most adorable squeaks and his eyes are already so incredibly expressive.  He has stolen our hearts and we cannot wait for the day we can bring him home. Thank you to everyone who has messaged us, commented, texted, or called letting us know you are thinking and praying for us. We appreciate each and every one of you! #ShepardPatrickBrown #TheBoyWhoLived #22q

We took Savannah to this restaurant when she was 6 months old and now that we're back we took her pic in front of the same fountain here. Maybe it's a new San Juan tradition for our family.
