A typical Spanish evening. People go out after work and have a glass of wine and some tapas. No matter what day of the week.

I like airports. For those who knows me well, knows that I struggle really hard with anxiety and panic-attack‚Äôs. But the weird thing is that I‚Äôm completely relaxed in places where even normal people freak out. That includes airports, IKEA and huge shopping malls. My theory is that it makes me feel normal. My anxiety and panic attack‚Äôs is usually pretty random and can come out of the blue. It has decreased immensely the last couple of years and especially since I stopped smoking for whatever strange reason. #anxiety #exposiontherapy #mentalhealth #anxietyreduction #vsco #munich #germany #traveler #peace #peaceofmind #mindfulness #thinkpositive #motivational #ceo #igers #igdaily #instafriends #instagood

One of my better food experiences in Cavtat. I think some of the places around Cavtat and Dubrovnik were incredibly overpriced and primarily coasted on good locations rather than food. My two favorite restaurant were the local one near my apartment, and this one. ‚ù§Ô∏è #food #restaurant #tavern #cavtat #cavtatbay #konavle #croatia #seafood #travel #traveler #backpacking #worldtraveler #cityscape #interiordesign #interior #restaurantinterior #vsco #vscocam #snapseed #adriaticcoast #hvala

A picture taken on one of many pit stops on my way to Zadar. Croatia is such a precious country. It still hasn‚Äôt been completely overrun and destroyed by tourism. Some parts, yes indeed unfortunately. But most parts is still Croatian in all ways possible.

Drove from Cavtat to Zadar today. It was about 3,5 hours to drive and had to pass the border to Bosnia to get to it. The trip took much longer tho, had two pit stops along the way. I have a very bad knee that keeps haunting me, so had to stretch my legs and walk around for an hour or two here and there. Anyways.. Zadar is just amazingly pretty. I‚Äôll post more pictures in my feed, but don‚Äôt want to spam it. I have arrived in Zagreb in a lovely apartment I found on AirBnB. Had a nice bath and getting ready to sleep. #zadar #zadar_region #zadaroldtown #oldtown #unesco #travel #traveler #worldtraveler #workhardplayhard #croatia #bosnia #adriatic #adriatictown #architecture #building #street #vsco #vscocam #snapseed #airbnb

I was really unlucky with the car I got from the rental company. Instead of a Volkswagen Golf, I got a Skoda.. which isn‚Äôt the same at all. I traded it in yesterday for this one instead. An Audi A3 1.6 TDI S-Line Automatic Quattro with S-Tronic. Wasn‚Äôt exactly cheap. But now I feel much safer on the road. Tbh, the Skoda was probably perfect for old people or casual drivers. But when 70% of my vacation and travel experience is from behind a wheel, I need something better. Today I‚Äôm taking this lovely car up to Sarajevo, Bosnia. #audi #audia3 #sline #tdi #quatteo #kotor #kotorbay #ferry #whitecar #luxurycar #luxuryrental #roadtrip #roadrage #audimotorsport #audilover #audilovers #audifamily #travel #worldtraveler #worldtravel

There are so many thing with this shot that totally amazes me as a Scandinavian. First off: Take a look at the ground. There is zero amounts of litter on the ground. In Norway a side street like this would be filled with all kinds of junk. The man standing under the arch with his back bent is not a heroin-addict, he is simply checking his iPhone. The level of architecture totally blows my mind. So many wonderful combinations and variations of stones and colors. Crna Gora is a real treasure. I kinda found it by luck because I had to pee on the way to Sveti Stefan. #montenegro #crnagora #kotor #risan #travel #traveller #architecture #stone #stones #oldtown #unesco #unescoworldheritage #worldtraveler #worldtraveller #gameofthrones #adriatic #city #cityexplore #vsco #vscocam #snapseed

Found a nice and more or less deserted beach in Split! Been shopping for a couple of hours. Getting ready to drive back home.. I just hope I get through the border.. I didn‚Äôt know that I was gonna gonna cross the border to get from Cavtat to Split... Luckily the border police showed me mercy and understood my little fuckup. However.. I hope they understand on the way back Aswell üôà #beach #panorama #nature #croatia #split #splitska #playa #pla≈æa #plaza #sand #sea #ocean #tranquility #peaceful

Had an amazing day. First a round trip in Dubrovnik by foot. Game of Thrones tour and self discovery of the old town after. Finished the evening in Cavtat where I walked all around the small island. Over 12000 steps, 8km walked, and 600kcal burned. My plans are set for tomorrow. I‚Äôm driving up to Split for some shopping and beach life. I‚Äôm considering one night in Split and then continuing to Zagreb the day after tomorrow.

What an incredible city. Dubrovnik is just beautiful. I‚Äôve been on a #gameofthrones Tour today and seen many places from Kings Landing, Red Keep, Karth, Black Water Bay and more.. I‚Äôve walked over 4km today and driven about 15km just one way. Not sure where I‚Äôll go after.

27 degrees Celsius in #Frankfurt barely arrived in time for my next flight to #Dubrovnik #Croatia .. so insanely looking forward to some alone time and a vacation solely on my own terms.. This is my 4th trip alone in the past year. My plans are ‚Äúsimple‚Äù. I‚Äôm renting cars and motorcycles and plan to drive all over Croatia, over the border to #Bosnia and #Montenegro and maybe even to #Sarajevo.

Times are changing, I am changing. I‚Äôve started opening my eyes to opportunities, and trying to get rid of habits, same old patterns and stuff I don‚Äôt actually need. I‚Äôm not trying to preach. But I do hope to inspire. My world was completely different a couple of years back. I was stuck, in every possible way. Stuck in bad habits, negative thinking and stupid decisions. Was a afraid of everything including myself.  But something in my life just changed, I got rid of things, people, certain social media. Everything that made me feel crap. It was a hard decision, and I lost ‚Äúfriends‚Äù along the way. And then, suddenly.. piece by piece positive things started to happen. And years later I‚Äôm standing tall. Back straight. And with so much wealth in all possible ways in my life. Making such a change doesn‚Äôt just happen by miracle. It starts with yourself. And it takes more strength than most can imagine. But it is possible. Whatever you think is impossible is more than possible for others. You can do it too. Trust me, you CAN do it too. #burudvann #B√¶rum #norway #hiking #nature #forrest #lake #portrait #portraitmode #vsco #vscocam #ceo #motivation #inspiration #businessmann #businesowner #speech #change #believe #youcandoit

Love this photo.. from my visit to gastrointestinal survey a few weeks back. They tried to sedate med three times with different things without any luck. But decided to go forth anyway. They had never experienced anything like this before üò¨ü§ó A nurse helped me take a photo. And the other one is laughing with joy and awe! #gastrointestinal #bacteria #stomach #ulcer #survey #deepthroat #vsco

Epic battles between good and evil happen every day all around us. Practically every statue that dates back more than a hounded years has fantastic deeper meaning to them. Fun fact: This statue was erected in 1638 to celebrate the end of a Swedish Invasion!

Mariendom sure had some treats from a not so distant past. Pope Bendict XVI (Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger) was ordained a priest right here. I imagine him flying around the halls with a paper hat on his head and pretending to be the pope while being teased by his fellow students. Or maybe he just sat there like the rest of us at school, yawning and secretly swiping right on everything with tits. #pope #belltower #mariendom #munichm #munchen #benedictxvi #bayern #bavaria #germany #travel #world #traveller #tourist #vsco #iphonex

I‚Äôve come to an age where I no longer care if I look like a tourist. I remember my greatest fear as a teenager was that people would think I was a Japanese tourist or something.. I just didn‚Äôt want to fit the stereotype. But now we live In a completely different world. We are no longer tourists. We are world travelers, businesspeople on inspirational and motivational trips. I feel blessed that I have this opportunity. I would thank that guy on the top of the stairs, but that wouldn‚Äôt be fair considering all my trials up through the years. I can appreciate it tho, and I admire people that have religion or faith in their lives. I believe in positive energy though. I believe that if you put positive energy out into the universe you will get it in return. #ceo #motivation #travel #businessmann #faith #jesus #god #catholic #parliament #munich #munchen #bayern #germany #bavaria #vsco #vscocam #purevape

I love empty streets. There is something mystical about them. Until you have walked them in your own shoes you have no idea what to expect. Maybe it leads to something awful. But in most cases it simply leads to something new. Something new you might have never seen or experienced before. Why walk the roads you‚Äôve taken over and over. Leading you to the same place over and over, and not even noticing the opportunities that might lurk around the corner. After a while you don‚Äôt even notice what‚Äôs around you or even who. Dare to take a different path. It actually might lead you to something wonderful. #motivation #motivationalquotes #munich #munchen #germany #purevape #street #streetphotography #emptystreet #darkstreet #city #citylights #vsco #vscocam

Ok. Love VGOD. But I was really really disappointed when they held off a brand new one for me. I was just going out to take out cash.. when someone actually sold it before I got back. They sold me however the last one they had. A limited edition VGOD Elite Pro Mod. A little bit chipped, so I got a sweater for free. I love the sweater but love the VGOD cases they come in more.. However. I hope that we can make a deal very beneficial for both parties in the future. @officialvgod #vgod @nosmoke_no @nosmokeoslo #purevape #purevapemunich #nosmoke #vapeshop #ceo #vgodfan #vapenorway #germany #vapeexpo #tourism #travel #business #businessmann #businesstrip

The streets of M√ºnchen centrum is absolutely packed with people. To be honest I‚Äôve never seen that many people in one place at the same time ever. Beats London, Birmingham, Barcelona.. this is actually a rather quiet street.

Ok. I was supposed to be put to sleep before my latest gastrointestinal survey here the other day. Problem is that I have a dna enzyme abnormality that makes me immune against an array of drugs. They tried three different sedatives without any effect. So we decided to go forth anyway just with a lot of local anesthetic spray down the throat. They said they have never experienced this before. I consider this my superhero-power. ‚ÄúLuckily‚Äù they found what we were looking for. Several scars from ulcers and testet positive for H. pylori which can cause an ulcer over and over as long as it exists. I‚Äôve been sent on a triple-cure to kill of the bacteria. #gastro #gastronomianatal #ulcer #medicine #pylori #chill #peace #drugs #badass #nochill #lol #deepthroat #stomach #pain #asian #hashtags #vsco #vscocam

It‚Äôs hard to imagine how people without 4WD gets around.. I‚Äôve had absolutely no problem up and about anywhere this winter. My first car set the standards pretty high. But this one? Gonna be really hard and expensive to compete with. I love this car so much that I‚Äôve ordered more or less a full body kit to make it even more unique. This is one of maybe a handful Audi S6‚Äôs who was factory delivered with an V6 Diesel engine. I‚Äôve only seen one other available at Finn. And it‚Äôs expensive as hell.. Always dreaming of new cars. Can‚Äôt help it. But I also have a crazy vision for this car. A little bit hard (and expensive) but I got an idea that looks insanely good in my head. Wonder how it will look IRL tho... imagine an RS6 crossed with a Ford Mustang Shelby.. üôà Crazy?

Rescued my cat from a tree today. With the help of B√¶rums Finest. Now am at IKEA while the Adrenalin still rushes through my vains. I didn‚Äôt want my cat to be frightened by the firefighters.

I miss the sun and warmth so much.. This is another throwback to my Mallorca trip last year. I actually drove that scooter from coast to coast. Was scary as hell on the highway. Especially at night. I actually drove off the road in the dark one night after being hit by the high beams of some a-hole. The scooter had surprisingly good speed tho. Measured it up to 120km/h at best. Went a little slower uphill but considering it was only a 125cc and had practically no sound at all it felt pretty alright. I love riding motorbikes in general tho. So I‚Äôm touch with the nature and the surroundings. You experience the world around you from a complete different point of view than from the inside of a car. Most likely going to buy a new motorcycle very soon. Can‚Äôt wait! #mallorca #scooter #palmademallorca #palma #vaping #vacation #majorca #vapingsavedmylife #peugeot #125cc

Sooo.. much snow.. it just won‚Äôt stop. Tried to excavate my other car earlier, but at no use. I hope it pops up in a few weeks naturally.. I‚Äôve also investigated into how much snow the roof can hold before it breaks. It‚Äôs almost 2 meters of snow right now outside my house. From what I‚Äôve been told, Norway hasn‚Äôt seen snow like this in 10 years.. so yeah. I sincerely hope that the saying is true. If it‚Äôs a lot of snow, it will be a warm summer. Can‚Äôt wait to get out of this snow hole.. two weeks until M√ºnich, and 3 months until Verona. But I can‚Äôt wait that long for some sun and warmth. Will try to squeeze in a vacation somewhere hot very very soon... #winterhascome #norway #snow #buried #scandinavia #nature

I‚Äôm bursting with happiness over how beautiful my shop has become. And incredibly grateful for all the positive feedback from our customers. We had our first Vapemeet since the opening last night and the party went on until tomorrow morning for some of us.. I just came back from work after tidying and cleaning..

Today I built a cathouse for my friend and employee @dita2112 . She was so anxious when her cat didn‚Äôt come inside before she went to work. So this is my contribution to make sure that her beautiful cat Vitani gets her own safe-place outside. #creative #cathouse #billy #ikea #wood #carpentry #carpenter #box #catsofinstagram

Shame to admit, but I had almost forgot my other car.. it has been dormant for so long.. but with lots of help by my good friend it‚Äôs finally back on the road with a new engine and new driving computer.

Trying hard to conceal the pain.. every part of my body aches and longing for a vacation of sorts. Gotta admit that returning for a full time-physical job has been harder than anticipated. I‚Äôm actually officially declared too sick to be available to work. But I like to prove them wrong. Truth is that without daily activity the body and mind withers even more. And even tho I know that the pain will only increase the next 4-5 months or so, I also know that in double that time.. my body and mind can withstand even more pain and maybe even forget about it a little. I have so many diagnosis, but none of them defines who I am or want to be. Only I can make that decision, and right now I choose to be awesome. #ceo #businessman #businessowner #motivation #pain #workhardplayhard #acceptance #profile #portrait #nosmoke #vaping #vapingsavedmylife

Throwback to #Mallorca 2017, this is from the rather deserted town Pollen√ßa which used to be a trade gathering-point. The city streets are more or less empty of both residents and tourists.

Throwback to Mallorca 2017 Gotta admit that the Audi A1 Sportsback was pretty boring compared to this beast, the Jeep Wrangler. It didn‚Äôt have the speed, but its size was pretty brutal. Driving through the city streets of Palma was pretty epic. I didn‚Äôt dare to go off-road tho, even tho I had some bumpy encounters on the countryside. I didn‚Äôt fire up this account before July this year, so feel I gotta update you guys on what I‚Äôve been up to prior to that.. #jeep #wrangler #mallorca #menorca #motor #audi #mustache #ceo #workhardplayhard #motivation #majorca #palma

Paws up! Weekend off and it feels a little weird. Ive been working so damn hard the last couple of months. It feels great to have things up and running. It‚Äôs my little baby right now, and even tho i know I‚Äôve left the shop in capable hands this weekend it feels like I‚Äôm missing out.

Last week has been one hell of a rush.. in all ways imaginable. Tbh I feel a bit high on all the experiences and haven‚Äôt quite landed yet. Have had trouble sleeping, eating and just being a normal person. But wow, what an experience! The good thing is that next time around I have more control and plans laid out. I had to make stuff up along  the way and just trust my instincts. I have a plan, and it will work! #ceo #businessowner #grunder #vaping #vapefam #vapelife #workhardplayhard #motivation

@nosmokeoslo Representing at today‚Äôs Christmas Vape Meet in Drammen! Was a lovely evening with lovely people. What I love the most about the vaping community is that people of all ages, races, background and social standing come together with one huge thing in common. We have all kicked the deadly habit of smoking. Vaping is more than just an alternative. It‚Äôs a way of life. It restores all bodily functions and gives you a better health. (Than smoking). In all honesty.. it‚Äôs hope. @dita2112 #nds #norskdampselskap #drammen #norway #vapelife #vapelyfe #vapefam #vapecommunity #vapingsavedmylife #abillionlives #vapewave

Met a lot of people I knew from before and mainly talked to companies I already have established relations to. I got so much work to do, so I‚Äôm probably gonna be at the office until late. My insurance company wouldn‚Äôt cover my old MacBook on the travel insurance, but said I could send it in again under another insurance I have, so it‚Äôs not a totally lost case yet. A small fee to pay inbetween but still nothing compared to the total cost of a new MacBook these days. #macbook #gowork #goworkcoworking #nosmoke #nosmokeoslo #randholding #businessowner #ceo

Apparently I have a fetish for expo‚Äôs. Today is Gr√ºndermessen/Business Expo in Oslo. Insanely small compared to the other expo‚Äôs I‚Äôve been to all over Europe this year. I haven‚Äôt looked at the itinerary yet, and not sure what I‚Äôm looking for, but that‚Äôs part of the point. See what opportunities that presents itself when your not looking.

Okay. I had no choice but to buy a new #MacbookPro since the other was involved in a nasty cocoa incident. It cost me my vacation next week, but I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to work without a computer anyways, so it had to be prioritized. If the insurance covers it.. (hopefully) I might be able to leave anyways if I find new tickets at a reasonable price. Oh well. New Mac new opportunities! #macbook #apple #macbookpro #gowork #goworkcowork @goworkcowork #nosmoke #nosmokeoslo #randholding

Working from home turned out to be impossible due to three cats who has decided to stay indoors for the entire autumn and winter.

Feeding my #AppleWatch with some activity. Yes. I‚Äôm actually that lazy that I need something like AppleWatch to remind me to be active throughout the day. I‚Äôve figured it‚Äôs impossible to work from home, so Ive rented an office throughout 2017 until I get my shop in Oslo up and running. Can‚Äôt wait to begin.. I‚Äôll be spending almost whole of December refurbishing the entire inventory to make it look like a million bucks. I promise you an amazing shop with quality products at insanely good prices. I feel so blessed to be part of this amazing venture. Being a part of so many lives and helping them quit smoking. It‚Äôs an amazing journey to be part of. Please check out my company page on Instagram aswell @nosmokeoslo I will make sure to keep you all updated on the progress. #asker #b√¶rum #akershus #hilton√•sen #norway #sunset

Insanely cold and slippery up here.. both cars and humans has been sliding back and forth all day.. just switched to winter-tires, but hardly made any difference..
