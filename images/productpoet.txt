I might be biased, but doesn’t this glaze just amaze? 🐷🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Okay okay, so I promised y’all that I’d show you how my spare ribs turned out before they were devoured. So drumroll please....what started off with @kosmos.q killer bee rub, ended up being wrapped in brown sugar, parkay and honey and the finally one rack gazed with cherry apple habanero rib glaze and the other two with @myron.mixon’s hog sauce. These were so tender that the bones were just falling out. Mmm mmm good. ———————- #smokedribs #ribs #spareribs #porkribs #pork #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #eatingfortheinsta #instayummy #zipkick #eeeeeats #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamado #minnstagram #minstagramers #minnstagrammers #zipkick #pitmaster #grillmaster

It’s a ribs on ribs on ribs kinda day. I totes magotes say yay!!! 🐷🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- Time for another three racks of ribs so that way the lads have plenty of leftovers for the week. I started off with some @kosmos.q Honey Bee rub and then I’ll finish off these bad boys with some rib glaze and BBQ sauce.

Time to season my new grates. Don’t they look great! ♨️🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- One of my fav things about Instagram is finding cool products, especially when it comes to my food smoking addiction. Thanks to @thegrillingorilla’s awesome feed, he got me hooked up with @the_burn_shop and they created these amazing grates for me. One for my @biggreenegg and one for my @kamadojoe. But first things first before I can cook on these beasts, I gotta season them. First I washed them with soap and water. Dried them and heated up the smokers to 350 Fahrenheit. Then applied a thin layer of oil to both sides of the grate. Oil and repeat every 30 minutes for total seasoning time of 2 to 3 hours. Now I just have to decide what I’m going to smoke today! ———————- How rad are these grates? ———————- #pitmaster #grillmaster #castiron #theburnshop #grilling #bbq #bbqnation #barbecue #barbeque #kamado #kamadojoe #grillgrates #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #smallbusiness #eatingfortheinsta #instayummy #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #egghead #minnstagrammers #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #zipkick

Since y’all did beg, here’s my smoked salmon deviled eggs. 🥚🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- Okay okay I heard the please. I know I was such a tease by first showing Salmon smoking, then some smoked eggs and then finally the salmon fully smoked. You didn’t think I’d leave you hanging did ya? Well here it is, my smoked salmon deviled eggs. Yep, that’s right. I took those smoked deviled eggs, deviled then eggs, topped with a little smoked paprika and topped it off with the smoked salmon. I literally ate about four of these as I was making them. So darn delish ———————- What type of deviled eggs do you like? ———————- #smokedsalmon #smokedfish #deviledeggs #fish #salmon #instayummy #eatingfortheinsta #nomnomnom #pitmaster #grillmaster #kamadojoe #kamado #kamadogrill #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #buzzfeedfood #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #zipkick

Just like my sliced brisket, at times I’m thin, at times I’m thick. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I gotta tell ya, this brisket nearly gave me a heart attack. Not from the meat or the taste, but because of how long it took for this 9 pound flat to get out of the stall. I wasn’t sure if I was going to have dinner at all. Anyways...I digress. After hitting 165 I wrapped in butcher paper and then I had a nice 6 hour stall. Whoa says me. Alas finally I was out of the stall and in to the cooler for a nap. Personally I would have waited an extra hour, but after one hour of my brisket napping I was so hungry I just had to slice. I then drizzled with a little bbq sauce and dug in. It was amazin’. ———————- Sauce or no sauce for your brisket? ———————- #brisket #smokedbrisket #beef #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #egghead #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #grillmaster #pitmaster #bbqnation #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #eatingfortheinsta #instayummy #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #eatthisnotthat #mnbbq #mneats #mnfoodie #mplsfoodie #mplseats #zipkick

To conquer my famine, I smoked a fresh salmon. 🐟🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Well I kind of teased ya the other day when I was smoking this salmon. It would only be proper and prudent of me if I at least made you drool a little bit with the final product! I ended up pulling his out of the smoker at about 3 1/2 hours as sometimes I smoke to a color versus time. This color was just divine. BUT wait a second, what about those smoked eggs. You’re just gonna have to wait a little longer to see my fish and egg collaboration. It’ll be eggcellent. ———————- Do you like raw salmon such as sashimi or sushi? ———————- #salmon #smokedsalmon #fish #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #mplsfoodie #barbecue #barbeque #bbq #bbqnation #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #mnfoodie #buzzfeedfood #smokedfish #zipkick #eatingfortheinsta #nomnomnom #instayummy #pitmaster #grillmaster

Have no fears or doubts, sometimes I’ll make Brussels sprouts. 🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Who needs a stovetop when you’ve got a grill top? All I needed was some olive oil, salt and pepper, Brussels sprouts and my @lodgecastiron skillet. Cooked these for about 20 minutes and then sautéed them in some Thai chili sauce. BUT don’t forget to take out your smoking wood like me or your veggies might be a little smoky. ———————- What are some of your favorite vegetables to grill or smoke? ———————- #castironskillet #castiron #lodgecastiron #brusselsprouts #grilledveggies #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #egghead #eatingfortheinsta #grillmaster #pitmaster #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #mplsfoodie #mplseats #instayummy #mneats #mnfoodie #zipkick

For lunch, dinner or a picnic, I’ll feed your soul with my brisket. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- This weekend I was rolling up smoke in my Big Green Egg while I was also smoking salmon, eggs and roasting coffee in my Kamado Joe. I started off by trimming this flat and then injecting with @kosmos.q reserve blend. I then topped it off with some @croixvalley rub and then put it in the fridge for an overnight nap. I then fired up the smoker and set to 225 Fahrenheit, added Apple and White Oak for my smoke. At around 165, I wrapped in pink butcher paper until the internal temp hit 205. I then wrapped in a towel in threw into my cooler until slicing time. Total cook time was 12 hours. ———————- Do you love sliced brisket or burnt ends? ———————- #brisket #beef #smokedbrisket #kosmosq #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #kamado #kamadogrill #kamadojoe #eatingfortheinsta #grillmaster #nomnomnom #instayummy #minnstagrammers #minnstagram #minnstagramers #eatthisnotthat #mnbbq #mneats #mnfoodie #mplsfoodie #mplseats #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #f52grams #eatthisnotthat #zipkick

Smoked chicken legs or a smoked chicken eggs? 🐔🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Yesterday I was smoking some salmon and I said to myself, “Self, what goes well with smoked salmon?” And self replied, “How about smoked eggs?” Well I think self is pretty smart. But this is not an optical illusion. There are no shells on these eggs, just a wonderful oak smoke ring. First, I medium boiled my eggs and then peeled them. Next, I set up the smoker for 225 Fahrenheit and threw in a nice chunk of white oak. Smoked ‘em for an hour and voila, smoked eggs. Bet you can’t wait to see what I did with these! ———————- Have you ever smoked eggs before?

🎶 They see smoke rollin’, they hatin’, patrollin’ they try to catch me smokin’ dirty 🎶 ———————- When it comes to smoking anything I always try to make sure I’m running a clean smoke. Today I’ve got salmon smoking on the Kamado Joe and a brisket rolling smoke in my Big Green Egg. I’ll smoke this salmon at 225 over alder wood for four hours. Then I’ll maybe smoke up some eggs and make some deviled eggs and top it off with the salmon. Mmmm. I just drooled a little. ———————- #salmon #fish #smokedsalmon #thesmokypoet #minnstagrammers #mplsfoodie #barbeque #barbecue #bbq #kamadojoe #kamado #kamadogrill #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #mnfoodie #buzzfeedfood #minnstagrammers #minnstagram #minnstagrammers #smokedfish #zipkick #eatingfortheinsta #nomnomnom #instayummy #pitmaster #grillmaster

I just had to say, “Happy National Fried Chicken Day!” 🍗🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- It’s not #throwbackthursday, but thought I’d do a throwback fried chicken for #NationalFriedChickenDay. Here is a whole bird from @revivalmn and is their Southern fried version. They also have a Tennessee hot (which packs a punch), a poultrygeist (think of your mouth on fire) and a gluten-friendly version too! You can also get a 2 piece, 2 piece white meat, a half bird or the whole bird. Make sure you get some of their awesome sides. ———————- How spicy do you like your fried chicken? ———————- #nationalfriedchickenday🍗 #friedchicken #chicken #pollo #mnfoodie #mplsfoodie #foodporn #eeeeeats #feedfeed #onthetable #eatdrinkdishmpls #foodgram #eatfamous #forkyeah #buzzfeedfood #foodiegram #f52grams #foodgawker #thekitchn #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #biggreenegg #kamadojoe #huffposttaste

Just got some new sauce & rub to add to my sauce & rub tub. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Just opened up my 1st subscription box from @bbq_rub_club. This @wrightbbqco sauce and rub sound dynamite.

Plant-based burgers? “Impossible,” you say! But this one was great today. 🍔🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Since the @cityofeagan’s 4th of July parade was cancelled due to a nasty thunderstorm (shakes first at sky) I headed to @mallofamerica and to @wahlburgers! Now I’ve heard about that Impossible Burger before and sometimes it’s impossible to find, but just as the skies opened and the sun came out, I find it on the menu (cue the harp music). This Impossible Burger was topped with smoked cheddar, caramelized onions, lettuce and a tomato (which I promptly discarded and said Nope) and Paul’s Wahl sauce. And I gotta tell you, this plant-based Burger was magical and fantastical. And the fries and sweet potato tots sand the Wahlbrewski were amazing too. ———————- Have you tried and Impossible Burger yet?

Here’s my smoked nuts & cheese, it’s amazing & does so please. 🧀🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- So about a month ago I smoked up some gouda, cheddar and Colby Jack and after a long, three or so weeks of aging, I finally broke into my stash. It was like the clouds parted and I heard harps being played from the sky. Purely heavenly. Add a little of my specialty rosemary smoked nuts and a side of cotton candy grapes and this smoky cheese platter turned out great. ———————- Have you ever tried cotton candy grapes before?

Your tummy will be pleased with my smoked baked mac & cheese. 🧀🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- When it comes to bbq, you always need a side dish or two.  So for my lad’s 21st birthday this past weekend, he really wanted some mac & cheese. This beast of a dish includes 6 cups of Barilla rotini pasta, 3 1/2 cups of milk, 1 1/2 sticks of butter, 6 beaten eggs, 8 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, 1 cup of shredded Parmesan and some chipotle chili powder. ———————- Using peach wood as smoke, I baked for 40 minutes at 350 Fahrenheit and then cranked the heat up to 500 for 10 minutes to get a nice cheese crunch. It was golden, Pony Boy. ———————- How do you make your mac & cheese? ———————- #macandcheese #macandcheesefest #macncheese #smokedmacandcheese #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #bbq #bbqnation #barbecue #barbeque #pitmaster #grillmaster #zipkick

For my lad who turned 21, six slabs of ribs when they were done. 🐷🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- In the great words of Matthew McConaughey, “Alright alright alright.” After a little over six hours of smoking, wrapping and saucing, my spare ribs were literally falling off the bone when I moved them to the cutting board. They were so tender that it made cutting them a little harder. From the meat selection, to the rub to the sauce, these ribs turned out amaze balls. And thanks to Heath Riles, my new saucy trick was to add a little warmed apple jelly into my bourbon bbq sauce. You may resume your drooling. ———————- What type of bbq sauce do you love? ———————- #ribs #smokedribs #babybackribs #babybackrib #spareribs #sparerib #bbq #bbqnation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #pork #porkribs #bourbon #kamadojoenation #kamadojoe #kamado #kamadogrill #mnbbq #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #f52grams #eatthisnotthat #zipkick

You will drool in drabs & dribs, once I smoke you my ribs. 🐷🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- So this weekend my eldest lad turns 21 so I’m smoking up a bunch of ribs for him and his friends. Started off with full spare ribs and trimmed them down to a St. Louis style rib. Should have saved the breast plate for rib tips, but whoopsies I threw them out in my euphoria while trimming.

When I took a bite of this lamb, I drooled and said, “Dammnn.” 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- One of my favorite things to make in my smoker or to eat is lamb. Sometimes it’s a lamb chop or a lamb roast stuffed with garlic and rosemary. When eating lamb chops I always ask my my chops to be cooked medium rare. Usually that is how they should be prepared.

I love spatchcock chicken. All ‘twas left was bone pickin’s. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- A lot of folks get intimidated by spatchcocking a chicken. It’s really easy to do and this is one of my favorite was to make chicken in the smoker. I have an IGTV video on how spatchcock one, but basically you use a kitchen shear and cut out the back bone and then lay flat. ——————— For this bird I rubbed my bird and then put it into a fridge for a nap. I then set my smoker to 300 degrees for direct cooking and then put my bird skin side down for 20 Minutes. Flipped over and sauced with @blueshognation. Smoked for another 20 and then alternated flipping and saucing for 10 Minutes each time until internal temp of the beasts hit 165.

More smoked cheese? Oh yes please! 🧀🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Okay okay, so I smoked some other cheese about a month ago. That time is was gouda, cheddar and Colby jack. Last night it was mozzarella and provolone. These two cheeses when smoked are so darn good and tasty. Shred them and make a smoky lasagna. Cold smoked these bad boys with apple pellets for two hours.

I do hate to boast, but here is another perfect coffee roast. ☕️🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Ordered up some fresh green beans from @sweetmarias and roasted 3 pounds of coffee yesterday. I went for a medium dark to dark roast on this blend of Brazilian. Guatemalan and Costa Rican beans. Each pound took about 25 Minutes to get into the second crack. Dome temp was holding steady at 500 degrees. By end of day tomorrow I’ll be able to grind and drink a great cup of coffee. ———————- Have you ever tried to roast coffee at home?

Who wants dibs on these beef short ribs? 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- When it comes to making ribs, I love beef ones. Both short and Dino bones make me very very happy. I picked up these ones from Whole Foods and fired up my Big Green Egg to cook them low and slow. After what seemed like a bazillion gazillion hours, they were done.

I say no meat today! Don’t these cupcakes look great? ———————- Okay okay, I know what you’re saying. Where’s the beef? Well I’ve been traveling the past couple of days so my smokers have had a little break. When traveling I have to be careful because I have a really really big sweet tooth. But it’s so hard to pick out one so sometimes I make a little sample plate and take a one bite out of a few. But then I feel bad for not eating all the rest. ———————- What is your favorite cupcake? ———————- #travelgram #travel #roadwarrior #traveling #f52grams #cupcakes #cupcake #dessert #desserttable #desserts #dessertporn #cupcakeporn #meringue #chocolate #redvelvet #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #eatfamous #eatthisnotthat #eatingtwincities #eeeeeats #eatfamous #feedfeed #feedyoursoul

Right now I would totally beg, for a burger topped with an egg. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet • Sometimes when I’m eating a burger, I love having a burger topped with a fried egg.

Went to @thewebergrill for my brisket fill. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet • When walking around downtown Indianapolis, I came upon @webergrills restaurant The Weber Grill. They had a lot of tasty things to try and I was really hoping for beef ribs. Alas, beef ribs were not my fate was their smoked beef brisket. Slow smoked for 12 hours over hickory wood makes this brisket really good. • While the flavor was really good and I loved the BBQ sauce, I would have preferred a little thinner slice. You get four choices of side dishes and the steamed spinach was really delicious. • What are some of your favorite BBQ sauces? • #thewebergrill #weber #webergrill #brisket #smokedbrisket #beef #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #bbqnation #pitmaster #grillmaster #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #egghead #eggheadnation #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #mnbbq #indyfood #indyeats #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #forkyeah #eatfamous #indygrammers

Take a look at the awesome pic I took. This is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. #Indy500 ——————— I know I know. It’s not a BBQ pic, but what the heck.

My tummy was filled with my bacon burger grilled. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I have to say, I love a good burger. An normally the only way I’m eating a bacon burger is either with turkey or beef bacon. And I’ll top this off with some vegan gouda cheese. And will the Kamado Joe divide and conquer system, I can use my griddle on one side for the bacon and the cast iron on the other side for grilling. Then I’ll top my burger with lettuce, pickles and catsup.

My tomahawk steak turned out juicy and great! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Whether you call it a tomahawk steak or a cowboy ribeye, either way this is one cut you have to try. Normally I go low and slow until the internal, smoking on indirect heat until the internal temp is around 115 Fahrenheit. Then I pull off and let rest while my smoker heats up to over 500 degrees. Then it’s on to a reverse sear for about 2-3 minutes on each side until my internal temp is about 135 for medium rare or 145 for medium. This bad boy was a medium cook and about 10 bites was all I took...then I wanted another one.

I wasn’t sure what to eat, so I emptied the freezer and made some meats. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Sometimes I don’t realize I have a bunch of tasty meats to eat buried in my freezer chest.

I just love to cobble up a cobbler to gobble! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I don’t know about you, but I love making (and eating) a fruit cobbler in my Cast iron Dutch oven. Definitely cover it up to prevent it from getting any residual smoke and as always when making a bread or dessert, start with some fresh clean charcoal. ———————- This cobbler is just a bunch of blueberries, blackberries and black cherries, add some sugar, butter, flour, baking soda and love and you’ll have an awesome cobbler on your hands and in your belly. ———————- #cobbler #blueberrycobbler #cherrycobbler #dessert #desserttable #justdesserts #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #smoker #pitmaster #grillmaster #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #kamado #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamadojoenation #fogocharcoal #rockwoodcharcoal #mplseats #mplsfoodie #mnfoodie #mneats #forkyeah #f52grams #feedyoursoul #zipkick #castiron

Alder wood & Salmon brined, turns out smoked & is sublime. 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- When it comes to smoking Salmon, there are just a few things I need. A great brine, some alder wood and a Kamado smoker. For my brine, there are a lot of different ingredients ranging from soy sauce to Sriracha. And for my wood, I only use alder wood which is the traditional Salmon smoking wood of the Pacific Northwest in the US. ——————— I’ll set up my Big Green Egg or Kamado Joe for indirect cooking at 225 Fahrenheit. I’ll then put an aluminum pan over my heat deflectors and then put my salon onto a frogmat on top of a grate.

From Murray’s Steaks, the smoked beef sandwich is really great. 🔥🥩#thesmokypoet ———————- Last week I attended my first @twins game of the year. And wouldn’t you know it, the Item of The Homestand was from legendary Murray’s Steaks. Normally their steak sammich is awesome, but today the smoked beef sammich was low and slow cooked brisket. And I have to say the sammich was worth the price of the ticket. Freshly sliced before your eyes and then served with an awesome bun and a side of chips.

Did you know you can roast coffee in your Kamado Joe? 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I’ve been doing a lot of reading about how to roast coffee in a Kamado smoker. All I needed was some fresh green coffee beans from @sweetmarias, a coffee roasting tumbler, clean burning charcoal and my Kamado smoker. ———————- Here I have a blend of Brazilian, Guatemalan and Colombian coffee beans. For his roast I used my JoeTisserie and had my Kamado Joe at around 425-450 degrees. The key to roasting coffee is to wait for the first crack of the beans for a medium roast and then the second crack for a medium-to-dark roast. For my first time, it took me about 25 Minutes for the first crack. Next time I’ll wait for the second crack as I tend to like darker roasted coffee. Just have to make sure I don’t burn the coffee means. Know what I mean? ———————- Have you ever roasted your own coffee?

And then today it is National Cheese Day! Well even though I’ve smoked all of these delicious blocks of cheese, I have to wait at least three weeks before eating.

Hope this doesn’t sound too far-flung, but today I am smoking beef tongue. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Beef tongue is always an interesting item to eat. Sometimes it’s prepared great and other times it can taste rather gamey. If simmered correctly, it can be amazing. For this beef tongue, I actually put it into my Instapot with water, cloves, salt, bay leaves and peppercorns. Then I cooked it, took the skin off and put in into the fridge for a nap. Next I’ll rub it and put it into the smoker with pecan wood. I’ll smoke at 225 Fahrenheit until the internal temp hits around 150. ———————- How do you prepare your beef tongue? ———————- #beef #beeftongue #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #bbqbeef #barbequebeef #barbecuebeef #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #kamado #kamadogrill #kamadojoe #kamadojoenation #fogocharcoal #kickashbasket #zipkick #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #forkyeah #eatfamous #eatingtwincities #mnfoodie #mneats #mplseats #mplsfoodie

Tonight I tried Hardcore Black for the first time. I have to say I found it divine. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- At first I didn’t know what to expect when I ordered @hardcorecarnivorerub’s Black rub. With salts, peppers and activated charcoal, it gives a unique look and flavor to your steaks. Today I tried them on both a ribeye and a NY strip steak. And they both turned out great. ———————- What are you cooking up this weekend? ———————- #hardcordcarnivore #rubs #steak #ribeye #nystripsteak #jesspryles #meat #meatlovers #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #kamado #kamadogrill #kamadojoe #kamadojoenation #forkyeah #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #pitmaster #grillmaster #egghead #minnstagrammers #minnstagram #minnstagramers #f52grams #fogocharcoal #kickashbasket

B is for BBQ as well as Bacon! I say Happy National Donut Day! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Today is National Donut Day and I gotta say, I love donuts and I totally love BBQ. That’s why this maple bacon donut is always one of my favorites to see, because it reminds me of making bacon on one of the smokers and then eating fresh maple syrup on a big pile of pancakes. ———————- What are your thoughts on adding meats on to donuts? ———————- #nationaldonutday #nationaldonutday🍩 #doughnuts #donuts #bacon #bacondonut #donutlovers #tryitordiet #eeeeeats #devourpower #forkyeah #spoonfeed #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #minnstagram #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #pitmaster #grillmaster #baconnation #instafood #desserts #f52grams

You know what’s really yummy? It’s my thick cut pastrami. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Sometimes when I make pastrami, I just can’t wait for it to cool down. I just have to slice it and eat it right away. It’s soooo good. I also like to sometimes slice it a little thick as compared to nice and thin for sandwiches. For this pastrami, all I needed for season was a little olive oil, some Montreal steak seasoning and a whole lotta love. ———————- When you make pastrami, do you like to brine or just go with a dry rub? ———————- #pastrami #pastramisandwich #cornedbeef #beef #smokedmeat #fogocharcoal #kamadojoenation #minnstagrammers #bbq #biggreenegg #kamadojoe #kamado #kamadogrill #biggreeneggnation #egghead #minnstagram #minnstagramers #forkyeah #yougottaeatthis #zipkick #f52grams #eatingtwincities #mneats #mplseats #mplsfoodie #mnfoodie #eatfamous #barbecue #barbeque

I can never lose, with which smoker I choose. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I have to say I just love cooking anything on either my Big Green Egg or my Kamado Joe. They are both awesome cookers and one can cook so many different things. From desserts to awesome meats, there isn’t anything that can’t be beat. ———————- However, there are some awesome offset and pellet coolers out there too.

Let’s celebrate Memorial Day with a steak of the U.S.A. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I came across this picture and I don’t know who to credit, but it just seemed so darn appropriate as we celebrate Memorial Day. One of my late grandfathers was in the Army during World War II and the other one worked on an naval base in Washington where he worked to repair the ships that came back from Pearl Harbor. And my uncle served is also a veteran. Needless to say, I’m thankful for their service as well as every active, retired, deceased, or reserve service personnel that helped to protect us near and far. ———————- Have you ever served in the armed forces or have a family member who has?

This isn’t a crock, you’ll love my spatchcock! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Tonight was another spatchcock chicken and if you have never spatchcocked a chicken yourself, it’s easy to do. Just grab kitchen shears, flip your bird on to its breasts and cut along either side of the back phone. Then flip back over and press down on the collar bone to flatten. It’s a great way to make a chicken. ———————- Today’s chicken was first rubbed with @caribeque’s All Purpose rub and then glazed in the smoker with @blueshognation BBQ sauce. So juicy and sooo good. ———————- Have you ever tried to spatchcock chicken? ———————- #chicken #pollo #spatchcock #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #wickedcharcoal #kickashbasket #bbqchicken #barbequechicken #barbequechicken #bbq #bbqpit #bbqlife #bbqporn #eats #egghead #eeeeeats #eatingtwincities #mnbbq #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #twincitieseats #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers #zipkick

Who has dibs, on these ribs? 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- It’s hotter than heck outside, but that doesn’t stop the pitmasters at the MN BBQ Society’s Spring Training from making a delicious lunch for all of today’s participants.

Time to cut some pork. Please bring a fork. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Today I am hanging out at the MN BBQ Society’s annual spring training. This was originally scheduled for mid-April but that darn apocalypse moved it to today. Which was okay! Time to process a hog and then go through the science of meat. ———————- What is your favorite cut of pork? ———————- #mnbbqsociety #mnbbq #mnbbqcrew #pork #porkchops #porkbelly #porkshoulder #mnpork #uofmn #getinmybelly #bbq #bbqlife #barbecue #barbeque #kamado #biggreenegg #kamadojoe #primogrill #traegernation #biggreeneggnation #kamadojoenation #mneats #mplseats #twincitieseats #zipkick

My tomahawk lunch snack, I am about to attack. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I went low and slow on my tomahawk steak until it hit an internal temp of 130. Then I opened up all the vents and dropped ‘er down on to the cast iron grate for the reverse sear. And when I dug in for my lunchtime attack, my eyes did flutter because it tastes like butter. ———————- If you love tomahawk steaks like me, how do you prepare them in your smoker? ———————- #tomahawksteak #cowboyribeye #steak #beef #hyvee #lowandslow #pitmaster #grillmaster #kamadojoe #kamadogrill #kamado #kamadojoenation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #egghead #fogocharcoal #kickashbasket #mneats #mnfoodie #mplseats #mplsfoodie #twincitieseats #minnstagram #minnstagramers #minnstagrammers

Oh you betcha, I’m making porketta! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- One of my favorite pork recipes to make is a wonderful porketta. Start off with a great Boston butt, a wonderful fragrant paste, a little nap in the fridge overnight and then smoked until just right. ———————- How do you like your pork smoked up?

Here’s a quick dish to make, shaved fennel & a seared tuna steak. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- Now you know I’m a hardcore carnivore, but sometimes mixing it up a little bit with a tuna steak can turn a meh meal into something great. ———————- My fennel has been simply shaved with a mandolin and tossed with olive oil, lemon and a little salt. Add a little Parmesan cheese if you’d like along with a little thyme. As for my tuna steak, this was marinated in soy sauce and then seared for just a couple of minutes on each side. ———————- What are some of your favorite fish to smoke or grill? ———————- #tuna #fish #tunasteak #grilling #smoking #pitmaster #grillmaster #biggreenegg #kamadojoe #biggreeneggnation #kamadojoenation #fennel #forkyeah #bbq #bbqlife #barbecue #barbeque #smokedfish #mneats #mnfoodie #foodhunter #mplsfoodie #mplseats #twincitieseats #zipkick

Smoking some peppers, makes fajitas taste better. 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- When I was a lad Poet, I used to eat so many stuffed green peppers. I was told “It will make you stronger and feel better.” 40 years ago all I remember was green peppers. Never red, yellow or certainly orange. ———————— Today with so many fresh food options, I love to smoke or fry up peppers in the smoker for fajitas or to diced them up for omelettes. And you can even stuff them with your favorite meats and smoke them too.

Your lips you’ll be lickin’, for my beer sittin’ chicken. 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- Sometimes I’ll use my @trompo_king, rotisserie or spatchcock. Other times I’ll use my sitting chicken.

A little cobbler dessert, can never hurt! 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ———————- I definitely love to make desserts in my smokers. From pies, to cobblers to donuts.

Enjoyed my first cook with @caribeque. The Jamaican Jerk was tasty too. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- After receiving my first shipment of Caribeque, I just had to try some.

My beef bacon is done! Now it’s time to sizzle some. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- After almost five days of curing, my beef bacon is now done. Smoked it over hickory wood for about 3 1/2 hours until the internal temp hit 150. Then put it back into the fridge and sliced it up this morning. ———————- Unlike thick slab pork bacon, the key to cooking in the pan is getting a thin slice. Otherwise it may get a little chewy. Flavor wise it turns out great, especially for someone like me that doesn’t eat pork bacon. Sizzles great in the pan and my whole house smells like bacon! ———————- #barbecue #barbeque #foodstagram #baconnation #bacon #beefbacon #bbq #bbqbeef #bbqlife #bbqlifestyle #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #hickory #hickorysmoked #fogocharcoal #kickashbasket #thermopro #carnivore #forkyeah #foodiegram #foodhunter #foodstagram #eeeeeats #eats #breakfast

Life gets a little better with smoked Gouda and cheddar. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ———————- I don’t know about you, but I absolutely love to cold smoke cheese. Here I have Gouda, white cheddar and yellow cheddar ready to to go super duper, low and slow in to the smoker. I’ll cold smoke my cheese with apple wood pellets smoking for about three hours.

Trimmed up my beef navel. Time for makin’ beef bacon. 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ➖➖➖➖➖ My 8 pound beef navel was a little thin, but I split it in two and completed the trim. Thanks to @jesspryles for giving me a few tips on trimming. Now on the cure!

Thanks to this beef navel, guess what makin’? Yep, beef bacon. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet 🥩🔥 You are probably thinking, uhhhh, are you off your rocker?  But seriously I’m not! But thanks to a recipe that I stumbled upon from @jesspryles, I dialed up a few local butchers and asked for a beef navel. Despite their laughs that cows don’t have belly buttons, I was able to get this wonderful 8 pound beef navel from @stpaulmeatshop. 🥩🔥 I’ll end up curing this glorious piece of meat for 3-5 days and then smoke it on up with some hickory wood. Then I’ll cool, slice and sizzle it in my cast iron pan. You may begin drooling now.

Can’t wait to smoke eggs in the shell for smoked deviled eggs! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ I know what you’re thinking, smoking eggs in the shell? Yah, right. Well to quote Rob Schnieder in nearly every great Adam Sandler film, “You can do it.” These white eggs got some great color on the inside and were perfectly hard boiled just through smoking. Even had a nice smoke ring. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ However, if you’d like more smoke, hard boil first on the stove, peel and then go into your smoker for a little bit. Then slice in half and take out the yolk and make deviled eggs. I cannot lie, give it a try. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ #smokedeggs #smoked #deviledeggs #bbq #barbecue #barbeque #kamadojoe #kamadojoenation #biggreenegg #biggreeneggnation #fogocharcoal #kickashbasket #zipkick #zipkickbloggers #pitmaster #mnfoodie #mplsfoodie #instafood #eeeeeats #eats #minnstagram #minnstagrammers #minnstagramers

The brisket from Q-Fanatic was fantastic! 🥩🔥 #thesmokypoet ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ If you’re in the Twin Cities and love BBQ like me, then you’ll want to check out Q-Fanatic.

Some like chicken, some like grilled fish. Either one is so delish. 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet • I definitely love preparing a spatchcock chicken. Flip over on to the breasts and staring at the thigh, take a kitchen shear and cut along both sides of the backbone. Then flip over and press on the collar bone to flatten. • But I also like to grill up salmon a the same time. Easy to do this with multiple grates in the divide and conquer system of the Kamado Joe. • #foodporn #foodspring #carnivore #carneforte #certifiedgrilllover #carne #kamadojoe #fogocharcoal #meatporn #fishporn #salmon #chickenporn #bbqlife #bbq🍖 #bbqseason #bbqlifestyle #delicious #bbqexperience #bbqnation

It’s Beef Ribs to start off National BBQ Month. Let’s get saucy! 🥩🔥#thesmokypoet • Sometimes if I’m lazy and don’t fire up the smoker, the pressure cooker works great. Then just sauce and throw under the broiler. • Otherwise, I’ll put on a great rub and go low and slow or often times rotisserie.
