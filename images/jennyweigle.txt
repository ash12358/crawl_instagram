Some of my favorites from the book of #poems titled “Salt” by @nayyirah.waheed. This book touched my ❤️ in such a profound way. It has inspired my writing. It brought me peace, joy, laughter, tears, discomfort...and all of that was wonderful and beautiful. And that’s what I love about #poetry ❣️ #nayyirahwaheed #saltpoems #inspiration #beauty #beautyinwords

Crazy that it was 9 years ago, over Memorial Day Weekend, that I moved out of Tampa and headed for Chicago. And here I go again...leaving Tampa after a two-week multi-city adventure that was full of friends, family, great clients, new experiences, workouts, singing, dancing, swimming, silliness, laughing (LOTS of laughing), and happy tears 😍. The good news is that my parents are moving back to Tampa, so I’ll be visiting a lot more! But for now, SoCal summer is calling my name. Till next time Tampa! 👋🏼. #family #tampa #love #blessed #silly #laugh #tampagirl

To say that I am proud of this woman...that’s a major understatement. I am IN AWE of my dear sister, @arw319. She completed 70.3 miles swimming, biking and running in today’s half Ironman race. And she did it with the sun, heat and humidity bearing down on Chattanooga. She did it with a smile on her face and determination in her soul. WHAT A BADASS. She makes me feel like I could do ANYTHING. I love you Mans. I’m lucky to have a sister who inspires me as deeply as you do. 💞 Congrats finisher!! 👊🏼 . . . #ironman #ironman703 #halfironman #seventypointthree #chattanooga #downtownchattanooga #noogastrong #ilovemysister #badass #swimbikerun

Prepping for the biggest presentation of my career next week and I’ve got all-the-feels. Psyched. Elated. Nervous. Busy. Wondrous. And yet incredibly grateful because I literally prayed for this opportunity, this job, two years ago 🙏🏼. How freakin lucky am I?! I mean, I get to geek out every day talking about building communities 🤓. I get to work in the fast-paced super-exhilarating world of tech while doing it. Hey Universe, you delivered 😉, and then some 👊🏼. Love to @buildinglithium 💙! ... #Repost @inspiringyou.co with @get_repost Isn’t this the truth?

#tbt to traveling to #SouthKorea exactly 12 years ago. This @rotaryinternational 30-day Group Study Exchange was the opportunity of a lifetime! I’ll never forget the kindness of the people, Rotarians, and our hosts. For some children, we were the first Westerners they had ever met in real life. What an honor! Grateful for my GSE teammates, great food experiences, night after night after night of karaoke, the natural beauty of South Korea, everyone throwing peace signs all the time, the chance to speak to a crowd of 40,000 people (in Korean!), learning how to sip #soju with every meal (out of respect for their culture), exposure to this beautiful culture, and yes...fried insects. Tasted like chips! 🙏🏼 #rotary #rotaryinternational #korea #throwbackthursday #travel #groupstudyexchange #rotarians #friedinsects #blessed #lifeisgood

Thank you thank you thank you all for your outpouring of love and messages yesterday! The big celebration was a surprise birthday party that @withlindseyrae and @cbench2 planned for me last weekend...complete with...oh come on you know it...karaoke! It was THE most perfect night!! Many thanks to all who came out for it and everyone who sent me bday wishes. BRING IT, 37! 👊🏼

A long time ago, I used to write poetry. A VERY long time ago. Something stirred within me during the last year to start writing it again, but in secret. Yet today I felt compelled to share this one I wrote in honor of @withlindseyrae and @cbench2. Because when two of the people who know you best throw a surprise bday party for you, these are the emotions that come to the surface. All at once. Hitting you HARD. And for someone who is still learning how to receive this level of love, support, and kindness in her life...well, it can be quite overwhelming (in many many good ways). Thank you Lindsey Rae and Caitlyn for seeing me, and for a truly fabulous lesson in receiving! 🙏🏼 (And for serenading me and indulging my insane passion for singing 😊). #poetry #poem #birthday #bday #friendship

@digitsnailbarlosangeles did it again!! I love that Annie makes my nails individual pieces of art ❤️❤️❤️. #nailart #santamonica  #Repost @digitsnailbarlosangeles with @repostapp ・・・ Let your self awareness be your best teacher. Be in tune with your feelings, reactions, attachments and most importantly- what makes you happy. Anything and everything that matters should compliment  who you are, if it doesnt- let that go. Let go of what doesn't serve you🙏- AnnieDigits I want to share a bit of background on each set of #custom #nailart that I do for my clients. To me, this is a #spiritual connection as I free my mind of anything thoughts so I can quiet my mind and listen to the #beautiful stories & experiences that are shared with me. And with this I am able to express each individual's  personality, style, stories, and what they're feeling  and give them their own #inquisitive #artshow 🌻 this makes me happy.

I'm THRILLED to announce that a new chapter of Spiritual Sisters has started in Miami! (Just search the group title in Facebook to find it.) This chapter will be led by @hamsainteriors my dear childhood friend @adriglusman. I started the first chapter of Spiritual Sisters in LA in July 2015 because I wanted to connect with more women who practiced spirituality, mindfulness, and personal development. And now the Miami group is the 5th chapter of this dynamic community! Wishing Ariela and Adrienne all the best as they lead this heart-centered group 😍! Hope I can come to one of their events one day! If you know anyone in Miami who'd be interested in joining, please do share this with them. 🙏  #Miami #southflorida #southFL #spiritual #spirituality #mindful #mindfulness #personaldev #personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #women #feminine #sisters #facebookgroup

I've been at a non-stop party the last 4 days! (AKA, Unleash The Power Within) At this party, I walked on fire, called bullshit on my limiting beliefs, created new KICKASS beliefs, danced almost the entire time, shook that ass, screamed so much that I've lost my voice, and unleashed my soul!!! And the best part was... @tonyrobbins didn't do that. I DID THAT.

Don't you love it when a movie moves you to your core?! I was hooked on #LaLaLand from the opening number (in the pic). I loved every part of it...the acting, the singing, the dancing, the script, the storyline, the costumes, the sets. I came here with a dream, much like many people who move to #LosAngeles. My dream didn't have to do with #Hollywood, but it was still MY dream. It was the biggest personal risk I've ever taken to follow my heart. And although it didn't turn out the way I thought it would, the film reminded me of all of the wonderful things that DID turn out that I had never planned for. Amazing that a film can do that for you, right?! "Here's to the fools that dream. Crazy as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that break. Here's to the mess we make." Grateful to the dreams and to the messes 🙏🏼. Thank you to everyone who had a part in creating @lalaland! Thank you for the beautiful story and for these exquisite reminders about what's important in life 💕.

Thank you thank you thank you! Thanks to #TeamEileen, we hit our fundraising goal tonight! This deep feeling of gratitude has had me smiling all week.

#tbt Exactly 2 years ago, I was on an incredible personal development journey in Bali, where I met my soul sisters, faced my fears, and changed my entire outlook on life. Grateful to @mastinkipp @dylanschmidt_ @satsiri for holding the space for all of us 2 years ago. My journey continues, and my life has been more fulfilled and blessed ever since Bali. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 #Bali #entertheheart #retreat #personaldevelopment #soulsisters

A little more than a year ago, Mom's life was forever changed after suffering a brain hemorrhage. But Dad's life was changed too as he needed to retire to become her full-time caregiver. Being a caregiver is exhausting on your physical, emotional and mental health. This is why our family is asking for your assistance to hire some help, not just for Mom's sake, but also for Dad's. Any amount you can give is GREATLY appreciated! Please click the link in my bio to donate. #TeamEileen #ComeOnEileen #FamilyIsEverything 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

It's my last day in #Florida. There's never enough time to see everyone I want to catch up with (and if you're one of the many I wasn't able to see, I'm so sorry). It's been one hell of a trip. There are days I think about coming back here. There are days when I think I'll never leave Santa Monica. No matter which kind of day I'm having, these visits to #Tampa always leave me feeling happy, sentimental, and extremely grateful. This town made me who I am today. My roots will always be here, and so will a piece of my ❤️. Until next time, Florida...whenever that may be.

Exactly one year ago today, Mom suffered a brain hemorrhage. Thank God that Dad called 911 in time to get her the medical attention she needed. Over the days that followed, her conditioned worsened. My siblings, father and I felt shock, sadness, confusion, disbelief, grief while we watched Mom hanging on for her life in the ICU. What was happening? Would she make it? Why was this happening to the kindest, gentlest soul we knew? Over the last year, Mom has endured multiple brain surgeries. She spent the 2015 holidays in the hospital and treatment center. She's had countless therapy appointments. Dad has become her full-time caregiver. Many many things have changed, but these changes brought our family closer than ever. Today, I'm proud to say that Mom is on a steady path of healing, and her doctor still expects her to make a full recovery! Her cognitive skills have come back strong. She's now able to stand up a few times a day on her own. She can walk short distances. There was a time when we didn't know if these things would ever happen again. Our family sends our deepest thanks to our friends and relatives for the love, prayers and support you have given during this last year. We know that your prayers definitely helped Mom get to the place she is today. We thank God for answering our prayers and bringing Mom back to us. On this day when our nation is so divided, I implore you to take time to tell a friend or relative that you love them, even if it's for no reason at all. We have no idea when we will take our last breath on this Earth. Our family celebrates EVERY DAY that Mom is still with us, and we share our joy and sincere thanks with all of you! ♡♡♡ #ComeOnEileen ~ Mark, Eileen, Jenny, Amanda, Adam, Erika

I don't know who originated this but I LOVE it and cannot focus today because the only thing on my mind is my former home of #Chicago and Game 7! Best #Cubs memory: sneaking into a game in 2005 with my cousin. The Cubs were down by 3 and came back to win it in the 9th! Did I mention that was also my very first Cubs game? You've got this #Cubbies! 🙌🏼 #gocubs #gocubbies #gocubsgo #gochicago #ilovechicago #joemaddonrocks #iluvchicago #ChicagoGirlLivingInLA

Last week, I hit my 💯th class at @basecampsm and officially joined the Century Club!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 This community has completely changed my life. I've never seen such immediate changes in my body. I've never pushed myself so hard physically (even marathon training doesn't compare to these classes). I've never been so motivated to get to a workout 5 days a week. And as a result, I'm down 2.5 jean sizes. I've made incredible friends. I've found instructors that inspire me every day (and on Instagram 👍🏼). I feel more energy now than the year I turned 30.  Oh, and I'm CRUSHING my fitness goals like never before and not stopping. Next goal: Achieve the 6-mile shirt. I WILL DO IT. And here's to 100 more classes! Thank you to my #Basecampfamily for the ongoing encouragement and support! #basecampsm

My mother is the strongest person I know. She is currently in yet another surgery. She's having a revision of her previous surgery, but a much milder form that's not as invasive. She's been though so much since November. I hope and pray this is the final procedure and that Mom can focus on her therapy and healing from this point on. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
