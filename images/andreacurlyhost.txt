Hanging out with the fam and teaching Den about LOL dolls. Happy Memorial weekend!

It was so inspiring being at Taliesin; a space that wasn't as refined or well-preserved as some of his other spaces. The beauty was in all the experiments and ideas that students implemented for him (sometimes poorly). It was a place where he tested things and changed the spaces as their needs changed. It was a space that forced you to keep looking out at the nature around you and feel inspired by it. Highly recommend people visit it. And then afterwards run through the House on the Rock for kicks and giggles.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/433107c351ee3c268f887eb5cd4c7b96/5BCDC1D2/t51.2885-15/e35/33473549_178581662975314_795087605715697664_n.jpg
The House on the Rock was a silly and overwhelmingly busy space. Ready to go home!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b30b60bf8f0ca2dfc13ae71de9f8d465/5BE1D590/t51.2885-15/e35/33532866_372534499917348_3876257900749914112_n.jpg
Frank Lloyd Wright's room was so modest and much of the articles were gifts from students. He didn't use his stained glass windows here so he could have a clear view of the nature around him.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/89de1f17bcfc50f7a9d2eb1797521ecb/5BE6017B/t51.2885-15/e35/32893439_583375098703934_1812481808139288576_n.jpg
Frank Lloyd Wright's choice in decorative materials consisted of a lot of Japanese art and furniture he didn't design.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/46cb42c68afe4ec3ec240cc333b76bf4/5BE2E7EF/t51.2885-15/e35/32255803_584987565190033_3552539786084352000_n.jpg
Starting to explore the inside of Taliesin. They said that it was an experiment and constantly changing.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4d9db786f3b89e60488385bb090623e9/5BD2D511/t51.2885-15/e35/33085108_1828249737484713_6418882083329933312_n.jpg
It was in the 90s and the mosquitoes were terrible... But it was really fun to explore the grounds around Taliesin to see where Frank Lloyd Wright spent time.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d5dccfa019ea65e554eb73f1fc8af53b/5BE1C454/t51.2885-15/e35/32550953_441876059569077_169717436587704320_n.jpg
These are the grounds and around Taliesin made up of an architectural school and performance hall.

Frank Lloyd Wrighting it up this weekend at his summer home, Taliesin. He was a man birthed at the end of the Civil War and passed at the beginning of the space age; a man before his time. Pictures to come.

When your cat surprises you from all of her hiding and decides to cuddle your guy only when you're away.

I've heard it said about parenting that the nights are long but the years are short. As an entrepreneur it seems like the days can go on forever and there will never be an end to work. Sometimes it takes a little lull to reflect on all the amazing things that working for yourself allows. So grateful to be doing the work I do.

So, in the spirit of Easter, I need to come clean about something. My hair is not curly. It is bone straight and has been for 20 years. Thus, I needed to change the name of my business. Check out www.straighthost.com.

Take away from the Sagmeister speech... anyone can make something that's functional. It's hard to make something beautiful. But those are the things that people remember. Not function, but Beauty.

My nephew Jack is slightly more impressed with Lexi than Lexi is of him. A cute tug of war ensued after this when Jack took Lexi's bone. Lexi was so gentle and patient trying to get it back.

We're at a thing where Dennis needs to trim his giant beard and stand like this.

And then after 11 days she just meandered back into our lives.

My Grandma Gene is 90! We're lucky to have such a spry and joyous lady. I vote we keep her around for another 10 years, at least!

Oh hey there winter, you're quite beautiful if I don't pay attention to your temperature.

Movie night sometimes gets delayed when the filmmakers decide to do some costuming exercises.

The fun of living with creatives is when you're just done they keep going.

She's a keeper. Very thankful we have neighbors who care.

When you find your kitty cat and you're more excited than she is.

The Sound of Music... Always uncomfortable to see a swastika.

Had a lot of fun with the Women in Tech tonight. Thanks Grand Circus for helping provide a space for honest conversation about things that matter.

Sometimes you realize you just don't need coworkers.

Bear (the cat on the table) is my cat from childhood... she's new to the household since Thanksgiving. John (cat on the ground) has been intensely interested in her. It's fun watching them figure out if they want to hang out because he wants to hang out with her WAY more than she wants to hang out with him.

Got to capture it perfectly! Melting Pot for the win.

I love it when Bear (the newer lady cat) and John (the homebody who is male) hang out with each other... It's slowly getting better.

Yikes... In my quest to attract cute animals in the back yard I also got a hawk munching on another bird. It's plucking out all the feathers one by one.

Sometimes working late includes Christmas music and putting plastic on windows... Good thing we've got the White Christmas album on. Phew!

You would think that in a user experience group everyone would bowl a perfect game... instead we had a great time and figured the world out through speaking... and Dennis... well, he was also having a lot of fun.
