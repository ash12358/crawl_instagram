Carefree ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ As an artist, I find it difficult to accept anything within my own creative control less than perfection, especially as I grow more aware of flaws I may have. Recently, I‚Äôve let that limit my ability to produce anything I feel is worth existing. Unfinished work is the byproduct, evidenced by posting less on here. But I am getting older, and perhaps part of doing so is choosing to let go, rather than hold onto. Until the day I meet my Maker, I will not reach the most ideal of situations. And that‚Äôs fine. My bedroom is disorganized most weeks and I wear my favorite shirt wrinkled most of the time, suggesting maybe ‚Äúperfectionism‚Äù means a little less than it sounds. I haven‚Äôt forgotten to write something today, though. My goodness, it‚Äôs encouraging to know I don‚Äôt have to obtain perfection for God to see it. Sometimes I have to settle down for a moment and realize these contraptions aren‚Äôt home. Grace is a treasure of a thing.

Release ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Firecrackers diffuse like distant conversations into a cloudy fever dream as the stars watch their reflections twinkle in a rising tide. Lift your arms as far as your hands might reach, for liberty is an open sky, my darling.

Midday ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A midday sun pours down a cloudless sky and weaves through scattered leaves to splotch the walls of old ornate hotels until life is breathed back in them for passersby to feel at home, if only for a moment.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c3bf79699ffad12bd112250ec1898a52/5BCFDFC6/t51.2885-15/e35/36148281_238463256946158_8695581909784199168_n.jpg
Cat Nap ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Family vacations to familiar places always bring about extraordinarily plain encounters like these. We saw this kitty resting on a shed near a busy seafood restaurant. He woke up to find a group of people staring at him, and he immediately fell back asleep. I wonder if he daydreams about mice.

Sentiments ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Photographs contain the reality of life by capturing not only the time-stuck moments therein but the complex sentiments in between. Inside a frame can be more than the snap of a finger, maybe something like that certain feeling you get walking into your childhood bedroom. Can there be found a visual for the unseen? I‚Äôd like to make the endeavor, in simple ways.

Flares ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Starry nights are the first thing I‚Äôd wish to steal with city eyes. But liquid lights start bursting, And dripping down these cloudy skies. While their twinkles all but vanish, I‚Äôm left with a picture on my mind. So before the flares all languish, I lift a jar to bottle them inside.

Quiescence ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ On a quiet corner, lost feet caper hardwood floors under overgrown arbors where empty laughter echoes like music; every passerby an unbeknownst witness to a ghost party.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/feb36573addaa3ea2f4158fe501547c3/5BCF6072/t51.2885-15/e35/33210294_220552758735973_1857431333836423168_n.jpg
Illumination ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Neon royalty eclipses the escapist mind, whose brightest notions remain undisclosed like bulbs of pure sunshine inside a papier-m√¢ch√© silhouette. It‚Äôs been said that secret beacons hide a treasure beheld only by eyes that see through faux radiance, and occasionally those who glimpsed a shooting star mid-conversation and felt they were crazy just trying to recall it. Pseudo star quality never dims quiet illumination.

Junebug ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ We depart from spring Where bellflowers ring, To a sunny June Where dandelions bloom, And we take such a risk Just to make such a wish.

Enclosure ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ An open field of surprises hides beyond commonplace civilized life, wherein lie secrets the world never cared to notice; the cluttered minds roam free while lost feet are found.

Forgotten Place ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The most forlorn home finds comfort where hearts reside, for to be known and discovered in a way unique to the individual soul is to contain purpose.

Interval ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Well-spent time teaches feet to dance, minds to ponder, and new things to fall slowly apart.

Concord ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Colors work in concord as they dance about the walls and sidewalks in weathered tinting and old paint. We‚Äôre given creative eyes to capture God‚Äôs hidden compositions among our own architectural strivings; a sunburst atop a lamppost, a rainbow inside a windowpane, a constellation in peppered concrete.

Expedition ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I have a deep fascination with fleeting forests and their varied towering trees of untethered thoughts. I often find myself lost even when I know exactly where I‚Äôm standing. Expeditions of this life have me wandering un-aimlessly with a map in my heart, stumbling serendipitously into the flowers and foliage of inspired dreams.

Rejoice ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My dear granddaddy is dancing with his wife now in the eternal presence of His Creator. I‚Äôll miss his gentle way and kind demeanor, but there is comfort in knowing he is rejoicing. A joy-ridden morning that lasts forever. My soul ever the more aches for this.

All That‚Äôs True ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve said before That a metaphor Can capture all that‚Äôs true: For the hour rings As the flower springs And suddenly God makes us new.

Thriving ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt just want to smell the flowers and watch their petals open. I want to be like them, to grow and to blossom and to absorb the sun. I want to be the flowers I always find myself dancing, smiling, and laughing in.

Silhouettes ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Skipping along flooded sidewalks till our reflections catch our eyes. I rather miss the silhouette with an umbrella to my left; she is puddling in waves now rather than waving at puddles.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/173c73245677e00317bfc1e763f3a0f0/5BCFD328/t51.2885-15/e35/29403026_437608173336441_8457909388970033152_n.jpg
Transposed ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The most inequitable exchange of all Renders our hearts transposed with His; Our crown of ashes on His head, His crown of beauty of our head; Our sinful hands washed white, His perfect face stained blood-red. Victory belongs to the defeated, And flowers grow from the dead.

Model Village ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Woven together with little Christmas lights, a sleepy world lies below. I feel helpless to the sky with all of its vastness, and I wonder if all the souls on solid ground feel helpless, too. Blue hour dawns at the peak of evening, and somewhere a hearth keeps frigid fingers warm. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Bell Mountain in Hiawassee.

Faraway ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Escape into that realm inside your mind where impossibilities rule. Let its secrets be the breeze beneath your weightless feet. Let its promises be the clouds that your head gets lost in. Close your eyes, and tiptoe on the mountaintops as they dance to and fro, for they are just as movable as your faith is strong. üì∏: @calebjoseph_

Clarity ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It becomes quite clear that a person whose purpose is to disprove something is simply in denial of its truth.

Another Planet ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I was staring through a five-layer window at the memories playing on the television I left behind. It felt so cold to be so distant from something so warm. Living on the moon means you dance in the moonlight both night and day. But it is all quite empty, this expanse, when there is nothing to place inside of it; no smile, no mention, no thought, no person. They told me to give her space, so I sent her a post card of the stars. We‚Äôre in a ballroom now.

Wading in Twilight ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A pool of afterglow clouds amass around your feet to have you wade in twilight shores. Finding forever in a fleeting moment. Inspiration floodgates break in teal and tangerine.

Soleil Fleur ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ In an efflorescent aubade, the sunbeams lyricize the aromas that make springtime sweet, while the birds tune their voices to just the right season; harmonious are the eclectic instruments that weave together the stanzas of this blossoming little poem.

A Great Unknown ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Magnolia spent her weekend following a forlorn path alongside a silver railway into a great unknown where flowers and Ferris wheels feel like friends we haven‚Äôt met yet, but then again, who is to say that a gracious familiarity lies on a trembling sunless horizon that turns the eventide dark.

Twenty One ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Growing up. I never wanted to admit that the spaceship in my backyard was an ordinary swing set. I never wanted to look in the mirror and see a hopeless romantic. I never wanted to turn the page if it meant the next chapter wasn‚Äôt fiction. Because, in fact, I thought that‚Äôs what growing up was. I thought it was disbelief shrouded in realism.

Another Day ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Coffee grounds and cocoa mounds Hide at the bottom of their mugs. Sunset ends and chilling winds Lock two dreamers in warm wool hugs. Gourmet meals and winter deals Accompany them in a getaway. Skyline hues and rooftop views, They save in photos for another day.

Last Phase ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ There is something strange about twilight, the way the sun leaves behind those traces of twisted colors, to shed enough light onto every soul‚Äôs face to make one wonder what other surprises lie between the shadows.

A New Year ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ For 2017, my creative resolution was to write a poem with twelve lines for every one of the twelve months as the year went by. It was a trying task near the middle, but I kept at it knowing the payoff would be valuable, and my girlfriend encouraged me to keep writing. I finished the project, by God‚Äôs grace, and all twelve poems are now available to read on my website. The title of the project is simply ‚ÄúTwelve: Poems of the Year.‚Äù I encourage you to check it out at the link in my profile. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ For 2018, my creative resolution is to continue my journey in portraying my visions through photography, not just on instagram but in every outlet; and to commit greater effort to writing. Such a proposition is easy to speak of, but far more difficult to follow through with, while still being in school and working a job as I am. But difficult is by no means impractical when your life is not your own. And my life is not my own. It belongs to God, and my greatest desire is to fully devote the talents He gave me to the tools I have to work with. With that being said, I‚Äôm planning to update my blog far more regularly with journal posts, as well as some fiction and poetry. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I also redesigned my website for the New Year, which you may notice when checking out my ‚ÄúTwelve‚Äù project. There are other creative plans on the shelf as well. I‚Äôve a camera, a pen, paper, and an imagination too big for my own mind. That‚Äôs enough to keep me creating. And the stars above my ceiling are enough to keep me inspired. Remember, friends, if you stay true to God, you are always staying true to yourself, for your Creator knows you best. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Portrait üì∏: @zthompii

Present Moments ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A few little present moments stolen from this treasure of a day. I‚Äôm welling with gratitude during this season to call kind folks with hearts after God friends and family. May He bless you each with peace, love, and truth, those sort of gifts that could only come from above. If you do not know Him, may I just say ‚Äî the offer of eternity is as simple as you could imagine, and a dirty manger throned the King of all. He must think you, human, are rather worth it all.

Last Gift ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Tomorrow (December 26th), I have a sneaky NEW 3-part photo series. Here is your hint: it has to do with the one-year anniversary of a project I began in 2016 about a mystery, romance, and darkness.

Window Wishes 1/2 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Snow only ever written about touches the heart but never the ground, like an unwrapped gift always sitting under the tree. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Part 2: @lunardeep

The True Spirit ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Pine needles stuck on the bottom of my socks, melodies stuck in my head, and peppermint pieces stuck between my teeth ‚Äî a little bit of everything but nothing without that wishful love and kindness that began with a baby. A soul truly does feel its worth, and the magic stays if it‚Äôs the true Spirit and not the feeling leading the way.

Last Leaf ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Autumn‚Äôs last breath Is a gust of wind That blows the last leaf left To its bitter end. A cascade of color Comes crashing down, And red and orange wonder Befall a colorless ground.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2ee4aa63647666a1e643ff9807e0348e/5BC93999/t51.2885-15/e35/24126984_686469361477082_1773841735428866048_n.jpg
Episode VIII ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs time to watch The Last Jedi with my stormtrooper. I will update you with my spoiler-free feelings about it in the coming days. May the Force be with you.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ec8178a58c6e742d3dda65aafab99053/5BCA66A3/t51.2885-15/e35/25009411_134669403913229_6324890868700413952_n.jpg
Surpassing ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Can you imagine what it is like to smile at the sky and know she is smiling back? We do it all the time. We drink syrup tears from weeping willows and make melodies with whistling winds. A cloud‚Äôs embrace and the sun‚Äôs invitation say we belong to something beyond what we know of the frost on our fingertips. There is a warmth and fog to the breath that goes with a familiar face. I can feel the forever everywhere. Surpassing is still passing, just with a flare of infinity. The world spins at the perfect speed for us to never keep up ‚Äî but oh, contentedly so.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8d8453cff6aa159fde01bf671f62d3e5/5BE215CF/t51.2885-15/e35/25007847_1939100543077527_5382420360710848512_n.jpg
December ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The last of my monthly poems this year: ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Frosty is the mint on the tip of our tongues, Like the snowflakes that softly land on us. We sing out a carol from the top of our lungs, One of freedom to live in God‚Äôs promise. Our window shields weather the morning ice, Which the rising sun is just enough to melt. Laughter is paired with Christmas lights, And our brightest hopes are known and felt. High spirits hang like colorful ornaments On the branch of every evergreen soul. The hearth inside says we‚Äôre more than meant For the the joy of a fire amid the cold. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs next?
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fc0a391f628aaea722acc75d82557e1b/5BCAFEF7/t51.2885-15/e35/24327688_719361321587756_5339986655057018880_n.jpg
Wonderment ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Joy is that wonderment which no leaf can outlast, no season can eclipse, and no happiness can reach, but which every one them touches at some point in the mountainous stretch of life.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0a741e4bcce02d8f5efb869f0251421/5BDC5BC4/t51.2885-15/e35/24175322_156739125081458_7894835152080076800_n.jpg
Distance ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Even if it‚Äôs behind the trees, there is always a greater beauty ahead. You must simply carry on with your journey remembering that.

Festive ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A certain darling of mine surprised me with a little Christmas-themed, cozy-ridden picnic, and my heart got those little fuzzies that you get when you‚Äôve been wearing a sweater too long. Do something festive and magical and special today.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3dea93e898221bd8e7e66215f5de9ed8/5BC8DFD5/t51.2885-15/e35/23969712_289186701590441_6783941916804251648_n.jpg
Swept Up ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúRejoice always, pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks.‚Äù May you find yourself in evermore joy, prayer, and thanksgiving, for to do so is to live in the light of Christ, swept up in the gusts of grace.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f5ab9c848a98a5e84dcfa177ec729b6b/5BD5D659/t51.2885-15/e35/23824412_1487249161362747_7606541115923103744_n.jpg
Nine Seconds ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The light is off in the living room of his heart, but the lamp is switched on and there‚Äôs a dull glow under the hearth where the fire is dwindling. Just a sunset is enough to spark it. He tightens the scarf around his neck. Jackets scrape his arms as strangers pass him by. The leaves keep falling on his shoulders and the wind keeps pressing against his cheeks. He spends every moment of that precious time pondering the moments before and the moments to come, nine seconds.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7518d21765409f3720720fbee918e81c/5BDF49ED/t51.2885-15/e35/23733982_1725340044152692_4836332534792978432_n.jpg
Purified ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSince you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart, having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever, because ‚ÄòAll flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away, but the word of the LORD endures forever.‚Äô Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.‚Äù I Peter 1:22-25

Neon ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The alleyway is our ballroom and the stars are our tunes. I want to be friends with neon lights in a fluorescent reverie where we twirl the night away until we‚Äôre dizzy and overdosed on quiet candied autumn air, for there is a special sweet taste that only serendipitous campfire embers and Ferris wheel winds can meet you with, and all the restaurants sigh just to make you wish you were inside.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/738cc9c94e8c3cd49ce06c9e1739c6a8/5BD41185/t51.2885-15/e35/23347920_525633744455503_8519651558189694976_n.jpg
Of Flowers ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Loey Hudson, you darling. You are uncompromisingly sweet and impossibly beautiful. You fill the room with laughter and the sky with moonlight. I pray the last one of your teenage years keeps you growing in the Lord and growing always more amazed. He crafted a unique and special soul nineteen years ago. To the girl whose heart is made of flowers, happiest birthday.

November ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Diverse is the ballet of wispy leaves, Each one colored in unique grandeur. Nature holds gifts that the wind retrieves, And the afternoon scent smells so familiar. A doe and her fawn come out to play, Breathing out vapor in the morning light. Shopping bags and empty cares float away, Into the endless reach of the open night. Families gather around to give thanks, Wearing the coziest caramel sweaters. With turkey and too much on our plates, Life is fullest when we‚Äôre together.

Excerpt ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ In the peak of harvest, every mountaintop and valley is a new chapter, and every leaf and breeze is a new page. The words on the paper spell colors we haven‚Äôt dared dream.

Soda Pop (Bygone III) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ She is blissfully unaware And lives without a care, And time seems to stop As she sips her soda pop, For to her life is a song, And her worries are bygone.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fb06f4bf232d65b0847b10645e5fb4bd/5BD38AD5/t51.2885-15/e35/22500631_139622810007647_6437832488357199872_n.jpg
Snapshot (Bygone II) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ She steals a snapshot in time, Moments for her to rewind, And record players seem to say That she‚Äôs stuck in a single day, The day that the world forgot, But she‚Äôd rather be here than not.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d4502a3aeb145aba433b9483753578b9/5BE4A0D3/t51.2885-15/e35/22429794_120770672013242_6959781511444824064_n.jpg
Florist (Bygone I) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ She is in a backwards dream, Made of red and cream, And the florist brings her flowers From yesteryear‚Äôs hours, And the city quietly yawns As the night slowly dawns.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e81c855a26d8ebc45841c0f6e250029c/5BD9D1E3/t51.2885-15/e35/22429912_181828639030824_8863735179412242432_n.jpg
Relinquish ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Your greenhouses Are not so green And things that spring Must eventually fall.

October ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Amber is the sky on windy eves, For the twilight bleeds wine and rust. Its colors splash over the leaves, As they sway in the titian dusk. A harvest moon crops up ripe and full, Shedding warmth into every soul. We wear our cozy cotton and wool, To pick apples by the swimming hole. Goosebumps make all the heads turn, But not from the chill in the air. There‚Äôs a spook in every jack-o‚Äô-lantern And the moon-eyed owls are all too aware.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0bf0c792525ca5b4e53eb1309c0a5284/5BD5A20C/t51.2885-15/e35/22278201_1967577813513412_3506767159969710080_n.jpg
Samwise ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Today the sun is just as unyielding in its rays as the birds are in their tunes, but the breeze accompanies them both gently. This is Samwise, my brave ‚Äúhobbit plant‚Äù who resides contentedly in a tin mug, soaking in both rays and tunes.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4594203f469008cde902f5f29d0a3a2f/5BC99A1D/t51.2885-15/e35/21984781_130893574226098_8995778584513609728_n.jpg
Color Processing ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 35mm dreams and wishes for older things, to tiptoe into the past and roll it all back like dusty film, you develop into the person you were always meant to be, vibrant and warm.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ed9fb325ab125a619fc8f05905c3bc67/5BC8F998/t51.2885-15/e35/21911179_1985628035051497_5269864828549201920_n.jpg

Deciduous ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Take leave on the wind, And listen to the sound. Take flight and descend, And fall to the ground.

Pass√© ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It is not wise to idealize the past of course, but it‚Äôs even more foolish not to glean its sparks. I hearken back on the days of old because they have something to tell us. Sometimes I wish I were born earlier, but now I know I wasn‚Äôt because of the classic spirit I must impart to this brave new world which spins faster than I can compose on this forgotten typewriter. She is a lantern of timeless beauty in a generation stumbling in the dark wondering what beauty is. ‚ÄúSeek ye first the Kingdom,‚Äù He said. They call us old-fashioned, but we were just listening to future advice from the voices of the past.

Moonbeams ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Cosmic dust showers your cheeks, Bursting nebulas dance in your eyes, And you smile one of those stellar smiles, While the moon beams back at you.

Dwelling ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Over the hill was a corner they tried to call home, but the windows were cracked and the wind always came in. It was cozy but it crumbled to the ground. They figured walls could not contain the feverish hiraeth. A welcome mat never covered enough of heaven anyway, and the wanderer touched the moon into oblivion.

Obscuring ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Eclipsed light speckles are among the most surreal little wonders I‚Äôve captured with my two eyes.

Fenestra ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A sunny afternoon stifles chilled air as wisps of honey-painted leaves collect in cold resistance, resulting in an all-out burst of hostile intermediary beauty unwilling to compromise until the full moon says harvest is here.

Black Mountain ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A getaway weekend filled with friends and serendipity and accompanied by colder breezes and surrounding mountains, it left with me with a smile and photographs. My God is altogether beautiful. Check out my story to see some of the moments from the trip.

Solid Ground ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The disciples came to Him and asked, ‚ÄúDo you realize you offended the Pharisees by what you just said?‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚ÄúEvery plant not planted by My Heavenly Father will be uprooted, so ignore them. They are blind guides leading the blind, and if one blind person guides another, they will both fall into a ditch.‚Äù Matthew 15:12-14 (NLT)

September ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Hush is the descent of the first heavy leaf, As it lands on your lifeless balcony. The touch of citrine is a lovely motif In every vein of verdant anatomy. There‚Äôs something old ‚Äî a fall in your step, As the night ages slowly in twilight grandeur. It hides a silent mystery that‚Äôs very well kept, Until the rising day star begs to endure. Afternoons are spent in a warm luster, Where our every footstep is giddy. Stars align in a constellating cluster, And a breeze whistles in a cool ditty.

Duality ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Each leaf adjoining another in arranged artistic detail, he waves in the breeze that subtly creeps past the wooden bars which cast parallel shadows on his face to remind him that he is not alone.

Terrance ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Somedays you have to stop and smell the roses. Other days you have to stop and have a conversation with a turtle who‚Äôs on a tight schedule and late for a meeting but still willing to have a sip of coffee and discuss the wonders of life with you.

Driftwood Dreams ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve found that to be with Jesus is to be like Him. You can‚Äôt bask in radiant grace without glowing a bit yourself. Just as the ocean waves splash water on your feet, and the fireside brings warmth to your arms, He brings the same kind of love to you that He Himself is defined by. Search Him, and you may very well stumble upon yourself ‚Äî a character you never quite realized was written in His image. üì∏: @calebjoseph_

Next Chapter ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My cousin and close companion growing up married his dream girl today. I‚Äôm sad I couldn‚Äôt be there, but I‚Äôm elated for these two and their spectacular adventure ahead. Love is a bright and beautiful thing for which we were created. May Christ ever remain the centerpiece. ‚ÄúMany waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it. If a man tried to buy love with all his wealth, his offer would be utterly scorned.‚Äù Song of Solomon 8:7

Superfluous ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ We want memories from tomorrow. We want forever in a day. We want to chase our dreams wide awake. We want to fill our evenings with sunsets that never fade or flare. We want to stuff our pockets with wildflowers that never wilt or wither. And yet, the most of us fear what it means to give it all up for life at its truest.

Heart Soil ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A serendipitous thing is a search for hope, and only from heart soil does it spring. A thousand other sides later, and the deepest green she found sprouted out of her own mouth.

Savoring a Sunrise ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôve never tasted Paled turquoise confectionery clouds On a bronze butterscotch beach With aureate fairy-floss shores, Then you‚Äôve spared yourself from crystal cavities With sugar sand between your teeth, But missed out on the candy-cotton-wool dream Of savoring a sunrise.

August ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Humid is the air regardless of the sun, And everything is bathed in lavish heat. A looming shadow follows everyone, And a mirage hovers over the street. Textbooks are collected in pristine bags, While friends meet together once more. The tide retreats after waves collapse, And a gust of wind sweeps you off the floor. A missable moment holds a solar eclipse, And a dark sky shines with meteor showers. Snow cones give us syrup-stained lips, And we treasure the last of vibrant flowers.

Meditation ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúHe looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. May my meditation be sweet to Him; I will be glad in the Lord.‚Äù Psalm 104:32-34

Trothplight ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Two stargazers constellate Like countryside skies, Betrothed in golden moonlight, Where a joyous future lies.

Rarity ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Little shelf treasures at antique shoppes are the candy in the window to my inner kid. I inherited my Papa‚Äôs sentimentality; the records in his attic and the photographs on my hard drive get along rather famously. I‚Äôll bet the value of this lantern exceeds its tag. Maybe it even led a wandering girl home on a wintry night.

Recollection ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Over the last ten or so months, I‚Äôve carried my film camera with me to capture moments and ideas. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I got the rolls developed. This is a glimpse into the memories I‚Äôve made over the past year through analogue photography. #35mm

Woolgathering ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Sometimes I wonder, not from a doubtful heart, but out of a curious spirit. A night sky looks so picture-pretty but perfectly unexplored like poppies painted in summertime shades. And perhaps I‚Äôm spinning through a field of wilting wildflowers, and it‚Äôs only matter of hours before I‚Äôm awake again. I miss the way the lively breeze felt before the sneaky sunbeams danced atop your forehead. Maybe I‚Äôm woolgathering, but there‚Äôs something pure about it all. Everything is so broken, but I am so amazed, because this fragmented beauty keeps telling me I‚Äôm not home yet.

Ninety ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My granddaddy has lived ninety years now, and that means he carries with him a lifetime of experience actually living, and it truly shows. He may forget things rather frequently and put his foot in his mouth on occasion, but his confident and clever spirit remains an integral part of his personality, and he is old enough not to be afraid of acting young again. And he has always been acting, in some way. Most of his life was spent in theater alongside his wife ‚Äî the two of them, artists portraying all sorts of characters. Anyway, today I was asked what my favorite memory of him is. My very first thoughts were of silly stories denoting things he‚Äôs done or said that have been humorous to me, intentionally or otherwise. But then I remembered something quite special. When I was little, I watched him play the wingless angel Clarence in the stage show for ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life,‚Äù my favorite film. I should have been too young to recall this, but everything about that night was magical. I watched him perform in his last play and saw his talent for the very first time. He began to forget his lines after that, and so he moved on to the next stage of life. Perhaps he can‚Äôt play a perfect Clarence anymore, but he constantly reminds all the people around him, who have not lived as long as he, that it is a wonderful life indeed.

Stormless ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúFor the Lord your God is living among you. He is a mighty savior. He will take delight in you with gladness. With his love, he will calm all your fears. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.‚Äù Zephaniah 3:17

Calmed ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ What is freedom? Is it a prisoner who‚Äôs finally made his escape? Is it a deaf man hearing for the first time ever? Perhaps it‚Äôs not that simple. Perhaps freedom is security and liberty wrapped up together like unlikely friends ‚Äî but how entirely opposite that is of this collective construct we‚Äôve contrived from fleeting observations about a broken world. These are merry days and joyous nights for a man whose loyalty lies above and a woman who laughs with courage for future days. They are never let down in this life, because their hopes remain where disappointment cannot reach. And in the end, their responsibility is simply a byproduct of love. A cross is not a burden, for the weight of glory is the lightest yoke when a wandering soul is calmed by the realization that it has a home where moth and rust hold not the slightest threat.

Resolve ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Discomfort is the door through which we find peace, And blindness is the bridge to gaining new sight, For faith must be about what the eye never sees, Because just beyond our fears is a place called life.

All Dressed Up ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs something about lyrics written in the 1940‚Äôs that is so pure. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all dressed up to go dreaming, Now don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm wrong.

Sun Dust ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Caught in the vim of a firefly night that hasn‚Äôt lost its starry magic, you tiptoe into a dreamy dawn to await the daylight treasures scattered in secret places. Just beyond the windswept dark chocolate forest, auroral sun dust is sprinkled on a shore whose surface boasts pale turquoise and salted caramel. All a promise that you‚Äôre a lively creature meant for the giddy hope of being wide awake.

July ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Warm is the presence of scattered sun drops, Kissing our faces in the open blue. Tourists visit the beachside gift shoppes, Walking down the pier for an ocean view. Some days the heat feels like an old friend, And other days your driveway is a toaster. Seashells hide wondrous secrets within, Like the memory of the tide growing closer. Sailors escape their southern harbors, And make for the islands unexplored. Seagulls follow them in rapid departure, Off to see surprises of a brave new world. The Fourth arrives in patriotic displays, With freedom to offer our longing hearts. Our eyes are set alight like sunset waves, And the skies are decorated in sparks.

Or shall the thing formed say of him who formed it, ‚ÄòHe has no understanding‚Äô?‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Isaiah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠29:16 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Our most foolish assumption was that the Poet had no connection to His own poetry, for to think so is to believe we aren‚Äôt poetry at all. I can‚Äôt look at a flower or a fern or a succulent without being reminded of its complex detail, detail that I could only admire but never truly comprehend because, quite frankly, the beauty of nature is so far beyond me. Why, then, would I look to the stars in contempt as though the Man who sewed my eternally purposed soul into the depths of my intricately knit character, and ask if He knows my person only as well as those around me do. Don‚Äôt regard your Creator as you do creation. He sees into who you most positively are. People will compliment you, misinterpret you, sympathize with you, reject you, and even acquaint themselves with your innermost self; but He will always comprehend you in the deepest possible way, and not even you will know yourself a fraction as well as He.

Capturer ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A photograph has the means to tell a story. And its narrative is entirely dependent on the perspective of its capturer. Is the mountain a symbol of limitation, or a reminder of strength? Is the rose an image of vanity, or a sign of affection? Perhaps these questions are answered by the stories within the frames we capture every day. I never wish to take for granted the eternal weight of a moment, and all that it is meant to say.

Lift Off ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My head was in the clouds when she opened her wings again for her feathers to weave through the sand-ridden wind as a seamstress sews a needle through thread. And I smiled because both of us knew how to fly.

Balconies ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ An array of unassuming windows, each the same, but holding different bygone stories, neighbor balconies where onlookers stand to peruse the quaint mysteries of the city heights. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ If you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, I put together a video journal documenting a walk through Charleston. http://youtu.be/jr2geBpk6Jk

Longest Day ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Drops of pinnacled sunshine Set everything alight With their midsummer dream, Into a sky like clementine Composed of a late night Where stars wait to be seen.

Thriving ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ One day you‚Äôll find your windows crooked, your walls cracked, your floors missing boards, and your furniture entirely disheveled; and where then will your hope be? If your foundation is in fertile ground, then you can be sure that the ivy will cling to your door frame and the flowers will shoot through your roof, and they will be reminders that you are more than a house ‚Äî you are a home. Thriving is the heart that is overgrown when bones wither.

Father ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ To the man from whom I inherited my creativity, my introversion, half my sense of humor, and my knack for using a camera: Thank you for directing this child onto the right path for twenty years. It was in the moments that I witnessed your wisdom about life, your respect for others, and your love for my mother that I learned what it is to be a man after God‚Äôs own heart. One day I will raise a family that honors the Lord because of you. My hair is now longer than yours was in the eighties. I‚Äôm just saying. Thanks for chasing your passions and inspiring me to do the same. I love you, Daddy.

Boulevards ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I have a new video journal ‚Äî or perhaps more accurately an old one that was never finished ‚Äî that documents a quick day trip to Downtown Charleston back in February.

Climbing ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Slowly vining, The future is climbing, Never unwinding, Always in good timing: Silver lining, It‚Äôs ever deciding, Even defining, How we are abiding.

Identity ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ When you forget about figuring out who you are, and instead seek to know who God is, you‚Äôll find a very unexpected thing happens‚Äî you‚Äôll begin to know who you are just as well.

Hindsight ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ One day they will find themselves dancing in an era unfamiliar to them, and every mirror will be a photo frame for a memory not yet lived. Her eyes will tell a story and his smile will sing a song, like there‚Äôs a decade in every passing second.

Expectantly ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe eyes of all look expectantly to You, And You give them their food in due season. You open Your hand And satisfy the desire of every living thing.‚Äù Psalm 145:15-16 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Our hopes, our dreams, our wishes, our pursuits, our deepest yearnings are all found in You, and this world‚Äôs solutions to our expectations pale in the light of joy everlasting. üì∏: @zthompii

Fantastical ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Children wish for fantastical things. Adolescents wish for rational things. Grownups wish they had kept on wishing for fantastical things rather than rational things.

Historic ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Time never allows nostalgia to dissolve; it only ever deepens it. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Check out my second account @lunardeep for retro black and white 5x4‚Äôs. I‚Äôll be posting more regularly there.

Third Act ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ After the show Of daylight‚Äôs glow, The audience gasps with a pause. The curtains fall, The sun bows, And the thunder claps in applause.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4173bbb6a7f55865aa566b62ac532e90/5BDD263C/t51.2885-15/e35/18809689_1898079530481649_3421668353004011520_n.jpg
June ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Welcome is the appearance of fireflies at dusk, Until daylight peeks through with dandelion wishes. A greenhouse is painted with an olive brush, Where wedding bells chime for the mister and missus. Among the vibrant ballroom of Transvaal daisies, Butterflies are found dancing to the ditty of the wind. Neighborhood children sell lemonade and pastries, Only to buy ice cream when the truck comes back again. Fathers are honored by all sons and daughters, And soon our dog days arrive rather formally. We await the tide as it returns in clear waters, But never on chilly nights, at least not as normally.

An Isle ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ They look out and see an isle, But I think I see a man, A man who forgot to be a child, To be a part of land. They look out and see the water, But I think I see humanity, Taking this man from his Father, From his adopted family. They look out and see an isle, And most days I see it too, But every once in a while, I see a story written in the blue.

Time-Tested ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ An old soul will spend an hour watching a clock tick that never told the time for her, ride a bike through an unexplored town and call it home, smile at strangers knowing they‚Äôre people written somewhere in her book, and reflect on memories she never had because she knows how the future went for her and it went rather wondrously.

Meanders ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Do you ever take off just to see where you‚Äôll find yourself? Evenings spent under pale navy skies make for deeper dreams. One of my favorite things about summer is the whir the fan makes that lulls me to sleep on the nights when the heat wants to keep me up. We count our blessings instead of sheep because God has given us more than the wool wrapped around us. A peek into heaven is simply an open eye. We can see from where every good gift comes if we remember what He looks like. It was the lovely, proper, honorable things that crossed our minds when we had Him right there with us. A junebug slowly awakens in iridescent awe.

Mother ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My mother is a meek and tender soul with so much joy, wisdom, and laughter to share with every person she meets ‚Äî and every person will tell you so. Unlike me, she is very extroverted and outgoing, sometimes embarrassingly so, goodness. She has encouraged even my most fantastical dreams, with a healthy bit of rationality albeit, teaching me not to wander too far into the stars without a spacesuit. She carries God‚Äôs Word with her like spring flowers that never wilt come winter. Through her I have come to better know the affections that Christ has for me. I love you, Mom!

Standstill ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Pause for quiescence, Lest you are caught inside the loudness. Breathe for percipience, And let not your heart be remiss. Stand for resistance, Lest you are swept into the sea mist. Smile for consistence, And let not the sun be dismissed.

Commonplace ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ We find ourselves exploring the town for new perspectives on old treasures and warm shadows to glean from in between the sunshine patches.

Canicule ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Summer, I confess I saw you coming from months away. Take your time though, truly. I‚Äôm not quite ready for your spark to vanquish the scent of fully grown roses I‚Äôve found serendipitously on this walk through the seasons called life. I will welcome you back soon. I daresay your sunshine is most inviting.

Allegiance ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I am but a stranger and a pilgrim in this heaven-worshiping sphere of passing wonders bereft of true divinity. ‚Äî Read Hebrews 11:13.

May ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Tuneful is the song of the birds every morning, For they rhyme like rivers in a vibrant valley. Fully grown roses are greenery-adorning, And they fancy the whispering wind so madly. The sky graduates as gently as the weather, With new colors to add to its ever-growing pallet. Children and their mothers spend time together, And the sun plays the black and white clouds in a ballad. A memorial is made in the thoughts of every house, As a moment to be thankful for the utmost sacrifice. Twilight grows quiet with the chatter of a mouse, The only noise to permeate these warmer nights.

Lyrids ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Red blossoming flowers, And meteor showers. Firelight inside her eyes, Nights that sympathize. A mantel above the heart, A chimney for warmth's depart.

Moonset ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ When you pulled the covers around you, the moonrise collided with the brilliant evening. The stars bent down and whispered, ‚ÄúYou must be dreaming.‚Äù As you waved goodbye, the night returned to kiss you gently. The starlit nightfall brightened your surroundings. You could hear the wind breathing as it pulled through the atmosphere, tickling your neck; it was a healthy, chilling breeze that you tasted as you found yourself shivering violently. The moonset softly glided as the remaining night sifted down into the sewer cracks with the filthy daytime water. The sunbeams poured backwards to the top of the sky, raining lightness everywhere around. I wish I could say this went through my mind every morning. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ One of my first inspired writings, from February 28, 2012.

Each Day ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ To the nines, we‚Äôre dressed All up in our Sunday best; Spring fills our backyard views With reds, yellows, and blues. But little have we guessed‚Äî If He makes everything blessed, Then each day must be good news, And we simply have to choose. ÂçÅ

Possible Somethings ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Silence gives us headaches when there's nothing to fill it with, but as time moves on and the memories layer upon themselves, old things become more valuable, and so does silence as it ages every second and renders the moments it has collected in form of thought and sentiment. Its traces are left in all of us and we cherish it so. Silence is a friend you acquire after being with him long enough to know him. He holds a great deal of uncertainty, and that is beautiful. His second name is hope, and he is just as real as we make up our minds and hearts to believe, which is indeed very real. He makes up for his nothings with a world of possible somethings.

Familiarity ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I left a match in a mansion full of memories, and somehow the door is intact. Vines grow around the rotting walls and shoot blossoms into the dust-laden air, and the light causes the shadows to dissipate and warms the cold feeling of desolation. You can never forget. You just have to remember that every tomb you buried empty desperation in is fertile ground for perfect hope.

Kindness ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I long deeply to know kindness, as a bird knows his song, spreading it the whole day long, and not for a moment forgetting how.

April 7, 1978 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Her floral mind sings As she sleeps with sweet dreams. Tucked inside the petals, In her flowerbed she settles. It is April 7, 1978. Her heart springs and not a day too late. ‚Äî Music for listening: 1/1 - Brian Eno

Oasis ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Sometimes all you have to do to know your heart is home is to look up and see a familiar silver moon. Every once in a while in this art of a life, eternity shows itself in that torn crescent in the paper mach√© sky and that is one of His endless ways of lavishing peace upon the soul of His child who aches for heaven.

Conversation ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Time is strange. Memories that never happened remind us they were never meant to be. We see shattered moments when we allow ourselves to imagine how an occurrence might have gone. Eventually it becomes clear that God makes things better than we could have ever conceived in our own little minds.

April ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Fresh is the aroma that touches the air, For every flower in the field smiles and agrees. Petals parade through the sky everywhere, Flooding our vistas with a lively peace. Easter is delivered in form of a letter, On the morn of newness and grace. From the bleeding heart comes a sweet nectar For honeybees and hummingbirds to taste. This is the quintessence of being alive, Save for the pollen stains across every wall. Sunbeams descend so that we can thrive, And the First makes fools of us all.

Wisteria ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Oh my dear, A mysterious and wistful pretty; So sincere, A wisteria leaves one giddy. Petals open, Into the night her heart grows. Her bite potent, She makes one dizzy where she goes. Counterclockwise, She constricts, a tightened rope. With her eyes, She proves our dreams are heliotrope.

Observance ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Moment by moment, we change, and life is broken down and rebuilt around us, brick by brick, our hearts growing softer or more calloused, all while reality proves to have no limitations. We walk through the vastness of this wonder monotonously and hope for a surprise, as the sky nimbly changes color just above our heads; and every flower deftly blossoms and brings the honeybees; and the ocean tide slowly drifts away and leaves a thousand treasures in its departure. Oh, if the world turned upside down, would only astronomers notice?

Passmore ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met someone so bold and fearless, almost to a fault. Drew Passmore was a dear friend to many, especially my brother Caleb, and his passion for prayer spread as infectiously as his laugh this week while thousands upon thousands of individuals from everywhere united to pray in the wake of the accident he was involved in. At a sleepover party Caleb had when we were much younger, Drew happened to nod off first, so we used dry-erase markers to give him tattoos, as he naturally would have done to any one of us. He thought it was hilarious when he woke up, but his parents were not so pleased since we all had church in the morning. However, today as we recalled this memory, his dad said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I want you to remember him, those fun moments. He‚Äôs laughing up there now.‚Äù His work is finished. He was confident in belief, a good and faithful servant of God. All these people, many finally seeing heaven on earth, some no doubt kneeling before our Father for the first time, are evidence of that. Drew Passmore has come home to Jesus at last; and that smile ‚Äî that smile that meant the happiest of times and the most mischievous of pranks ‚Äî is something we can all look forward to. #BattleHard11

Guidance ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet mercy lead, Let love be the strength in your legs. And in every footprint that you leave, There'll be a drop of grace. If we can reach Beyond the wisdom of this age Into the foolishness of God, That foolishness will save Those who believe. Although their foolish hearts may break, They will find peace, And I'll meet you in that place‚Äî Let mercy lead.‚Äù ‚ÄîRich Mullins

Bicycle Shoppe ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs the glimpses of such quaint stores on street corners that also exist in the small town in sentimental minds that keep a person wondering what kind of nostalgia he‚Äôll see next out of the corner of his eye.

Rungs ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A fire escape is of little use when there is fire devouring the ground too. Luciferous reflections touched the glass when I turned around and saw it blazing forth. I pushed the door open hastily, and took the ladder as quickly as I could, missing a few rungs, which is likely why I felt so uneasy. My feet finally hit the ashes and they were cold. I looked up. It was a deep azure day with company from bluebird passersby. I have found I have a rare set of eyes. They see flames where sparks haven‚Äôt speckled the air in a fortnight. They see firecrackers in open nights where smoke hasn‚Äôt touched the atmosphere in months. They see shadows where not a mouse has stepped foot in years. So few do. I‚Äôll see the past again tomorrow but I‚Äôll try not to forget a rung, that I may take with me a security I can remember. Sundays feel like starting over, or something. There are easier thoughts to consider whilst gazing up a fire escape in an alleyway.

Droplets ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ A little bit of efflorescent beauty peeking out after a slow rainfall gives the heart a healthy prescription of light.

Market ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Days spent gazing at trinkets to buy, Like a hat or a painting or everything. Life is but the samples of food we‚Äôre scared to try, And us stopping to ask what such days mean.

Budding ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Just as the first flowers open their petals, so the day opens with beauty, its fragrance spreading further with each hour until it falls upon the eve, drifting down into a deep sleep until it is reawakened by the sun.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e630c3c286faf9679f2a0d716566319f/5BDE2C7B/t51.2885-15/e35/17075790_260236044427989_1693825511156875264_n.jpg
Speckles ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Warm like the radiance of a new day His love invites me into a moment. I smile knowing how that feels, and I cling to the memory of it, because whether my heart cries or sighs, it dwells secure. I am taken care of even in the seconds that the clouds seem to conceal the very thing keeping them visible.

March ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Green is the grass at the vernal equinox, A wonder that comes after every great cold. An hour is stolen from the solicitous clocks, And this day, like poinsettias, grows quickly old. There‚Äôs something new‚Äî a spring in your step, As you dance through clovers in the last light, Reveling in the land His hands crafted and kept, While forest colors prove pleasant to the sight. Talk of flowers and such emerge day to day, As wind chills and sunlight suddenly come together, Young verdure crops up in a lovely array, And, finally, this state starts to decide on its weather.

Clockwork ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ We like to think of time as stretching and jumping and halting and skipping. But time, much like the moon, does not change its course. It does not give to us or take away from us anything which we didn‚Äôt already expect it to, from our fundamental understanding of it‚Äî that it grows at a consistent rate, and never does anything else. Our circumstances make us think time moves differently on occasion; but time itself is not an occasional thing, occasional things are something within time. That we just happened to miss the moon at its fullest is not the moon‚Äôs fault. We always knew he‚Äôd shrink tomorrow. Clockwork is interesting. I imagine to angels it‚Äôs an entertaining thing seeing us miss the point of these temporal moments altogether. Time can be our starkest enemy or our fondest friend. What do you think He created it for? Not for wasting, I can promise.

Inward Light ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Imagine a city asleep, like a forest on a dry night, suddenly set alight with the flames of a single spark. These little flickers are ruptures in the darkness where the glow of eternity bursts through just moderately enough for a fool to think they‚Äôre extinguishable.

Cisco the Saint ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Slow-moving clocks Feel like old worn socks, Dragging each foot or hand On paper made of sand, And with every passing tick Comes a footstep in the nick Of time you had but forgot As you turned back the clock, Three hours on the dot, Not a moment too late For Cisco the Saint.

Catharsis ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Photography is, for me, a doorway to stories, which I love to tell‚Äî for stories are often the most significant way of communicating ideas. Photography allows me to express a level of creativity that is, in part, dependent on stealing moments that the world will never experience again, and then manipulating those photographs to highlight the qualities that I adore most, and even sometimes adding a touch of surreality to bring character and uniqueness to the story in which I‚Äôm meaning to tell. I like to think that all of my photos, as well as writings, exist in the same world, and that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a thread of mystery, wonder, and curiosity woven through each. This begs the question ‚Äî why do I need stories? Frankly, because it‚Äôs one of the most effective ways of coping with this influx of ideas in my head, which I believe are God-given, so I thank Him for catharsis.

Veneration ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I choose not to be crippled, not to let my worries overwhelm me, not to wither when the weather is not on my side, but to stand. I fear a God who doesn‚Äôt allow me to fear anything else. My enemies tremble with unsteady breath. My knees hit the cold ground. My heart palpitates when I hear His voice, a voice that calmed raging seas and turned a nation against itself. They ask how God‚Äôs goodness and power could coexist. Oh, but I, this insignificant little body in an endless universe, this soul whose worth outweighs the stars, am living proof. There is no glory without love, and there is no grace without awe.

Illusory ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Look at the expanse, with clouds on winter nights. Can you be sure it‚Äôs not the river? Look at the water, with reflected city lights. Can you be sure it‚Äôs not the heavens? There are ripples, imperfections in the skyline. You aren‚Äôt standing on solid ground. Look again, my friend, with your misguided eyes. You‚Äôre in an upside down town.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d0c5e899335586c070004c67a2d9af6c/5BE7DB9F/t51.2885-15/e35/16583388_262355137536088_6490351374222491648_n.jpg
Twenty ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ To my adolescence, Farewell. It‚Äôs surreal leaving you. I will miss a lot of the carefree adventures you gave me now that I saunter out of my teenage days and into the unknown with my heart tied tightly to Jesus Christ. I will remember you fondly, because it was in you that I learned the most about the future. It was surprising to me that adulthood is much more like childhood than everyone used to tell me, but the make-believe parts are rather hidden, in the later years. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôll strive tirelessly to make a difference, for the world needs to know that wisdom, when it is imparted from above, warrants simple truths that grown-ups tend to miss. If Peter Pan ever taught Captain Hook anything, it‚Äôs that without choosing to believe, losing the fight is inevitable. I cherished you. May I never go a day thinking I know enough. God is faithful to teach a curious child like me. From elsewhere, Cameron

Riveted ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I cannot help but feel rather lost in this world. It‚Äôs a good thing, too, because I know I am found in another world.

Hearts & Flowers ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My birthday is three days after Valentine‚Äôs Day, and my first name is an anagram for the word ‚Äúromance,‚Äù which was purely unintentional by part of my parents. And it only adds to the mystery that I tend to be a sentimentalist and my favorite color is red. These are all curious things I ponder on this day every year. So, to my darling, I want to tell you that I am waiting for you. We‚Äôll dance these fields for hours someday and our feet will get awfully sore. It won‚Äôt be wonderful all the time, but it will always be worthwhile. I pray endlessly that you fall in love with heaven the more you walk this earth, and I strive to do the same, with the hope that we‚Äôll fall together serendipitously. A hopeless romantic? That has always been a funny title to me. A hopeful romantic sounds better. Indeed, the yearning in my heart for love has already been met by its Creator, who fashioned both your soul and mine with perfect craftsmanship. Others might find it eccentric or saccharine, but we‚Äôll laugh about my name someday and I‚Äôll say the words God meant for every son and daughter whose paths have converged: ‚ÄúLittle time had passed by when I found the one my heart loves.‚Äù All I really know is that He is a poet and His people are poetry; and that every once in a grand while, He writes two stanzas that rhyme.

Redolent ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I stopped at an abandoned service station and closed my eyes to hear the sound of a 1942 Ford Super Deluxe humming as it stopped beside me. A sweet redolence. I opened my eyes, and my heart tugged at me to reminisce more. I think a memory never had is a possibility not yet touched. Maybe it‚Äôs okay to dream in black and white.

Cold Sweat ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ It's a curious thought that indeed fear cripples you by becoming your support. It keeps you standing, but it never lets you move without a limp, and what would happen if you fell? You‚Äôve never learned to grow. You knew these legs would not last on their own, after all. That‚Äôs why you left the crutches and turned to His love to walk again.

Wistful ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ This heartsick child needs His Father more than the simple words he plays can express. This weary soul aches for the days above. This heart longs to be cradled by merciful arms. Trade this trembling for His strength so that the bittersweet makes others crave heaven, like me. A fragment of eternity is felt in the wistful depths of my humanity. And in it is joy and security.

Sympathy ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ My heart turned softly on the sunrise. My apathy disappeared, without a trace. Inspiration touched the night skies, And just like that, the stars fell out of place.

February ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Giddy is the heart from affectionate feeling, For sentiment is felt in every fading branch. In the last wintry days the first buds are revealing A reminder of the taste of sweet romance. Holidays arrive by the catalogues, With Presidents, my twentieth, and Valentine‚Äôs. I shouldn‚Äôt forget to mention Groundhogs, For if the snow leaves, we‚Äôll have the signs. Such cold twilights and chills in the breeze Seem to be where my home belongs. Somehow not knowing puts me at ease, And did I forget to mention Groundhogs?

Vermilion ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Blend the colors of Your heart with brushstrokes across my eyelids that I may see the world in new dimensions of glory when I fall asleep under heavenly twilights.

Blinds ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ If I feel the sunrise, Its truth won‚Äôt leave me paralysed, For darkness blinds with its lies, But light only blinds the eyes. ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì An introspective self-portrait I took today. Check out my second account @lunardeep for my black and white photography. I‚Äôll be posting there more often.

Crescendo ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ You heard the sun descend‚Äî oh And its warmth dimmed like soft ivories, quiet, While the moon reached its crescendo; Such a tune to hum to‚Äî won‚Äôt you try it?

Illume ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ When I feel faint with shivers, And sparks around have dwindled, Let my heart be the embers In which Your light is kindled. üì∏: @zthompii

Bottled Sunset ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ He throws a bottle off into the blossoming night, And in it is captured the rest of the light. It shatters in the soil and pours into the depths, And now the earth holds some sun even after it sets.

Light Faucet ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ We must know how to love the Lord, and the only way is to know how He loves us. His love is not limited or exclusive. His love encapsulates all of Him. It is overflowing and spilling into every crack of our hearts. His passion in itself is enough to instill passion in us. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Matthew 22:37

Heartswept ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Even the breath of my lungs is not my own, so take it as you will, my Lord. May I fall into Your ever-present arms as the stars blanket this ethereal soul. May I tremble from the overwhelming warmth as Your sun sets in my pondering eyes. If my heart can be swept, let it be so.

Epochs ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAs for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, And its place remembers it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting On those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children‚Äôs children.‚Äù Psalm 103:15-17

Unfamiliar Skies ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Only the grounds you recognize, Strangely unfamiliar are the skies, For their air wears a cold disguise, And the clouds befall this home, Where the grass is overgrown, And the sun hasn‚Äôt shown; And all these moments waiting, This lost time was masquerading As footsteps you were never anticipating.
