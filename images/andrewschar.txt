To most, it’s just a picture of woman in a restaurant. For me, it’s sitting down to a glass of wine and a long overdue meal together, just the two (and a sleeping quarter) of us. It’s pretty hard to do once kids are in the picture and even harder once you live in the middle of nowhere. But super important. Kids steal some of the love that you pour into one another - so you have to be mindful of making time for one another. I am reminded of this after having lunch with, not just a fantastic mother of two, but my lovely wife, as tired as we both are 🤣...

This is our favourite game. Equally responsible for her safety, it’s a game of trust and exercise. She gets to defy gravity, I get a good bicep curl in. It’s a win win really. Thank you for capturing this 📷 so beautifully @theshanktank 👌🏼

We’re proud to welcome to the family, Max Anderson Schär, born at 7:52am on 25 June 2018. Our little lion 🦁 Mama @krystalschar is a pillar of strength and recovering well. And big sister @neveschar was so sweet with her little brother. All in all a day filled with anticipation, fear, awe, happiness, family, and a fair whack of opioids ;)

She’s the bravest human I know and she’s only 20 months old. Seriously, she just gets back up, ready for whatever’s next. #girlpower

It’s safe to say we had a fantastic adventure together 😘. Having kids seriously steals so much energy and time that used to go into one another and it’s important to find time wherever possible... We went on this trip freaking out. Neve had never slept a night away from us and has always been a tricky sleeper, but my mom and dad totally smashed it out of the park for us, giving us an adventure together that we’ll never forget. While it wasn’t a ‘relaxing’ holiday in the traditional sense, it was just what we needed to recharge our love banks in preparation for our next little human. Thanks @jillschar!!

Almost forgot... The best food we had on our trip has to go to @vegansprague - I was absolutely blown away by the coconut curry 🍛 Best I’ve ever had! It was also the only restaurant we did all three courses at because everything just sounded so delicious. Seriously, if you ever go to Prague, go here to get your feast on 😍

Day 5 // Prague. Taking a lift in an old Prague hospital in search of an English speaking doctor... I was in severe pain last night dealing with a sprained rib from before our trip, which, with all the walking we’ve been doing, decided to come back with a vengeance last night. Feels like a broken rib. So we spent half the day today trying to find a doc to give me a jova 💉and pain meds 💊... So it’s now a rest day for me while @krystalschar gets to explore Prague Castle. Really hoping I recover quickly since we’re only half way through our holiday 😔

On Friday morning I left Dundee at 4:45am and drove through the Tugela Valley towards Ballito. If you’ve ever driven through here, you’ll know that it’s a road full of potholes, patches without road entirely, donkeys, goats and what fees like the heart of Zululand. It’s chaotic and wild. A day before this, Zuma had stepped down and Ramaphoza had become our new president. I half expected some kind of unrest on my 3 hour journey through the back of beyond, but as I drove through Pomeroy, there wasn’t a single person on the street. Of course the time had something to do with it, and maybe it was just my imagination, but I like to think that the people were quite content that Zuma was gone. As if he wasn’t worth the effort to create some kind of unrest. Either way, I drove through feeling grateful for a peaceful transition of power. Maybe South Africa will be ok in the end. 🇿🇦

It’s hard to find a picture more apt than this in capturing Neve’s vibe... For a start it’s blurry. Because she never sits still. Then of course she’s covered in stains of all kind because she’s always getting her hands dirty (and lately, knocking her food out the way [and onto herself]). She’s almost always pointing at something and more recently adding “Oooh. Look at dat!” and “Der!” and “Daaaar!” Her Deutsch x English x Zulu melting pot is coming along nicely 😂 And then lastly her gaze. It’s incredible to see life as she sees it. Nothing is boring, everything must be explored. When she falls she gets back up without a whimper or a cry. She’s a trooper. Who just happens to be waking her parents twice a night now... Regression is a bitch 😑😝

I've been trying to build an app for 5 years. There are a lot of reasons why it’s taken me so long. None of them should be excuses. 5 years on, I'm finally close to launching the MVP, but it still feels like I’ll never get there or that someone else is going to beat me to the finish line with a better, shinier app. It's difficult to wrestle with those emotions. They make you feel like you’re an ‘almost’ person. • Everything to this point has relied on me. Spending countless hours refining the concept, teaching myself to use various software programs to design what I have in my head and put it into a working prototype, working extra jobs to raise enough capital for development, etc etc. But at this point I'm now reliant on the developers to turn my idea into reality. There doesn’t seem to be anything I can really do to speed that process up. It’s a helpless feeling. So in the meantime I’ve been focusing on the launch. And I've begun prototyping my next app. Because there are no guarantees in this game. This time round the time from idea to product will be much shorter. And so on and so on, until hopefully I succeed. • Why am I posting this? Because bootstrapping your own startup is lonely. And sharing helps make it less so. • 📷 by Cameron Anderson

A year ago today we were in the thick of things, the three of us. Praying for a natural birth, ending up in an emergency cesarian, God had other plans for mama and you. You've given us grey hairs and deprived us of much sleep, but we wouldn't change it for the world because you are worth every single day. Your courage and strength, your cheeky smile, your beautiful eyes, and your wonderful soul gives me purpose and drive. We are stronger because of you. And we love you beyond words. Always will. Happy 1st birthday 🎉 my kleine maus. Love Papa und Mama 😘

All too often I hear the words, "You better get your shotgun ready" or "Say hello to your girlfriend!" from parents who have little boys. And I get that it's mostly said in jest, but say it enough and it becomes a societal thought pattern... My daughter is not someone's girlfriend. Nor is it up to me to ward off the would be suitors. And I know this might annoy some people, but I really do believe society needs to stop treating women as if they're these weak little possessions that can't stand on their own two feet. If that's really the case, we're not raising our daughters right. I've said it before, but this quote says it far better than I can...

I'll be honest, there really isn't a lot going on in my life other than work and family, and I can't post pictures of work, so... Here's a picture of Neve 😜

So much love for these two ♥️ #luckiestmanalive

We're turning the derelict garage into a happy place for our cars. Starting with a new concrete floor. More to come.

I'll forgive you if you thought this post was about Neve since she is very much in the foreground of our lives at the moment, her mother marching on like a trooper in the background... It's so easy to get lost in the madness and excitement of a child, but we have to be careful not to forget how it all started. So no, this post is not about Neve, or her mother, it's about my wife, my best friend, my lover. Someone I fall more in love with with each passing day, and so, to my team mate in life I say: I was lucky enough to spend life with you in your twenties and tomorrow I get to start life with you in your thirties, and I can't wait! Here's to you @krystalschar, wishing you the happiest of birthdays and an incredible year ahead!! 🎈🎉🎂😘

This is the last picture I'll take of Cape Town for a while I expect. It should have been a picture of the winelands, because, let's face it, that has always been my happy place. But I've also always loved the drive via Chappies, so it'll have to do. It was rather fitting, I guess, that the day this was taken was one of the windiest days of the year. The cape wind has always annoyed me, and so in many ways the weather, with its beautiful light and ferocious wind that day, captured my emotions perfectly. I've had a love/hate relationship with Cape Town, although I think that can be said of any place, but I'll have to do a blog post on this because there's just too much to say. Nevertheless, in the 14 years I've spent in the mother city, I've grown and stagnated all at once. I've made and lost friends. I've been the saddest and happiest I've ever been... I never chose the easy road when it came to career choices and a lot of people have never understood that. I started out as a musician, became a photographer, wrote children's books, started a filmmaking business, became a composer, and for the last 3 years, a voice over artist with so many radio and tv ads you'll never know was actually me ;) It's been an incredible creative journey, learning new skills and moving on to the next. But all the while my priorities have been shifting. My incredible wife & daughter are the glue that holds me together, and that has focussed my eyes on what's really important in life, and so I am creating a new chapter for us. In my 10hr journey today I listened to many podcasts, but @dalepartridge's show on Family, Friendships, Finance & Fitness struck the most resonating chord with me as I realised that's exactly what we're focusing on in 2017 and the future. To our friends in Cape Town, we'll miss you, but remember, our door is always open.

Mothers are stronger and more determined than men will ever understand. I am literally floored by @krystalschar's consistent resilience and steadfastness as she selflessly gives of herself, 24 hours a day to love, cherish, and grow our little Neve. Mothers are the unsung heroes of this world. Men crumble at the repetitive torturous cries of a screaming child, but mothers just soldier on, giving their all. There is no harder, greater, or more important job in the world than raising children, and if you think otherwise, you've lost touch with reality. It saddens me that society hardly acknowledges mothers, and patronises women who opt to be full-time, stay-at-home moms, sacrificing their careers or goals for the good of their children. I know it's not Mother's Day today, but honestly, 1 day is ridiculous. Every day is #MothersDay. #mother #love

Fathers, we need to change our mindset around how we protect our little girls. We need to stop saying things like, "I've got my shotgun ready for when she starts dating". If we really want to protect our daughters, we need to teach them how to be treated. Show them how a man should treat a woman when you're with your wife. Take them to dinner and show them how they should be treated on a 'date'. Raise a strong, confident, caring, level-headed girl and when the time comes to protect your daughter, you won't need a shotgun; she'll waste no time on fools...

Ok ok, this is the last one I post of my beautiful wife before baba arrives 😉... Just figured why not, she's been such a champion throughout her pregnancy and deserves a gold medal🏅. Honestly, I couldn't have married better (yes I'm chuffed with myself) 🤓.

Even if you're not normally a documentary fan, I highly recommend you watch #MakingAMurderer... You can't make this stuff up. Seriously. Unbelievable story of Shakespearean proportions.

And this is the last of my #7FavTVShows, #TheNightOf. I posted about this a few weeks back after seeing only two episodes. It's not finished and yet it's easy to add this as one of the best shows I've seen. It's superbly shot & graded, with great actors and world class story. But what I really love is how it illustrates just how easily we shift our blame based on weak evidence. The realness of this show is 👌🏼 #referenceframez
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a2b1ef35826ed3d1aeecb862534b8561/5BCDC4CA/t51.2885-15/e35/13671878_1729636490622948_1821246833_n.jpg
#TheWalkingDead is a show you either love or hate, but make no mistake, it's not about zombies... It's a violent, gritty, painful look at what humans are capable of when they're at their worst and fighting for survival. It's Lord of the Flies all grown up, and while it certainly isn't perfect and could have done with a season or two less, the talented cast take you on a seriously emotional journey that's both uncomfortable and profound. #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

And then there's #HouseOfCards. The cool, calm, and corrupt, Frank Underwood, embodies all that is the world of politics, and I hate that I can't help but want him to succeed. But it's Spacey doing some of his best work with great storywriters and the only time I don't mind the 4th wall being broken ;) #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

Speaking of Colour Grading, #Hannibal is King... Colour Theory is superbly applied to every scene before the cameras even begin to shoot. It makes for a visual feast that expertly echoes the show's theme, so brilliantly brought to life by Mads as Hannibal. The score is an auditory experience to say the least and elevates the show immensely. In short, while those with a weak stomach won't be able to watch this, it's a buffet of genius that deserves an audience. #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

Speaking of Martin Freeman, he once again outdid himself on #Fargo S01. S02 was a whole new level though. Perhaps it's the quirky Candian-esque accents or simply the Cohen brother's ability to tell a story in a way you'd never expect, but I loved this. Phenomenal cast, superb performances from all, and fantastic attention to detail, including the colour grade. The music was great as always, but S01 wins the soundtrack award. #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

Then of course there's #Sherlock. Perhaps it's the nostalgia attached to it, or perhaps it's simply because of Benedict's stellar performance. But mostly I think it's Freeman's portrayal of Watson. That pensive, determined, stuffy-nosed companion that makes for the ultimate sidekick. #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

I think some of the best parts of #TheKilling were when Holder & Linden were in the car. The sound of the ever present Seattle rain on the roof, the cigarette smoke, the reflections and glass; It said so much without the need for dialogue. #7FavTVShows #referenceframez

For the last 2 months I've been frantically writing the music for our feature-film #Serpent. Creating that much music in a short timeframe is seriously intense. I probably haven't been the best husband to be around and my friends probably think I dropped off the map, but the good news is that besides some tweaking that will happen after the test screener, I'm pretty much done! Not sure when the cinema release is, but will post a pic of the poster and more details when I have them. For now though, look very carefully at the still frame above... What else do you see in the tent? The film stars #TomAinsley & #SarahDumont, written & directed by #AmandaEvans, produced by #AnantSingh and #GreigBuckle et al. #featurefilm #Serpent #serpentmovie #serpentfilm #blackmamba #capetown #southafrica

Besides... The drive out to Stellenbosch alone was worth it... Great reminder of the beautiful country we live in. To all my foreign friends, I know I'm so often morbidly negative about the political climate in SA, but it really is a country like nothing you've ever experienced before. So come visit and let's go wine touring together 🍷🍇...

What I love about this French Oak high chair I just bought, is that at one point the wood was a barrel that aged some of the insanely delicious Stellenbosch wine that I love so much. It didn't just get discarded... Instead an artisan took the time to make it into something that my kids will feast from and most likely even the grandkids... Sure, I could have bought a chair from Babies 'R Us for a few hundred bucks cheaper, but honestly it's all just rubbish Chinese plastic that just won't last and looks super ugly. So I'm pretty chuffed with myself right now 😜 #gearingupfortheoffspring

As many of you will know, 2015 was a terrible year for me. My neck injury sent me down a seriously dark road. I still live with pain every day, but I've learned to live with it. I don't want to be average - I want to be the best I can be, and so I made a vow at the beginning of 2016 to exercise every day and eat as healthily as I possibly can. It's been bloody hard, especially adapting to 5 days a week of strength and cardio training, and learning just how far I can push my body. But I've stuck at it and plan to continue to do so. Some days I'm able to go twice a day now, and I'm really starting to feel stronger and less injury prone. Anyway, I may post more exercise related stuff going forward. Hopefully I can transform into something I can be proud of, and perhaps one day even inspire someone else somewhere. To anyone else out there thinking about losing weight or getting fit or coming back from a serious injury, you can only do it if you want it hard enough. Sacrifices have to be made, but it's all worth it.

Quick trip up to Dundee for the #ironshough wedding with my partner in crime, @krystalschar. Special wedding and so great to see so many old family friends. They even managed to convince me to sing a song in the chapel ;) If you're not married yet, what are you waiting for!? #bonnieandclyde

You probably spend half your life fighting with your siblings, but in the other half you also get these wonderful moments where you can just enjoy each other's company... Was super rad having my brother in town for the weekend and I don't take for granted the fun we had together. My brother hasn't had a beer in 8 years (he doesn't really like the taste), but here he's doing a tasting at CBC with me because he knows it'll make me happy. #loveyoubro

#OldSchool. Shadows & Light at #AntonjiRupert Wines. The old Manor House is beautiful. Their flagship wines are seriously established and full of tannins. I'd recommend the Syrah and the Cabernet Franc, but they need fatty meats to pair with. Also, a sizeable bank account would help at R480 a bottle...

This place knows nothing of shopping malls and materialism and early risings to get to a meeting or a presentation. It is calm, solitary, confident and posed, and one heck of a place to find yourself on a ridiculously hot day high up in the mountains.

Quick shade break. As you do. Life out here is pretty harsh - when you find shade or water, you don't just walk past.

Hiking the reserve in search of rock pools, felt like we were in the Rocky Mountains. Extremely grateful to be able to do so - 8 months since my injury and getting out into the mountains has been awesome.

Decided to head into the mountains on the weekend. The sounds of the birds woke me up as the sun filtered through the trees, reminding me of the outdoors as a kid. One of my major goals is to create a life for my family away from the city, where my kids can ride horses and go fishing when they're bored. To quote @dalepartridge, "The lesson is this: God's nature has a purpose. If we lose our connection with it, we will find ourselves lost. Get to your forest."

A week ago we took a stroll through Montagu. When I walked past this church I realised that about 12 years ago I attended a wedding ceremony here as a complicated plus 1 for a girl I fancied who happened to be a bridesmaid - it ended up being a rather awkward day. Memories are interesting things.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fee0b34b24aa71305e6c1c95582f9f97/5BCCB062/t51.2885-15/e35/11849142_763279617114937_72480214_n.jpg
I saw this tree blossoming yesterday and was reminded that Spring is upon us. The late afternoon walk through the park was filled with jovial smiles and still, warm air - a taste of the summer to come. And as I looked at these flowers coming to life, it was apparent more than ever, that were it not for the winters, the springs would not be so pleasant - that if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. Spring is a time of rebirth, of new beginnings, with opportunities sprouting right and left. But without spring first, we couldn't get to summer - something I feel we need to remember. Dreaming about a goal is one thing, but getting there requires a slow and steady effort. There are two mistakes one can make in a journey... not going all the way, and not starting. And the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. So go do that thing you've been thinking about! Happy Spring my good people. And for my friends in the North, Jon Snow said it best when he said, "Winter is comin'" ;) #springtimebaby

I know it's just a picture of a ciabatta, but it's my ciabatta ;) Something I've been meaning to learn for a long time is bread-making. I don't know why it took me so long to get round to it, but pulling this fella out of the oven I had a feeling of #achievementunlocked 😋. Maybe because bread has been broken and shared amongst friends and strangers alike, for centuries. There's not much that can compete with freshly baked bread, a knob of butter, and a glass of wine. 🍞🍷. Shalom

Sometimes (often), I pretend I'm a French chef, preparing a dinner for a very special customer. I shutdown my computer which has filled my mind with work, stress (and stupid things like Fakebook), come downstairs, and begin the 'John Nash' process of figuring out what I could possibly conjure up with what's in the fridge. This is the exciting part. It's like a mystery box challenge. While I'm doing that, I'll turn on the sound system and select a 'French café' playlist. I'll set the lighting too - not too bright, music in the background. And for an hour or so, I'm transported somewhere foreign, 'unplugged' from the outside world. The complications, the frustrations, the whatevers... But it's so much more than just that. You see I get to cook for a very special customer. And nothing gives me more pleasure than when she arrives home  after a long day, drained, only to walk into a joie de vivre environment so to speak, music playing, the smells of a delicious meal wafting over her. For me, it is my way of showing my special customer how much I appreciate her. And luckily for me, I get to call her my wife. She is my quintessential partner in crime and in my eyes, no woman comes close. As with all hindsight, it's easy to say, but if I had it all over again, I'd have married her sooner! For those that are yet to graze a knee, stop wasting time. Marriage is a gift. @krystalschar you'll always be my special customer and I will cook delicious meals for you for as long as I live ❤️. I don't pretend to be a fancy chef, it's all just for fun, and that for me is the key. So often we try to turn our passions into work and then the passion fades. So last night, while is was in the 'South of France', I prepared a braised beef fillet, on a mustard cauliflower purée, with roasted sweet potato and sautéed green beans, with a mushroom balsalmic carrot & ginger jus, that was reduced for 60min. This was the end result. Plating is not my forte, but as with all things, I'll learn. Here's to the chefs out there that put blood sweat and tears into their dishes. Merci beaucoup 🇫🇷. Oh and tonight is Mexican 🇲🇽😎 #hobbychef #lovemywife #grateful

When you are wrestling within, look to the sea how it wrestles with the rocks. Over time, the rocks are simply an eroding obstacle, no match for the sea.

Tonight I swam for the first time since I tore my labrum in August, 2014, and of course since I slipped a disc 15 weeks ago. It wasn't a long swim, it wasn't a good swim, and it wasn't a pain-free swim... But it was a swim, and for that I am extremely grateful. I can't tell you how awesome it feels to be able to start doing things you've always taken for granted. I'm really hoping my body lets me do this more regularly - upwards, and onwards with the healing! #roadtorecovery #itsthesmallvictories

So the good news is that after 6 weeks I can finally walk around now without much pain in my neck. The bad news is that flying isn't my friend. Sitting is still a major problem. But at least I get to stand at the back and chat to the stewards. They're rad people with so many great stories to tell about travel. #findthegoodineverything

It's been a scary, painful two weeks for me. My spinal cord is on fire, I've hardly been able to turn my head, and most of the time has been spent lying down. Anti-inflammatories, painkillers and sleeping pills getting me through each day, but we still haven't figured out what's going on. Will hopefully know more this week. It's funny, it isn't until you get knocked down that you realise what you've taken for granted. Being healthy isn't a right, it's a privilege. It's out of my hands, but I just trust that I can come out of this with the ability to get healthy and strong again and never take anything for granted.

It is with immense pleasure that I can finally share with you my score that I composed for #INSTANCE! It's been a long, tough, exciting, and enjoyable journey, and I want to thank our writer/director @amandasieber for believing in me, and @mattdenni for his talent and skill with the violin in making #SuicidalWallflower & #TheWorldAbove sound way better than I could have ever imagined. Thanks also to @krystalsch, @jillschar & @jeffschar for all their support with this. I couldn't have done it without you! Link to the soundtrack is in my bio. PS, my favourite tracks are: #TheWorldAbove, #SuicidalWallflower, #TheWorldBelow, #WasSheEvenThere, and #FaithAsSmall. What Are yours?
