Decided to try out Fluid 100 paper, and I really like it so far.

I decided I wanted to draw @kaseythegolden’s oc. I think she’s cute and weird, so I definitely had to draw her.

Since I made a new oc who’s a cute vampire (haven’t named her yet), decided to do the #drawthisinyourstyle challenge! I’d love to see how everyone draws her. If you draw her, tag #scinsvampireoc (can also tag me). 🧛🏻‍♀️

Sorry I haven’t been posting much lately. I’ve been preparing for that art festival I’m going to, hopefully everything goes well during the event and that I’ll be back to posting more art more often in July!~

Just a simple drawing of a coffee cup ☕️

I love white hair, and creating characters with white hair is so much fun!

Planning up a bunch of artwork because I’ll be selling art at a festival near the end of June 😊

I got this paint set for travel and it’s so aesthetic, it’s pastel pink ♪( ´θ｀)

I love drawing plants 🌿🌱🌵

I think I might use white gel pens wayyy too much, cause I’ve completely run out the two I got in December T_T ~ Used washi tape to get the pattern on the sides.

I haven’t been drawing much lately. I just haven’t been enjoying my art, but definitely plan to push through and make some new paintings. Have a floating island.

Got business cards made that I can start putting in with Etsy orders ^^

Decided to use the left over paint from my last painting to make some more galaxy paintings.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4d338d0880c9b2959c7850b17b269f74/5BE8E06A/t51.2885-15/e35/29715182_421489774978116_1832748964240162816_n.jpg
Slowly getting out of art block. I actually like this one.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7f700939b4b6e8e303f6cd6fe7ca4453/5BD8D6D6/t51.2885-15/e35/29400764_239882909890398_6309545075105857536_n.jpg
Currently in an art block and not enjoying anything I’m attempting to draw. Hopefully that goes away soon. What do you guys do to help motivate you to draw? I have the feeling of wanting to,  but when I sit down to do it, nothing gets done >.< Anyway~ Have a ghost human and ghost kitty.

#Repost because I didn’t like the quality of the photo I originally posted.

Made some more galaxy paintings! ^^

I really want warm weather and for spring to get here. I felt that her outfit made me think of spring.

Was having fun with the galaxy paintings, so I decided to make a unicorn girl with a sort of galaxy inspired hair. I think she turned out cute.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/95f4334f8f92ee2beb662a13d128c6a3/5BCC5492/t51.2885-15/e35/28433334_202733863813749_840494631329202176_n.jpg
Made some galaxy space paintings tonight! They were fun to do, I think I’ll make some more soon enough. Qor paints work so well for the space look.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5a865b13e8a576c193775a378d8ca9de/5BDA887D/t51.2885-15/e35/28158609_173487330105988_3909085710182776832_n.jpg
Tried making the scene be snowy, but my gel pen smeared, so now it’s half snow and half leaves! I think she turned out cute regardless of the gel pen.

Witches are fun to draw! 🌟

I love drawing plants and people. I never draw animals cause’ they’re hard imo, but it was fun to draw this lil puppy, I think I’d like drawing more animals if I just practiced more. 🐶

Acrylic painting I did in January ~ ⭐️

Been having fun drawing things outside of the background （╹◡╹）

First painting using @qorwatercolors. I must say, so far I am very pleased with them. They’ve been so nice compared to my old Winsor & Newton and Van Gogh paints. If you’re interested in some new paints, I suggest looking into them! ^^ ~ I like this character I drew, I’m tempted to turn her into an OC.

I’m extremely afraid of bugs, but I freaking love drawing them. ~ A fly and a sort of Hercules looking beetle.
