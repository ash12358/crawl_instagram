Happy Birthday, Gramps! • The Nichols love to have babies in the summer for some reason. The 4th of the July week was stacked with birthdays. • The dopest strongest kindest and jovialest person you could have ever met. He hasn’t been with us since 1992 and I think about him all the time. Hearing my dad tell stories about him is one of my favorite things in the whole world. • #Cancerbaby #grandpa #WWIIvet #France

Dad • My silly, my guttural laugh, my curly hair, my work ethic, my desire to keep learning, and when I figure something out, and laugh like an evil genius...all comes from you. • You’re a beacon of chivalry and charm, everyone who meets you, likes you instantly, and anything that needs fixin, figured out, or handled, you got it.

I wrote a thing...cause he was my hero. • When I woke up this morning and looked at my phone, I felt something in my chest that doesn’t happen too often…thank goodness. I felt what can be best described as my heart exploding. I felt it burst and hit against my chest…and I could feel it falling down like shrapnel. And then almost on cue, the breath left my lungs, and I felt like I was paused in place. • Link in bio. • #AnthonyBourdain #RIP

Today, after years of elusion, I finally figured out how to make #cappuccinos on our office coffee maker. I tried before and made half attempts. I was heartbroken and quit. • Instead of working at it, I went out and got a hand frother and thought this would be how life would be here. But today I woke up, the sun was shining, my hair was bouncy, and I decided to give it a whirl again. And it finally happened. • Kids, never give up on your dreams. And if they seem tough to figure out, wait a few years and someone will finally make a YouTube video to show you what you’ve been doing wrong. • Also start saving for your retirement at 21. Peeps don’t tell you that enough. • #nespresso #cappuccino #dreams #cloudsinmycoffee

This homie is the bees knees. • Joined the military at 18. Got married at 19. Had her first kid at 21 - a kid who was 2 weeks late (and honestly still likes to arrive late to this day 🤷🏽‍♀️). And a second kid at 26. Lived all over the world, served her country for 25 years, and still killed at as a Mom. • I’m so lucky the universe saw fit that she be my Mom and I be her daughter.

Just THINKING about seeing this in person already has me in tears. Some of these stories of why they were lynched....are insane. • Like the teacher (Elizabeth Lawrence) walking home when a group of kids started to throw rocks at her. She reprimanded them. They ran home and told their parents. The parents came, lynched her, and burned her house to the ground. • #Repost @nytimes ・・・ A lynching memorial is opening — and the United States has never seen anything like it. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opens tomorrow on a 6-acre site overlooking Montgomery, Alabama, is dedicated to the victims of white supremacy. It demands a reckoning with one of the nation’s least recognized atrocities: the lynching of thousands of black people in a decades-long campaign of racist terror. Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the @eji_org, the nonprofit organization behind the memorial, decided that a single memorial was the most powerful way to give a sense of the scale of the bloodshed. For Bryan, the plans for the memorial and an accompanying museum were rooted in decades spent in Alabama courtrooms, witnessing a criminal justice system that treats African-Americans with particular cruelty, or indifference. And the museum is not a conventional one. It's probably better described as the presentation of an argument, supported by firsthand accounts and contemporary documents, that the slavery system did not end but evolved: from the family-shattering domestic slave trade to the decades of lynching terror, to the suffocating segregation of Jim Crow to the age of mass incarceration. @audramelton took these photos of @mempeacejustice and @legacymuseum.

Happy Birthday to this #hoecake! • I’ve met Julie two times. Once after a @misterryanadams concert for a hot second and then again at a Christmas party a year later. After that second meeting, I have talk to her every single day. Must of it’s just a bunch of bull shit, but it’s what the day requires sometimes. 💁🏽‍♀️ • Juju, you are crazy. And kind. You sometimes give me advice for the wrong things, but eventually give me the advice I need. I’m so happy to know you. I have absolutely no one to thank for that. 😂 Happy Level Up Day. I’ll talk to you later. • About these photos, tho. I called her to talk about something that was upsetting me. She sat her ass in her throne, with a perfect sun beam hitting her face, and had a photoshoot while listening to me. THEN, as I rambled on about my fucking feelings, she texted a dozen photos to me. I also hate her...🖕🏽 • #happybirthday #ihateyou #butiloveyoutoo #💕

#Repost @amplifierart ・・・ Artwork by @homsweethom and @laurenronquillo. Tomorrow, December 14th, the FCC is voting to dismantle Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality allows all websites and the information or products available on them to be treated equally. Without it, corporations like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast will be able to speed up or slow down websites based on their corporate or political interests. Essentially, Net Neutrality allows for equal opportunity access so that larger corporations cannot undermine small companies before they even have the chance to take off. This is essential for movements and grassroots organizations. Text RESIST to 50409 NOW to save #NetNeutrality.

Quite honestly, the only way to my heart at this point. #poetry • #Repost @katemadeira ・・・ Thanks to everybody that's reached out about making sure this piece got properly credited. I know it's an inevitability for artists in this internet age, but it's still frustrating when stuff like this happens. When I made this piece back in February, still especially raw and furious in the wake of the inauguration, I had no idea that it would get the attention that it has.  Seeing it get this resurgence of attention right now because of a preventable and senseless act of domestic terrorism in the name of white supremacy, it feels weird and crass to push for credit, especially as a white artist that literally just stress-stitched a sentiment of basic human decency as a means of coping with the fucked-up garbage age we've descended into. I am glad to have made something that has resonated with so many and I hope that we all keep fighting together to move towards equality, understanding, and a better day. I am really sorry if this is not particularly well-articulated...in between work and some recent occurrences in my personal life this month, I am pretty damn drained and have had a hard time finding words lately for pretty much anything beyond basic small talk and snarky comments. If you haven't seen it yet, multiple gofundme pages have been set up for the victims in Charlottesville. I've put up a link to the central one in my bio, but I will try to include links to some of the others in the comments if it will let me. Thank you and hope all of y'all are staying safe out there, taking care of yourselves and others, and getting some good hugs ❤️ Also FUCK NAZIS AND FUCK THE DIPSHIT FAKE PRESIDENT THAT'S ALLOWED THESE PASTY CLOWNS TO NOT ONLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH OPENLY HATING OTHERS, BUT EMPOWERED TO ACT ON THEIR DEPRAVED BELIEFS. All those creeps can sit and spin and if you're still defending your vote for 45 and trying to find reasons to defend him or those that committed this week's latest atrocity, well y'all can hop on too 🖕#fucktrump #fucknazis #notrumpnokkknofascistusa

After my Dad assembled my crib (probably without looking at the instructions) my Mama was worried about the sturdiness and my Dad decided the best way to ease her mind was for him to climb in. And then took the goofiest photo ever. • That's my Dad in a nut shell. Something needs to be done, he does it. Something worries my Mom, he eases her mind with more action than words. and when in doubt, make it silly. • I love my Dad more than words will allow me to tell you.

If you're not friends with @che11e_be11e.... you're losing at life, my friends. She is literally the coolest. We have gone from strangers, to boss and employee, to her introducing me as a co-worker (but me still going behind her back and say "actually she's my boss and she runs this motherfucker...") to friends, travel buddies, and workout homies. • That saying people use "To know them is to love them... was created for Michelle. And I'll fight you on that. • Happy #fuckforty, Michelle!!! #birthday #sugarbirthday #liverneedsabreak #makingthisishlookgood
