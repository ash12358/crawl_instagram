The landscapes of California and Australia have a lot in common (there‚Äôs a reason eucalyptus trees survive here), and that includes the shrinking wetlands. Wetlands are home to native plants, fish, birds, and other animals that are vital to the ecosystem. California has already lost 90% of its wetlands, so it‚Äôs important that we protect what we have left. #WalkaboutAustraliaInstameet Challenge 4

Another one from earlier. I was sitting on a bench about halfway down the pier, playing with the telephoto lens. I would have taken more, but I‚Äôm always paranoid that I‚Äôm going to drop my phone in the water (even when I‚Äôm on the Mark Twain at Disneyland), and I could feel the pier moving with the surf which freaked me out and got me up & moving. #ImperialBeach #SanDiego #IBPier #SilverStrand #CoronadoBridge #surf #surfers #skyline #SouthBay #PacificOcean #procamapp

It‚Äôs #OldHeadShotDay and I want to play too, but I‚Äôve never had headshots done so I‚Äôm taking a page out of @christy_taylor‚Äôs book and posting my senior picture. Yes, I had a relatively full head of pretty thick hair. But then college happened and teaching high school English happened.

One of the three murals painted in #ImperialBeach last week. This one was done by @carlyealey at 12th St & Palm Ave, and is my favorite of the three. You need to get down here and see them for yourself. (Couldn‚Äôt get good pictures of the other two because there were cars parked in front of them.)

One of three murals along Palm Ave in #ImperialBeach‚Äîall designed and painted by local female artists. If you haven‚Äôt been down to IB lately, you need to.

Sometimes your Alma Mater beats it‚Äôs in-state rival for a fourth time in six seasons. And sometimes the head football coach at your Alma Mater gets fired the day after beating your in-state rival for a fourth time in his six seasons with the team. So sometimes you get a celebratory/pick-me-up carne asada burrito, but sometimes the taco shop gives you a surf-n-turf burrito instead.

Was one of THOSE people Sunday with a #DCA #BlueWall picture, but failing at it by not really posing and not wearing any fan-made Disney gear (or any Disney gear, official or not).

Today is #NationalPurpleHeartDay and I though I'd take a minute to recognize my dad's brother, Leo, who earned his Purple Heart on 12 Feb 1968 while serving as an Air Combat Medic in the Quran Huong Tra Province. The 1st picture shows the Purple Heart medal next to the Bronze Star he was posthumously awarded. The second picture is from the ceremony when the medals were presented to my father, who was serving in the Navy at the time.

See this #LangstonHughes #bookmark? I snagged this from the library at Corona Del Sol High School while I was student teaching. That was the spring semester of 1999. It's beat up, but still in one piece. Who would have thought that a cheap strip of paper would last almost 18+ years? (FWIW, the copyright date on it is 1990.)

One of the first #Disney collectibles I owned was this @mickeymouse coin we received at #Disneyland in 1988. It's survived almost 30 years and multiple movies between San Diego and Phoenix, not to mention too many moves around the East Valley during my Arizona days. It's just one of those little freebies from the park that the hoarder in me will always keep. #TBT #ThrowbackThursday

Yes, we came to #Disneyland for fireworks. Yes, it is crowded. No, it is not hot (kinda humid, though). Yes, we're standing/sitting in one spot for 90 minutes for #MainStreetElectricalParade and then another 15-30 minutes or so after that for the fireworks. Yes, we are crazy. Happy 4th of July!

Slowly but surely, the #RiversOfAmerica is coming back to life. #Disneyland is handing these 6 cards out at various locations in #Frontierland, #NewOrleansSquare, and #CritterCountry.

Re-reading one of my favorite books. I was in junior high when "Field of Dreams" was released, and I fell in love with that film from the get-go. Not long after seeing it, my mom picked up a copy of the book it was based on for me. There are so many oddball characters and plot points that were cut from the film, but I love it's weird journey just the same.

There are a countless number of reasons why I love @balboapark. One of them is the California Tower and the music that comes from it every day. Many days it's like playing "Name That Tune" with those bells, but the song being played at noon o'clock today was an unmistakeable "tale as old as time." Thanks for the smile today, @museumofman. #BalboaPark #SanDiego #BeautyAndTheBeast #JuneGloom

My Uncle Leo was serving as an Air Combat Medic with the 1st Cavalry Division, and on February 12, 1968, just outside the city of Hue, his unit started taking heavy fire. According to his Distinguished Service Cross citation: "Seeing many casualties lying fully exposed to the enemy weapons, Private Dunsmore unhesitantly moved back into the open terrain to aid his comrades.  He repeatedly crossed the bullet-swept rice paddy to skillfully treat the casualties and carry them to safety." While treating the wounds of one of his fellow soldiers, my father's only brother was hit and killed by enemy fire. Leo has two generations of nephews and nieces who were never able to meet him. This is why you'll never hear me say "Happy Memorial Day." It's a time to reflect on the lives of those service members who never made it home. Honor the fallen, and thank those who made it home.

While in #BalboaPark today, I saw this couple taking (what I assume to be) engagement photos, another couple doing "hey, we're having a baby" pics, and two other couples taking wedding pictures. It was early enough that I wasn't trampled by graduation and prom picture-takers, thankfully.

I've loved Bald Eagles since I was a kid, and I'm happy that the two at the Safari Park are healthy after being injured. They can't fly anymore, and I don't like seeing them behind a fence, but they're alive & healthy. And they seemed annoyed by the very vocal parrots next door.

This is my great-grandmother, Little Gramma Dunsmore. She used to march in every parade when my dad was a kid, and even though I never knew her, I'd like to think she would have been proud to see so many women voicing their opinion across this great nation of ours today. I don't care what your politics are, where you grew up, what you do for a living, what religion you practice, or if you pee sitting down or standing up--the government is supposed to protect the rights of ALL Americans that are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.

It's that time of year. The first two dozen oranges have been picked, so if anyone wants to make juice, orange chicken, a homemade Orange Julius, beer, or whatever, let me know and I'll set some aside. More to come, too. If you're wondering how local these are, the tree they grow on has had a view of the ocean and Mexico for around 50 years.

Still waiting for the Main Street Electrical Parade, and it needs to hurry up because I'm old. #MSEP #Disneyland *UPDATE*: I stood in that spot for two hours, then recorded the entire parade (all 20 minutes of it), even while my left foot fell asleep. Unfortunately, the video app failed and it didn't save the recording.

Still cloudy, but the rain has stopped for a little while. I'd be dry if not for the inch of water on the floor of the Matterhorn bobsled.

Was asked about a favorite Christmas memory yesterday. One of mine involves my Aunt Gladys, and I've been thinking about her a lot since. She passed away in 2001 and left a void that cannot be replaced. This picture was taken in 1983--Dad is just ahead of her and I'm on his left (the dork in a plaid shirt, and are those green pants?).

Huzzah for #books! 3rd copy of #WhereMenWinGlory I've owned because #PT42 (and I loaned the other 2 out & didn't get them back, but that's ok), but this edition has been more/new info thanks to the Freedom of Information Act. #HauntedMansion is illustrated with scenes from the attraction and the lyrics to song, with a CD of the song. And as most of you know, I do love me some books about baseball!

Haven't been able to get near the statue today, so here's an old one. Walt would have been 115-years old today, and if I had a time machine, I'd go back to 1954 to give him some cash so he could buy a few more acres of land in Anaheim. Would have been a nice ROI, too. #Disneyland #WaltDisney
