Went for a short hike to a lighthouse and found houses sitting the rocky shores of Nova Scotia. While I’m certain the view must be great, I wonder where they go grocery shopping because there weren’t any stores nearby! . #imagesofcanada #canadiancollective #passionpassport #hikingadventures #ilovehiking #nature_sultans #nikon_canada #natureaddict #visitnovascotia #igers_novascotia #igersnovascotia #explorecanada #opcmag #sharecangeo #cangeo #oceanliving #lonelyplanet #whpjourney #digitalphotoacademy

Today I’m throwing it way back to that morning at Blue Rocks, Nova Scotia where I witnessed the most magical of sunrises in all of my trip. Everything was so still, nobody was around, and I was there enjoying every second of it...that is, until my hunger got to me and I had to go back to eat some breakfast. . #passionpassport #visitnovascotia #explorecanada #ig_exquisite #igers_novascotia #igersnovascotia #ig_masterpiece #sunrise_lovers #sunrise_madness #sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld #imagesofcanada #torontoclx #reflectiongram #sharecangeo #cangeotravel #enroutemag #aircanada #flyswoop #bluerocks #torontoblogger #digitalphotoacademy

Golf-green lawn. This looked fabulous contrasting with the pink skies from the evening sun. While I waited for something interesting to happen along the Lunenburg harbour, I turned my camera to the side and thought to myself, now how do I get a lawn like this for my home? . This in fact is the property of a golf course just across the pond from the harbour! . #lunenburg #lunenburgcounty #visitnovascotia #novascotia #igers_novascotia #explorecanada #opcmag #cangeo #sharecangeo #cangeotravel #enroutemag #golfcourse #sunset_vision #sunset_pics #passionpassport #golfchannel #canadiancollective #imagesofcanada

It’s the subtle yet expressive nature that are visible in these pieces at the Mosaïculture Gatineau that really got to me. I’m working on a blog post that will show you more of these pieces but if you’re in the Ottawa area in the interim, I encourage you to visit them!

After shooting the sunrise by the Point at Blue Rocks, we went on a morning kayak ride through Miller’s Pass. I loved going through narrow passageways and seeing where we ended up. I wanted to see the seals but they were a little too far away and we were pressed for time, so it’s just another excuse to come back here again. I didn’t realize at the time I booked my Airbnb here but this part is one of the best places to kayak in all of Nova Scotia. And now that I’ve been here, I know why! . #igers_novascotia #nikon_canada #enroutemag #exploreeverything #igersnovascotia #visitnovascotia #kayaking #kayakingadventures #pleasantpaddling #bluerocks #explorecanada #wildernessculture #neverstopexploring #passionpassport #travellingthroughtheworld #sharecangeo #cangeotravel #opcmag #exploremag #imagesofcanada #canadiancollective

As a photographer it’s always exciting to visit new places, and my time at Peggy’s Cove did not disappoint. I arrived before sunrise and stayed until after lunch, which was quite possibly the best tasting lobster I’ve ever had! . Now on the blog, my photographic adventures at Peggy’s Cove!

Blue Rocks is named after the bluish-gray rocks that you find all along the Shores here—although you may not be able to see them here, as it reflects off the sunlight. In the distance to the far left you can see some of the huts and the launch area for kayaks and SUPs. . #nature_sultans #travellingthroughtheworld #hikingadventures #cangeo #nikon_canada #enroutemag #visitnovascotia #exploreeverything #explorecanada #ig_masterpiece #igersnovascotia #sunrise_madness #torontoblogger #natureaddict #bluerocks #igers_novascotia #niche #canadiancollective #eastcoast #imagesofcanada

I hadn’t seen a vibrant sunrise in a while so this was refreshing! Woke up at 4:30am that morning to find the skies a burning red from the window of my Airbnb. I got out, and drive to the Point, and watched as the skies turned to orange, yellow, red, and blue. It was a magnificent sunrise. . #travellingthroughtheworld #nikon_canada #sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld #sunrise_lovers #sunrise_madness #lunenburg #bluerocks #fishinglife #fishingboat #explorecanada #visitnovascotia #lunenburgcounty #cangeo #enroutemag #opcmag #cangeotravel

Established in 1753, this UNESCO World Heritage Site of Lunenburg is such a charming town, and we arrived just in time for the sunset too. As a bonus, the famed Bluenose II was also here when we arrived—can you spot her in this image? . #visitnovascotia #explorecanada #lunenburg #bluenoseii #travellingthroughtheworld #exploreeverything #nikon_canada #sunset_vision #canoeing #fishingboat #fishingvillage #torontoblogger #harbour

In one week I saw real fishermen and lobster traps in Halifax, Nova Scotia and then saw them recreated in this fantastic exhibit out in Gatineau, Quebec. The Mosaïculture Gatineau 2018 is a journey through 45 magical floral masterpieces that will have you in awe at every turn. If you’re in the Ottawa area before October 15, 2018, I highly recommend you visit here—it’s unlike anything I had ever seen before.

At about 7am, I went to the fishing village just down the street from the lighthouse where I had the sites all to myself once again. I loved the old fishing huts perched atop the granite rocks, as well as the boats that were docked nearby. Just a brief walk around the bay offers a number of wonderful picture opportunities. . Just be warned, with stores closed until 10am, you will need to wait until 8:30am for a bathroom break and breakfast, at the restaurant and gift shop by the lighthouse. . #explorecanada #visitnovascotia #discoverhalifax #peggyscove #fishinglife #imagesofcanada #enroutemag #cangeo #cangeotravel #opcmag #travellingthroughtheworld #torontoblogger #torontoartist #passionpassport #bloggerlife #reflection_perfection

Peggy’s Point Lighthouse may very well be the most photographed lighthouse in Canada—and maybe even the world. With its bold red and white exterior towering above the rocks contrasting with the blue of the ocean, it’s certainly one very picturesque lighthouse. It’s just a 45min. Drive away from Halifax so it makes for a great side trip. . Making it here for a sunrise is a different story though. Waking up at 3:30am and driving on unfamiliar grounds in the middle of the night, we arrived here shortly before 5am. There were a couple of other photographers already there but they went their own ways, allowing me to have the iconic lighthouse all to myself. . The crowds? They didn’t show up until at least 9am, which meant several hours of pure photo fun! . #discoverhalifax #visitnovascotia #explorecanada #nikon_canada #imagesofcanada #lighthouse #peggyscove #peggyscovelighthouse #reflection_perfection #cangeo #cangeotravel #canadiancollective #torontoblogger #torontoartist

Went over to the harbour in Dartmouth to catch a stunning sunset. It was a beautiful way to end a long day of sightseeing. . I would definitely recommend this vantage point since you can see everything from the Macdonald Bridge to the Halifax Harbour and Georges Island (shown here). #visitnovascotia #discoverhalifax #explorecanada #nikon_canada #enroutemag #halifaxharbour #opcmag #cangeo #cangeotravel #imagesofcanada #yachtlife #sailing #nature_seekers #nature_sultans #downtowndartmouth #torontoblogger #torontoartist #moodygrams

Point Pleasant Park is just a 30 min. Walk away from downtown Halifax, and if offers a spectacular view of the mouth of the Halifax harbour. It also has a number of hiking trails that are so refreshing in the morning that it was the perfect place to start off our first full day in the city! . #visitnovascotia #discoverhalifax #halifax #explorecanada #hikingadventures #nikon_canada #nature_sultans #nature_seekers #natureaddict #torontoblogger #torontoartist #igers_halifax #sunrise_lovers #sunrises #sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld #travellingthroughtheworld #imagesofcanada #enroutemag #moodynature #moodynature_elite

Confronted yet again with a flock of cormorants, I decided to test my luck with photographing them in motion.

Kayaking has been my favourite water sport as of late. I even thought about buying my own last year but with limited storage at home and having to carry it on my small car, I figure it would be best to just rent it when I want one.

I sat on a rock for about an hour or so just admiring these cormorants as they flew directly in front and above me. Seeing these in a large number like this was quite striking.

Good morning Toronto! I’m starting the week off with one of my favourite shots from last week’s sunrise.

Although yesterday’s sunrise was absolutely gorgeous, I wasn’t able to see any Whimbrels migrating over Lake Ontario. There were a few thousand that had flown by on Wednesday during the day, so that must have been the main pack, unless more had flown by after I left that morning.

The cherry blossoms at High Park are about 80% bloomed now, which means they are peaking right about now.

Sunny days are ahead. Some of you may know that although I love landscape photography, I’m also an event photographer, capturing essential moments throughout events and festivals. If you’ve seen my Stories, you’ll know that I’m photographing HotDocs again this year. And that only means one thing for you—FREE festival passes! If anyone wants one, you’ll have to meet me wherever I am downtown. Just DM me if you’re interested and I’ll pick randomly if I get more people than I have passes...which is a very limited number. . #thelast6 #6ixwalks #torontopfr #humberbaypark #seagulls #lakeontario #rockybeach #opcmag #cangeo #bricks #torontoblogger #torontoartist #bloggerstyle #bloggerlife #toronto #torontoclx #passionpassport

El Corazon, had a short but fruitful appearance at Humber Bay Shores Park. He was washed away this past weekend from the harsh storm that washed huge rocks, branches, and garbage across the shores of the park. Thanks to the local artists that dedicated their time and effort in erecting him, and the now-washed Away Toronto Love sign as well. . #torontosunriseseriesbytaku #elcorazon #thelast6 #6ixwalks #blogto #curiocityto #narcitytoronto #torontopfr #cityofto #torontoartist #torontoblogger #bloggerlife #bloggerstyle #sunrises #mycntower #opcmag #enroutemag #sharecangeo #cangeo #wethenorth #streetsoftoronto #perspective

As soon as we parked the car and got out, a lady came out of this restaurant asking us if we would like to eat there for lunch. We weren’t planning on it, but she insisted she had some great noodles. How can I say no to that? The view was amazing, and so were the noodles.

As I walked to the subway station on Monday, the sky and clouds were on fire. The reds and oranges were so vibrant I was kicking myself for not being by the lake.

I’ve always had a fascination with wildlife, but it wasn’t until the last couple years that I’ve actually started to enjoy seeking them out and photographing them. . This beautiful Northern Pintail was taken at Ueno Park in Tokyo last year. I was limited by my 200mm lens, which is considered short for wildlife photography. . I’m thinking a much longer lens will benefit me in this case.

One of the best parts of Ueno Park in Tokyo is this marshland that is home to several species of birds, including this egret. I spent a good while here just watching the birds fly in and out from the nearby pond. In the back, you can see the walkway that goes through a canopy of cherry blossoms, which is another popular spot for bird watching and sakura viewing. . #tokyo #uenopark #ueno #cherryblossom #sakura #egret #birdsofinstagram #marshland #pond #japan_focus #visitjapanjp #explorejapan #tokyocameraclub #discoverjapan #ilovejapan #birding #nature_lovers #nature_photo #lovers_nippon #japan_daytime_view #enroutemag #cangeotravel #japan_photo_now

Diamond Fuji refers to the time when the sun rises at the peak of Mt. Fuji, Japan’s most revered mountain. Double diamond Fuji refers to when this moment is also reflected on a body of water. . Last year I was fortunate enough to capture this moment at one of the more picturesque locations, Tanuki Lake.

Almost didn’t catch the morning light here because I came too late. I still very much enjoyed the stillness of the water with that glow you can only get from a sunrise. .

When you think of beaches and boardwalks in Toronto, your initial instinct is probably to think of Woodbine beach out in the east end of the city. The west end, however, has its boardwalk and beaches as well, and shouldn’t be missed, especially during a sunrise! . #torontosunriseseriesbytaku #blogto #sunriseto #winterto #curiocityto #narcitytoronto #streetsoftoronto #6ixwalks #seetorontonow #nikonca #cangeo #sharecangeo #opcmag #enroutemag #sky_sultans #sky_perfection #sky_brilliance #torontoblogger #torontoartist #bloggerlife #bloggerstyle #beaches #sunrises #imagesofcanada #explorecanada #discoveron

Last year, my wife and I drove around the north end of Mt. Fuji, discovering new sights and good eats along the way. We would stop at random locations if we thought the area looked interesting—needless to say, our drive took a long time!

Losing one hour of sleep today means the sunrise will be that much later, making it easier for everyone to see and appreciate.

I’ve had a couple people message me about cherry blossoms in Toronto already. While it’s still too early to tell when they will peak here in Toronto, they usually do around the first week of May. Tokyo will be seeing their peak season arrive a couple days early this year though. This was taken near Lake Kawaguchi where the trees lining the lake were at their peak. What a gorgeous sight it was. I had a chance to drive around Mt. Fuji last cherry blossom season so I hope to share some of those pictures with you too. . #visitjapan #visitjapanjp #ilovejapan #japan_focus #explorejpn #explorejapan #experiencejapan #mtfuji #mountfuji #fujisan #kawaguchiko #cherryblossom #sakura #sakura🌸 #nature_brilliance #nature_sultans #nature_lovers #torontobloggers #torontoartist #bloggerlife #bloggerstyle #flower_daily #ig_japan #ig_japanese #floral_perfection #flowerpower

When is the horizon not straight? If you look closely here you can see that the horizon is jagged from left to right. The waves coupled with the sun reflecting on the surface makes this a unique sight to see. .

The feeling I had that evening looking beyond the Hamilton Harbour was so surreal that I actually got off the Skyway and turned back to get a picture. It may not seem like much from this one photo but seeing the wide open horizon and the subtle peaks on the clouds made it look like these were mountain peaks peaking above the cloud line. That was a beautiful drive home. . #hamont #hamilton #discoveron #explorecanada #enroutemag #cangeo #sharecangeo #cangeotravel #blogto #narcitytoronto #curiocityto #visitsouthernontario #sky_perfection #sky_brilliance #sky_collection #sky_sultans #sky_painters #passionpassport #torontoblogger #torontoartist #sky_scapes #sky_captures #wallart #interiordesigninspiration #interiordecorating #wallartdecor

For those of you who are interested in attending the Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors exhibit @agotoronto, I have compiled a Photographic Guide for you, showing what you can expect from this show. The guide comes from a photographer’s point of view, so I give you my settings for each room. I do encourage you to try and not to take many photos in the room though, since you only get 20-25 sec. inside. That time goes by really quickly and it would be a shame for you to not experience the exhibit to its fullest. . View the guide here: https://wp.me/p2GZe2-1Yc .

Good morning Ottawa! Many people may not know that I grew up in Ottawa. After moving to Toronto, I drove back and forth several times, visiting my friends. This time, I was able to enjoy myself on my way here with the comfort and convenience that @viarailcanada provided me. I have to say, it was nice not having to worry about driving all the way here again! #viarail40 .

One look at this and you may wonder where in Toronto this would be! This was taken with a 20mm wide angle lens, where I tried to capture the vastness of the lake by Humber Bay. The bright sun on the left pretty much over exposed the fog on the lake, but man what a sunrise this was! . #torontosunriseseriesbytaku Http://www.smaku.com/the-first-light #pastels #pastelsky #sky_sultans #torontoart#torontopfr #blogto #sunriseto #winterto#thelast6 #6ixwalks #curiocityto#foggymorning #awesome_shots#awesome_naturepix #ig_nature #livefolk#landscape_lovers#sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld#sunrise_sunset_photogroup#moodynature #torontoblogger #torontoartist #bloggerstyle #mist_vision

There is something special about each sunrise shoot that I go to, even if it is overcast. At first, I thought this particular morning was a bust: too much cloud coverage, gray all over, and nothing too exciting to photograph. As the morning went by, something started happening in the clouds though. One particular area in the clouds started glowing white and was much brighter than anything else around it. It was almost surreal—I didn’t know what was happening. I started taking pictures of this anomaly and it wasn’t until I looked at my pictures on my computer that this bright spot in the clouds was actually reflecting the colours from the sun. The coloured clouds had spread by the time I took this one, but you can still see the colour difference from the blue tones found everywhere else. .

I’m glad I made it here just before the clouds covered over the colours that were there from the evening’s sunset. . Located by Spencer Smith park in Burlington, the Brant Street Pier juts out 137 metres over Lake Ontario, and does it with style as it curves its way outward. The colour of the beacon changes to represent special events and activities throughout the year. . #sunset_ig #burlingtonontario #brantstreetpier #tourismburlington #discoveron #spencersmithpark #pastels #pastelsky #sky_sultans #torontoart #blogto #winterto#thelast6 #6ixwalks #curiocityto #awesome_shots #livefolk#landscape_lovers#sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld#sunrise_sunset_photogroup#longexposure_shots #longexpoelite# #moodygram#torontoblogger #torontoartist #sharecangeo

When is the sun not round? When it’s right at the horizon making its bright light look like its part of the sun. . I’m also liking how the horizon is not flat here, but very rough and rocky from the waves of Lake Ontario. .

There’s something interesting going on here...and I don’t meant the swans. It’s the two layers of clouds, each doing their own thing. The low-laying clouds are puffed up and slow moving while directly above them are faster moving ones.

Good morning Toronto! Use layers in your image to add more depth. The layers of buildings and trees at the horizon divides the pink and purple sky and water: the buildings in the back are lighter than the trees in the foreground.

Some have asked me about the tagging of these swans, as seen in my Stories. These trumpeter swans were locally extinct at one point. They were however reintroduced in Ontario over the last few decades, using eggs from western Canada. In an effort to maintain these swans, volunteers tagged them so they could monitor their whereabouts and health throughout the year. They are known to migrate to Lasalle Park in the winter as they like the open, shallow waters, and the abundance of food nearby. . The orange colour seen above is due to the rust and them constantly feeding under water. #hamiltonontario #hamont #winterto #blogto #cangeo #sharecangeo #opcmag #wildlifeonearth #swans #trumpeterswans #birdsofinstagram #birdstagram #livefolk #folkart #folkscenery #discoveron #burlingtonontario #wildlife_perfection #passionpassport #torontoblogger #torontoartist

Today marks the start of my fifth year with my #TorontoSunriseSeriesByTaku!The sunrise of February 8, 2014 was pretty much what started the series. It was also a frigid winter that year but the sunrise wasn’t anything too spectacular—it was apparently pretty enough to make me go back again afterwards though (and I’m thankful for it!).

Last week for #waterfallwednesday I mentioned photographing things up close. Here’s a great example of how I like to capture texture in my photos. A not-so long exposure shot of the raging Niagara river at sunrise produces the metal-like texture of the water. The river is moving so fast over all the rocks creating the beautiful curves you see here. . #abstractionseriesbytaku #niagarafalls #niagarariver #visitniagara #niagaraparks #longexposure_shots #longexpo_addiction #water_brilliance #wallart #walldecor #elledecor #wallartprint #abstractphotography #abstraction #abstractexpressionism #discoveron #explorecanada #opcmag #cangeo #sharecangeo #cangeotravel #ig_longexposure

That morning when the wind was so strong it brought large waves all across Lake Ontario. Standing by the shoreline, I had to take shelter behind these rocks as the waves crashed so violently on them.

When you visit Niagara Falls, we tend to always focus on the grandeur of the Falls. However seeing the Falls with a 200mm focal length means I can focus on one particular area of the Falls, bringing in more attention to the areas that most people will likely not even notice in the bigger picture. . The crack in the ice and snow here got my attention, in addition to the sunlight shining through the trees on the top left making an almost angelic feel to this photo. .

I went for a sunrise shoot at Niagara Falls a couple weeks ago and ended up shooting a moon set photo instead. . What was interesting about this place was the moon was visible in the same direction the sun would be when it rose, so I didn’t even have to change locations. .

Running through #the6ix during a sunrise. . Are you a morning person or a night owl? I always find it interesting to see who is out there when I go out for a sunrise shoot. There are the morning runners, the dog walkers, and even cyclists in the wintertime. . I also find that when I’m all set and done, and am heading to my car, the birders come out to seek out the many species that make Toronto their home. If it weren’t for my grumbling stomach by that time, I would almost be inclined to stay and photograph the birds too! .

Many of you may be wondering where all of my colourful CN Tower sunrises are these days...what? You’re not? Well, I’ll share with you anyway that it’s as simple as knowing where the sun is rising now. In the winter, the sun is quite far from the Toronto skyline, and rises in the middle of nowhere along the horizon and Lake Ontario. . This may not make for pretty skyline pictures (unless you get massive reflections from clouds along the skyline), but it opens up new doors for photographing the atmosphere, birds of Lake Ontario, and anything else you find in the lake. . I take this opportunity to scout for ducks, geese, swans, and the like and photograph them in as creative a way as I can. . It’s not the end of skyline pictures though. We just have to wait for that one magical morning to come! . This is proudly part of my #torontosunriseseriesbytaku .

The lighthouse amongst the morning light. I wouldn’t go so far as to call this a sunrise, although it sure looks like one. This was taken around 9:20am which is well after the sun had risen.

I finally have something to post for #waterfallwednesday! . The US side of Niagara Falls often gets overshadowed by the Canadian side, but when I went this past weekend, I have to say one of my favourite pictures comes from the US side! . The early morning sun shining through trees, casting its warm glow onto the Falls itself, and to the cliff side was magical. Marry that with the ice covered cliff and snow capped trees, and you get this perfect winter wonderland of a photo! . 2 sec. exposure with a B+W circular polarizer and 3-Stop ND filter . #explorecanada #travelon #travelontario #discoveron #discoverontario #niagarafalls #niagaraparks #niagarafallsusa #niagarafallscanada #discoverniagara #discoverearth #blogto #winterto #sunriseto #narcitycanada #culturetrip #passionpassport #niche #enroutemag #travelawesome #longexpoelite #masterclass #longexposure #schneideroptics #cangeotravel #opcmag #cangeo

Everyone loves...Niagara Falls! Past the pillow-like waters, on the other side of the road, and beyond the bare-branched trees, you’ve reached Marineland Niagara Falls! .

There was an explosion of colours this sunrise on top of this interesting weather phenomenon where steam rose up from the lake to the low-laying clouds. It seemed like  something straight out of Hollywood North! . A reminder that my First Light Sunrise exhibit is now on this year until March 17!

It’s been a must-go place to see a sunrise for me for the last few years but I just hadn’t been able to get there until yesterday. . Niagara Falls is a great place to see the sunrise and experience Mother Nature’s raw power simultaneously...and yesterday’s sunrise did not disappoint. . From pink and magenta hues to an orange and yellow glow, the sun peaked above the horizon with the tea kettle effect above the lake. It was definitely a sunrise to remember...and worth waking up at 4:30am! .

Good morning Toronto! . Well, it looks like there wasn’t enough of a temperature difference this weekend to get that fog above the lake. Nonetheless, the sun is out and it’s a clear day ahead.

Flying back to the deep freeze this weekend. We’re starting the day off at +12C and ending it off at -12C! . The drastic change in temperature can often result in some heavy fog above the lake. Be on the lookout for that this weekend! .

Looming Toronto . For the longest time I always thought this mirage-like skyline was in fact the real skyline. But a closer examination reveals the CN Tower is not surrounded by other buildings, and there are gaps along the horizon where buildings should be, making this skyline...different. . I took this three years ago along the shoreline in Hamilton when winter was quite fierce then too. . After a bit of digging around, I came across a weather phenomenon called Looming, where atmospheric refraction bends light allowing us to see what we would normally not see on normal days. I don’t actually know if you can see Toronto’s skyline like this from Hamilton’s shores on a regular day, but part of me thinks it’s better left unknown! . Anyone know what’s happening here? . #hamont #toronto #torontolife #thelast6 #blogto #winterto #narcitycanada #curiocityto #torontoclx #hamilton #seetorontonow #6ixwalks #cangeo #opcmag #weathernetwork #theweatherchannel #looming #canadiancreatives #mirage #illusion #lakeontario #myhamilton

Why don’t I include people in my landscape photos? . I want to be able to depict nature as I see it in front of me. To me, when I include someone in the photo, I find the focus of attention shifts towards the person no matter how small they may be in the frame. This takes away from seeing the raw beauty of nature. I prefer the viewer to be able to connect more with the scenery and it’s power, beauty, and awesomeness. . There are times when adding a human element can work though—for example when using them as a point of reference to show how tall a waterfall or tree may be—I’ve done this many times in the past. . There’s really no right or wrong way about it—it’s just the way I do my landscapes. . What about you? Do you prefer to see a human element in landscape photos? . .

Focus on the uniqueness in front of you. . This is what I always tell students in workshops and photo walks that I lead. Wherever you may be, there will always be something unique or different about it. Capture it, and you will have a photo to remember. . In this case, I wanted to capture the cold winter scenery, in addition to the tea kettle effect (fog above the lake). . The bay where I was at froze over so I ran to the middle of it and took this, making sure to include the footprints in the snow as well. . #torontoclx #blogto #winterto #sunriseto #thelast6 #winterwonderland #foggymorning #mist #hubs_united #ig_cameras_united #etobicoke #iceskating #mycntower #photography101bytaku #urbanromanix #cangeo #opcmag #cangeotravel #nikonca #enroutemag #globewanderer #earthpix . #torontosunriseseriesbytaku

Do I use any filters on my lenses? . Depending on the picture that I’m after, I do. A polarizing filter can do wonders to your images when you want that richness in colour in your skies, or if you want to reduce reflections on the water or glass. I use a 77mm B+W circular polarizer for this. . If I want to do long exposures during sunrises or during the day, I have a 77mm B+W 3-stop neutral density (ND) filter. The above filters are 90% always together so I get about an extra 5-stops out of this combination. . For my 14-24mm however, I use the Big Stopper by Lee filter. It’s a 10-Stop ND filter (150mm x 170mm) that lets me shoot in minutes and not seconds, during the day. . The use of filters allows for more creativity in your photos so I love to experiment with them. I have an order for a 6-Stop ND and a 3-Stop hard reverse filter for my 14-24mm from Breakthrough Photography, and am anxious to get them...if they ever finish making their larger filters! . Which filters do you use, if any? Are you happy with them? Tell me more below!

This is a long exposure to make the water smooth and pearly white. I intentionally left an open space by the right of the rocks to connect the water from the top to the bottom, making it wrap around the shoreline. This in effect allows our eyes to move from the bottom of the frame to the top, or vice versa. . The shoreline and water now hug each other. .

This was #shotoniphone believe it or not. There was a hole in the ice on the ground with an opening just large enough for me to be able to put my phone in and take the shot. . I had my Nikon with me but when that won’t do, your phone is still a great go-to camera! . Even though I have a dslr, there are many times when I still use my iPhone to help me with my photos. For example, I use the phone screen to help me with my composition at times by changing the crop, pinching and zooming and seeing what works best when I’m out in the field. Try it out next time and give your phone the love that it deserves. . #icicles #winterto #blogto #educationfirst #education #photography101bytaku #sunriseview #thelast6 #6ixwalks #etobicoke #humberbaypark #torontopfr #glowing #wintersun #nature_perfection #nature_lovers #natureshot #nature_sultans #macro_mood #moodynature #iphone6splus #iphoneonly #shotoniphone6splus

Good morning Toronto! . A slight departure from my typical coloured sunrises, here’s a moody sunrise to start your day. .

What time do I wake up for my sunrises? . This depends on two things: the season, and where I'm shooting. The sun rises much later in the winter (7:49am right now) and earlier in the summer. Depending on which park I head to, I'll wake up in time to be able to drive down there. I’ve woken up as early as 5am to go somewhere and as late as 6:50am to get to a nearby park. . Let’s break it down: If the sun rises at 7:45am, I want to be at the shooting location for at least 30min. before this time (sometime earlier) to capture blue hour and any colour that may be present that morning. . If I take into account a 10min. drive down to the closest park, and about 15min. from waking up to exiting the front door (I don’t eat breakfast beforehand), then that leaves me having to wake up at around 6:50am. If I want to give myself some buffer time for things like scraping off snow off the windshield, then I adjust accordingly. . If you ask me, this isn’t early compared to when I wake up for work on a weekday—6am on my gym days! . What time do you wake up every morning? . #thelast6 #torontoclx #6ixwalks #blogto #sunriseto #winterto #torontopfr #sunrise🌅 #winterwonderland #humberbay #etobicoke #moodynature #instanaturefriends #nature_brilliance #nature_sultans #natureart #naturepic #opcmag #narcitytoronto #seetorontonow #explorecanada #travelon #nikonca #earthpix . #torontosunriseseriesbytaku

I want to try something different in 2018. . Throughout 2017 I’ve been asked many questions about photography ranging from “what camera should I buy” to “what’s your settings” and anything in between. Rather than answering them one by one, I’ll be sharing these answers to you through my feed in hopes that others will benefit from them as well. . That being said, if you have any questions you are dying to find answers to, please feel free to DM me and I’ll try my best to get them answered on my feed. . Rather than this being a one-way Q&A though, I’m also curious about what all of you think of the question at hand, so I invite all of you to participate in answering the question too, or continue on the conversation by commenting about the topic or on my response. . Sound good? Let me know what you think of this idea!

The New Year’s Day sunrise proved to be quite cloudy and cold. It was too cloudy on the horizon for the sun to peak through—but because of the wind and cold, I saw a few funnel clouds forming in the distance. This may not seem like much but it was moving and turning quickly making this look thinner than it really was. . There will be plenty more sunrises for 2018!

It was supposedly -31 degrees Celsius this morning, but I honestly couldn’t tell as I was mesmerized by the beautiful sunrise in front of me. . This is my final #torontosunriseseriesbytaku post for 2017 and I’m immensely thankful for each and every one of you who has come to enjoy my photos. If I was able to inspire just one person to get outside and enjoy nature, then I’m happy. . I hope 2018 brings in new challenges, hope, and happiness to each and every one of you. . I will be sure to continue on with my sunrise series that has given me a chance to meet new people and experience new adventures. .
