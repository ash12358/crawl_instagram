👻 Thank you @kin.home for the @studioarhoj ghost 👻 This little ghost is joining the most beautiful of Kin’s Studio Arhoj pen pots (or clean brush pots!) that @jordan_ish gave me for my birthday !!! Asparagus Fern (& grey pot) & String of Pearls from @isherwoodandco and I’m keeping them alive and well 🤓  I’m really excited to be doing more signpainting over the next few weeks - more for @ampersand_projects & for @kin.home! Thanks for the opportunities 🤩

Second lot of signpainting this week for @ampersand_projects - but different project! This is for Good Game, I was commissioned by artist Anna Horton-Cremin & project manager Matt Andrews. Good Game is a new project that explores the positive impact games can have on our lives, communities and the places where we live. Tomorrow they are running a workshop which is open to all; Saturday 7 July, 12 - 4pm, Thimblemill Library, Bearwood, B67 5RJ ‘Play, remix and design games about living Bearwood and Smethwick in a hands on creative workshop. Drop-in, no need to book. Adults can join in too!’ I made a really fun isometric logo for the project as well (not pictured!)

I was invited to be part of the group exhibition FORWARD at @designfestbrum which took place a fortnight ago across Birmingham. It’s up at @medicinebirmingham right now! This is the blurb I wrote for the programme... “How will design shape the future? Greener living and sustainability will become weaved even further into the fabric of the design industry; I think we'll see more people who simply won't work on projects detrimental to the environment. We have a choice (*checking my privilege here*) but generally we can choose who we help with our time and skills. The quote is an adapted version of Einstein's 'Look deep into nature and you'll understand everything better'. Plants improve concentration and productivity, reduce stress, and for many people increase overall happiness. So whilst I was thinking about design and designers as a collective power to help the environment... this design also serves as a reminder to take a break once in a while and go outside.” (Or buy house plants...!) ✅

*not my signpainting*. I had a wander around Bearwood this afternoon, in advance of an upcoming project that @ampersand_projects have commissioned me for. Matt recommended I take a look at the signpainting in the Indoor Market. Before I got there I saw these signs for the Desi Sweet Centre - what a treat for the eyes too! All the signs pictured have been painted by a sign-writer called Richard, he’s 86 and ‘paints for beer money’, I didn’t meet Richard but hope to (and will take along @seven9signs & @brums_ghost_signs !!) EIGHTY SIX!!!!

This morning I went along with @isherwoodandco who was buying armfuls of beautiful flowers for her midsummer floral crown workshop at @artefactprojects tomorrow night (7-9pm and places still available - book through Jordan’s website!). I’ll be there 👋. I really liked the look of these green chrysanths that open up pink 😍. Today is officially the last day of Spring!

Day 5. Happy twirls, 1999! I remember at the time thinking this photo was DISGUSTING because I had a ‘massive belly’. Oh little Kezza, don’t you worry about that 💛 #powerbrows #happytwirls #pedalpushers #forgottotakeaphototoday #haveyoumutedmeyet

Rosie, Posie, Glitter Girls - 1998. Our group reformed as Gardening Club or ‘GC’ for short. Seed collecting, plant sales and organising things... I haven’t changed in 20 years !! Also - kernel seeds were popcorn kernels, surprisingly enough they didn’t grow into popcorn plants. 🌻

Day 3. Back to wearing comfort / sack skirt today (read: I needed pockets) but I’m carrying a huge vase of beauty from @isherwoodandco, which she made especially for the film screening that I put on this evening. Lots of joy! Gushing about my lovely friends and the brilliant community we are in! CAN YOU DIG THIS (chosen by Annabel) is about gardening as a transformative power - and sunflowers make a frequent appearance in the film. Sunflowers, long meadow grass and sorrel. The latter two picked from my allotment - Jordan is so clever. Thank you so much @in_sta_bel, @isherwoodandco, and @deecee_p, @alanatea & @laurabeane for all your help this evening (& @mollyrhoda for the cake!) total dream team.

Taking a leaf out of my lovely friend @fionacu’s book and celebrating what I look like. I’ve a lifetime of self image issues so this feels pretty bold! But Fi’s inspired me to bring out clothes I very rarely wear and dress fancy for a bog standard week day. Dress COS (eBay), necklace Oliver Bonas. Big hair and boobs (normally hidden under a big sack dress) all my own 💁🏼‍♀️ #happytwirls

This is a really cute thing, I’ll be there (of course!!) come and join us and celebrate the longest day of the year 🌸💜 we’re hanging out in @artefactprojects’s dedicated coworking and workshop space. #Repost @isherwoodandco with @get_repost ・・・ I’ve been warming up my flower crown skills for flower crown season (weddings & festival time) and thought it’d be super nice to share how to make your own with you! I have always loved how the Scandi’s wear a fresh flower crown to celebrate Midsummer, so decided it would be the perfect evening to do it on! The workshop starts at 7pm, and you are welcome to stay right up til Sunset drinking wine with us (though I’ll be on the water🤰PARTAY!) Details all on our website (link in bio) BRING ALL YOUR FRIENDS! 👯‍♀️👯‍♀️ Also if you didn’t already hear, we’ll be at #cocomad2018 making flower crowns & holding some child friendly flower crown workshops! More details about that soon 🌺🌼🌸🌻 p.s I am in love with the poster my lovely friend and brilliant Graphic Designer ‘knocked up’ for us. If you need some work doing, absolutely contact her!  @k_eslie

A story about this rose! I got this rose bush at Rose & Dave’s wedding in Derbyshire in 2013. Potted roses were used to decorate the venue and guests were invited to take a pot away with them. Their wedding was so much fun - the Destroyers played! I was a plus one and had never actually met the couple before the wedding. The wedding was held in a village hall and we had cycled to it from Matlock - and we cycled back with the rose in tow, along with all of our camping stuff. Last year at Stirchley Community Market I got chatting to a lovely woman, and as we were talking she mentioned where her husband used to work, then I realised it was ROSE! At SCM! How lovely. Anyway, that’s my rose bedtime story 👵🏻 good memories. Na night! #hazelwellallotments #folkandstory #flowersgivemepower

On Friday 15th June me and @in_sta_bel are screening CAN YOU DIG THIS (produced by John Legend) at Stirchley Baths. Loaf (@mollyrhoda) is making cakes for the event and there’ll be good coffee and tea, all donations for these, and profits from ticket sales, will go towards the work done locally by @northfieldecocentre, a local charity that inspires communities to take positive action. It’s £5pp, but if that’s a financial barrier to attending then please let me know. Doors are at 6.45pm for a 7pm start. Tickets are via eventbrite and I’ve put a link in my profile. Disclaimer: I didn’t make this poster, and I can’t find who to credit, but it’s so great! 🌻

Plant swap 2-5pm at @artefactprojects today - and lovely @isherwoodandco has donated cacti and fittonia. I’m taking spider plants, purple sprouting broccoli, courgette and what I suspect is a sedum of some description (jelly bean plant?). There will be indoor and outdoor plants, edibles and inedibles. @dalehipkiss is looking after the swap 🌿 I’ve made nice signs 💖

Last year @isherwoodandco had bunches of these beautiful ‘honeymoon’ frilly tulips at @stirchleycommunitymarket. I’d never seen them before! They are so unusual 😍 opening up even more as they bloom. I planted these as bulbs in October and six months later I’ve picked a few to bring the outside joy into my flat. #hazelwellallotments
