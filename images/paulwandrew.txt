I haven’t been posting much during our summer vacation with the kids. But this pic of Sam from our dinner at Lucali in Brooklyn pretty much sums up how it’s going.

The end of an era. One last night in this apartment after 5 great years. The longest I’ve lived anywhere in my adult life. Thank you Father, this place was a blessing. Ready for our new home!

Had a blast teaching with Andi at our second LiveLab for our Multiply course tonight. Over 30 students from 8 Liberty communities including our upcoming @libertychurchlondon plant joining from around the world. It’s a six month program with online curriculum and LiveLabs helping people exploring the calling to ministry, planting and pastoring.

One of the highlights of last night’s All Team Gathering was getting some of our Elders to pray over Jonny & Tasha Pettman who are stepping out to plant @libertychurchlondon. After a very encouraging residency in NYC we are believing with them for breakthrough and favor as they move to London this August and begin laying the groundwork to launch perhaps as soon as Fall 2019. Proud of you @jonnypettman & @tashapettman and standing with you as you step out in faith! #london

Discipleship conversation with Jesse & Zeke this morning: the story of Job. We read it together and talked about what it means to trust God even in tough times, the heart of God, having friends who give bad advice, why bad things happen to good people, how tests are a chance to discover what you really believe. And we wrestled with things that are hard about Job’s story, like the fact that he had more kids later doesn’t take away the grief for the kids he lost. I love walking this stuff out with my boys. We don’t need to sugarcoat the hard stuff for our kids. They need a faith strong enough to handle pain, mystery, suffering, disappointment and trials. Jesus is worth it. So are they.

Pastors & leaders in the greater NYC area... DM me for details if you’d like to join us... . We’d love for you to RSVP and join us for our next Meet Up happening this Thursday, May 31, in Downtown Manhattan. These Meet Ups are working lunches where we can gather, network and learn. I’m excited to announce that we’ll be joined by Drew Hyun, an inspiring church planting pioneer who has led Hope Church NYC to have a tremendous impact across the city. Drew will be sharing about his personal journey as a pastor & planter and how that’s led to the family of churches he oversees today. He’ll also give some insight into why they’re approaching church the way they are instead of more traditional models like a single, larger congregation. I think we’ll all learn a lot and there will be time for Q&A also. All pastors and leaders are welcome to join whether you are connected to ARC or not.

She loves fiercely, gives selflessly, and pursues Jesus relentlessly. A mother through and through. She’s worthy of honor and I stand in awe of her since she’s even more breathtaking in every way the more you get to know her. Happy Mother’s Day my love.

Being a controlling leader doesn’t create loyalty. Yes, people might leave if you lead with an open hand. But they’d already left in their hearts anyway. You can deeply value people and what they bring to the table, and respect their ability to hear from God for themselves, at the same time. In fact, I’m not sure you really value people (besides what they do for you) if you don’t trust them to follow Jesus.

Today is Mum and Dad’s wedding anniversary. I miss her all the time. Grief is a slippery thing to wrestle with but I’m glad to have loved deeply even though it hurts deeply that she’s gone. There’s so much to celebrate about her life & legacy, and their decades of faithful marriage, and I love them both greatly.

Our Manzini team are INCREDIBLE. Couldn’t be more excited about what’s happening at the Community Centre and @libertychurchmanzini. Refreshed and inspired and ready to fly home to NYC:)

I’m going to miss these two cuties:) especially after the confusion that I’m “Pastor Paul” (pasta?) and Calon accidentally called me Pizza Paul 😂

What a treat to be with @libertychurchmanzini today and remind them that we are made to Multiply. I’m over the moon with the fruit we are seeing together in Swaziland... it’s a stunning move of God. What a day to be alive!

Big morning as we took Mum’s ashes to the Green-Wood Cemetery this morning. So grateful for resurrection life and eternity, and for those of us living out her legacy. I love you, Mum. The Tranquility Garden is the perfect place for us to remember you.

I love that she uses her freedom and her platform to elevate others. Grateful to be married to @andiandrew who I believe is an embodiment of so much of what #internationalwomensday is here to champion. Here’s to the unsung heroes.

About last night. I was quite literally brought to tears by our Conversation for Change on Race + Justice. The place was packed and truth & love were at work in us all. Thank you @ashabercrombie and @libertycitynyc for putting these nights together. I love that our community is becoming a safe place for challenging conversations and the ministry of reconciliation.

Congratulations to everyone who helped launch @libertychurchbayridge today! Our 8th Liberty community got off to a great start... running out of seats and even needing more bibles with so many people deciding to follow Jesus today. Well done @heathkirkendoll & @emkirkendoll and the Bay Ridge Team! Great days head

My Mum is among the millions welcoming Billy Graham into eternity today, their eternities changed by his compelling presentation of the good news in Christ. Thank you for your life, your integrity and your passion for the gospel. I hope to shake your hand on the other side. I can’t help but wonder how the course of my life, and even the existence of Liberty Church, could have been altered if my parents hadn’t opened the door to faith at your crusades decades ago. #billygraham

Last night’s All Team Gathering felt like a breakthrough moment. Over 200 of our NYC team members gathered in one place... praying, worshiping, honoring, being stirred with vision, and being reminded that our first and most constant commandment from Genesis to Revelation is to MULTIPLY. #allteam

Beyond excited about our first All Team Gathering of 2018 tonight. If you’re a part of any of our teams in NYC you won’t want to miss this pivotal night to set the direction of our church for the years ahead. 7pm at our Brooklyn venue - 29 Jay St, close to the subway and great places to hang out afterwards.

I’m expectant for the impact of our new series this month at Liberty called Sent. Jesus commissioned us all with the words “Therefore GO...”. But so many Christians don’t know what they are “there for” and they don’t go. Let’s live with a sense of sentness.

Liberty Church turns 7 this Sunday! And what better way to celebrate than each of our 7 communities bringing everyone they know to hear how much Jesus, and His church, love the one. I’m believing that MANY will find home!

Seven years ago TODAY was our first service at Liberty Church! This weekend we’ll celebrate with Vision Sunday at seven communities across four cities, as one church. That is nothing but the goodness of God.

I hope everyone who calls Liberty Church home is asking God what they should give in this year’s Legacy Offering.

Global Missions, Church Planting and Building Home. We’ve never been better placed as a local church to make a global impact. If you call Liberty Church home I encourage you to take the Legacy Offering to God in prayer and ask Him what your part is to play. We’re on the edge of something big. Let’s all have seed in this harvest!

Soul care. Last week I had a moment of wondering whether I was being like so many of us when we’re recovering from sickness... stopping the medicine and getting back to “normal” too fast, only to get sick again. Leaders: you need to take care of yourselves. Unhealthy leaders build unhealthy churches. There’s a reason why airlines tell us to fit our own oxygen masks before attending to others. Your well-being is your responsibility! And frankly for leaders there is just too much at stake NOT to stop and receive strength from the Lord, especially when you’ve taken some hits.

As many of you know my beautiful Mum passed away last Friday after more than a year-long battle with cancer. The outpouring of love & honor for her through text messages, email and social media over the last few days since she went to be with Jesus has been stunning, and a testimony to the impact her life has had. . If you would like to join us in honoring my Mum, Jenny Andrew, we are holding a memorial this coming Sunday, Nov 26th at 2-3pm at 29 Jay Street in Brooklyn. We have a limited childcare program in place for younger children during the service. . In honor of Mum we’ve set up the Jenny Andrew Memorial Fund and all proceeds will go towards our community work in Manzini, Swaziland that she was so passionate about. Anyone who would like to can give a gift in her honor to those in need at https://libertychurch.com/giving/ and choose her fund from the drop-down list after you click ‘give now’. . We hope you can join us this Sunday.

Today I want to honor my incredible father who loved and supported my Mum with his every breath. He’s always been a great husband but somehow he took it to another level this last year as she walked with joy, hope and faith through a journey with cancer. Yesterday she went to be with Jesus. ... Dad, thank you for your example. I love you. Thank you for being faithful and loving, and for meaning it when you said “until death do us part”.

There’s something deeply reassuring about the rhythm of returning to His word. Let’s never neglect our source and strength. We need you, Lord.

It’s been a tough week for my Mum but it meant to world to have her sister Sylvia visit from Australia. Thanks for all the prayers from around the world. They’re carrying Mum and our family as we believe for miracles.

Everywhere we go it's the same... Liberty Church is a community, not just a crowd. It's breathtaking to watch the very same vision and values be outworked beautifully in a Swazi context.

The gospel is good news for the poor and God's word is life for every area including our finances. Praying that my message today in Manzini will cause many to experience more of the Father's goodness as they walk with him.

Don't even bother trying to box God. I spent years smugly writing off things like flags and dancing in the Spirit. Yet this moment at She Is Free was beautiful and dripping with God's tangible presence. So it's a good reminder for me that God refuses my boxes, labels and limits on Him. Don't be surprised if he uses things you considered "foolish" to confound you when you're "wise". There's a deep liberation in simply following the Spirit of God, moment to moment, and shedding all the baggage and agendas of yesterday's religion. He's eternally doing a new thing.
