Aggressive day: Ended with *magic*!! Continuing my year of epic magic shows. Joshua Jay (@joshuajaymagician) and his ::Six Impossible Things:: show was amazing! Small group in close quarters so you really get all up and personal with lots of audience participation!

::When Breath Becomes Air:: is an aubiographical book written by Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon turned writer who faced his own mortality when diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer at the age of 36. Kalanithi takes us on a journey of his life and his search for meaning through literature, science, medicine, health, and family. His writing turns medical procedures into lyrical prose, and his fascinating surgical anecdotes each end with new insights and perspective. As you approach the end of the book, you can tell he is racing to get each word down, to capture his last thoughts and memories for his daughter. Needless to say, this is quite the tearjerker (Bill Gates cried!). I managed to get through all but the posthumous epilogue by his wife without crying so good luck to the rest of you 😭 ..... #PaulKalanithi #whatimreading #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm @nypl

::Molly's Game:: (now a motion picture) is a memoir from a Colorado girl (hey!) who starts off as an abused secretary/indentured servant for a shady business man and eventually takes over his high-stakes poker game played by celebrities and the richest men of LA. (Apparently Tobey Maguire is a dick IRL.) Molly Bloom is smart, charming, determined, and a quick study. By paying attention to every detail of her clients, determining what makes them tick, and anticipating their desires, she built a complex network and expanded her poker empire to Vegas and New York where men lost millions of dollars at the bat of an eye. Through Bloom's perspective you get a second-hand high off of her adrenaline. It's not difficult to imagine how she got sucked into this underground world of extravagance and excess. When it all came crashing down, you feel as if there should be some moral to the story, like, "Don't do sketchy or illegal things." As much as you want to think she learned her lesson, you get the feeling she is just sorry she got caught. ♠️♥️♣️♦️💸 ..... #MollysGame #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm #whatimreading @nypl @immollybloom @mollysgamemovie @mollysgamebook

Tiffany Haddish is just as funny in ::The Last Black Unicorn:: as she is in her movies and any on-screen interviews. She is an unstoppable force of comedy now, but her memoir shows that her road to fame was anything but easy. Abandoned by her father and raised by a mentally ill mother, Haddish grew up in the foster system and then into a series of abusive relationships. She had to hustle at many unsavory jobs, including basically being a pimp, and then even once she found her calling it took years of hard work and perseverance to hone her stand-up comedy skills and navigate the male-dominated industry. As a young girl she was bullied for a wart on her forehead and called a "dirty unicorn", but through her memoir has shown us that she has transformed into something much greater.

Scriabin’s left handed nocturne (Op. 9, no. 2) kinda works out since my right wrist is still out of whack. Apparently Scriabin hurt his right hand intensely practicing piano and was told it would never recover. He then got really emo and composed a few dark pieces only for the left hand - but eventually regained use of his right hand again. He was also influenced by synesthesia and composed music based on colors. Overall he sounds like an intense and weird dude.

“Less talk More eat.” Couldn’t agree more! 🍣 Delicious 30-minute meal from Sushi on Jones II (@sushionjones) - except afterwards we realized we only received 10 out of the 12-piece omakase, since I took a pic of each one and this was all of them 😑 Still delicious though, fav was the wagyu topped with uni!

"The only easy day was yesterday." ::Living with a SEAL:: by Jesse Itzler (@the100mileman) is a hilarious read to brighten your day, whether you’re looking to up your fitness game or not. As told by Itzler, a sociable entrepreneur and avid long distance runner, he wanted to shake up his workout routine by inviting a REALLY intense Navy SEAL to live with him and train him for a month. Hilarity ensues. Every workout is chronicled, which are all beyond intense and grueling (100 pull-ups or 1,000 push-ups in a day; "burpee test, motherfucker"), but of course by the end we learn a lot of important life lessons that extend beyond fitness. While Itzler's lessons were different than mine, I learned 1.) the physical and mental limitations of humans knows no bounds, 2.) even crazy people make sense sometimes, and 3.) I am super out of shape. ..... #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm @nypl

::The White Tiger::, the debut novel of author Aravind Adiga, reads like it would be required high school reading (symbolism! magical realism! juxtaposition!), but one that students actually enjoy by the end. The novel follows Balram Halwai, a smart boy who grows up in impoverished rural India but was stripped away from education and forced to work menial jobs. He decides to become a chauffeur (and servant) to the landlords of the slums, and with access to the wealthy gains insight on how they live and operate. He moves with his masters to New Delhi and is exposed to even more corruption and greed, the disparity between the rich and the poor even more evident in the big city. Enter: commentary on social classes and globalization. As Balram learns more about the world, you feel his internal conflicts and see his scattered thoughts, going from an obedient servant willing to make every sacrifice for his family, to a dreamer who climbs the social ladder to rid his past, to a murderer-turned-ambitious entrepreneur. Much like real life, the main character is mostly a good person, but often does very shitty things. Yes, murder is obviously terrible, but by the end you come around to understand why he did what he did. Thank you for the recommendation, @mostlyfoodlin! It's no wonder this won the Booker Prize! ..... #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm @nypl

I had just binge watched Narcos on Netflix (@narcos @netflix), so I was intrigued when I randomly picked up this book and read the dust jacket. ::Lola:: by Melissa Scrivner Love is about a woman who built herself up to be the leader of a small gang in LA during an escalating drug war climate, trying to prove her worth to her community and to herself. This book was really hard to get into, and about halfway through I realized it was probably because a privileged white woman is trying to write about the hardships of being an impoverished, abused Latina woman amid a drug war. Unfortunately, her writing was not convincing and the plot was not interesting enough to distract from that fact. In conclusion, don't allow me to choose my own books, please send recommendations!! ..... #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm @nypl

We loved Donde José so much that we stalked José at his other spot, Fonda Lo Que Hay (@fondaloquehay)! More casual but equally delicious. I only understood maybe 5 words on the menu but still managed to order two amazing dishes. José himself prepared our dish!

OK so this may not be a critically acclaimed book or a literary masterpiece, but it is so cute and pretty hilarious. I saw this book ::Penguins with People Problems:: by Mary Laura Philpott on sale outside the Boulder Bookstore (@BoulderBookstore) and hadddd to buy it. The penguins are just so damn cute!! And they have problems just like you and me: bad breakups, work/life balance, self-esteem concerns, being awkward, etc. Totally relatable. Did I mention they're SO CUTE?! 🐧 There's also a tumblr account: therandompenguins.tumblr.com ..... Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl. Suspense and thrillers are my jam, as are cute animals. Recommendations welcomed! #books #read #reading #literature #bookstagram #bookworm #penguins

For an easy mystery read, check out ::The Couple Next Door:: by Shari Lapena. A couple who are new parents live their worst nightmare when their baby is kidnapped out of her crib while they are at a dinner party next door. A stoic detective investigates the couple and the people in their lives, and as secrets unravel, the truth comes out in the form of betrayal. .....

Picked up ::In the Woods:: by Tana French based on a recommendation from @mchaemer! A young boy is found in the woods with amnesia and blood in his shoes while his two childhood friends disappear, never to be found. Flash forward 20+ years later, the boy is a detective and is now on a case to solve the murder of a young girl in the same woods. The two cases are eerily connected, and the detective must revisit his past to reveal the answers to the current case. What will he discover?! I admit this book took me a bit to get into, about 150 pages until I really wanted to keep going. The well-written but exceedingly descriptive sentences were too long for my short attention span. But once the case started to pick up steam, so did my interest. ..... Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl.

::Before I Go To Sleep:: by S.J. Watson is about a woman who loses her memory after she goes to sleep each night, ever since a terrible accident 17+ years ago. "Is it like that movie 'Memento'?!" Instead of tattooing herself, Christine keeps track of her days in a journal that she keeps hidden from her husband, her caretaker, and secretly sees a doctor who is trying to help her recall her memories. Each day she uncovers more about her past and the accident, which leads to more questions and distrusting everyone. You start to wonder if she is trapped in a story someone else is tricking her into or if she is crazy and made everything up. A captivating read through the end, and makes you think about how memories define our lives. ..... Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl.

Read this because @mindykaling recommended it! ::Before the Fall:: by Noah Hawley. If you have a fear of flying, don't starting reading this on the plane like I did. The mystery starts off with a private jet being downed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with only two survivors, a failing artist who swims to shore with a young boy. Investigators dig deep into the lives of the passengers and crew in order to get to the bottom of the plane crash - Hawley tells compelling stories of each character and organically threads the narratives together as the truth is unraveled. .....

Slowing down on my reading goals... but finished up the last book of the Grisha Triology, ::Ruin and Rising:: by Leigh Bardugo, earlier in May! The ending is basically as you would expect, but there are some unexpected bumps and twists along the way. This trilogy is an easy young adult summer beach read. .....

Super excellent, unique, personalized, intimate speakeasy cocktail experience: two guests, one bartender in a makeshift bar which is actually a broom closet. Worth the trek to Bushwick to be able to brag about this for our 4th anniversary celebration. No documentation/social media so this entryway into a sketch alley is it. #NaVon

::Siege and Storm:: by Leigh Bardugo is the second book in the young adult fantasy series. After ::Shadow and Bone::, we follow the protagonists Alina and Mal on their reluctant return to save their country. They are captured by a pirate who betrays the evil Darkling, but he is actually a prince who is betrayed by the clueless throne and some kind of weird priest of a cult. All caught up? Let's see what happens in the third book! . Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl.

James Grippando's ::Most Dangerous Place:: is a crime fiction novel, the thirteenth book in a series that follow criminal defense attorney Jack Swyteck. This is the type of book you'd pick up at the airport for an easy read. Based off of a true-life case, Swyteck is defending the wife a longtime friend who is accused of murdering the man who raped her years ago. The book details a lot of legal proceedings which a lot of people may not find all that interesting, but the author is also a lawyer so that makes sense. There are a few twists and turns along the way, but the excitement only escalates towards the very end. . Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl.

I picked up Agatha Christie's 1939 mystery classic ::And Then There Were None:: not realizing that I had already read when it was still called ::Ten Little Indians::. I didn't remember what happened, so it all worked out! A whodunit mystery about ten people who are taken to a secluded mansion on an island when they all start dying/getting murdered by someone from within. Try and figure out who, but you probably won't until the big reveal. . Trying to read more after seeing IG #inspo, checked out some books from the @nypl.

::Eileen:: by Ottessa Moshfegh was actually the first book I read this year after I saw a Facebook post raving about it. The post inspired me to start reading more, but unfortunately the ending of this book left me annoyed with too many questions. Eileen is an awkward young woman with gross habits, an alcoholic father, and lives an otherwise mundane existence. She is unnoticed by society, until a vibrant woman who she develops a woman crush on waltzes in and upends her life. The whole book builds up to the startling event at the end, but then... that's kind of it. The author is a great writer with the deep character development of Eileen, but plot holes and unresolved endings just irk me. .
