24-hour road trip to pick cherries üçí off my in-laws tree and see relatives. Wish I could say it was a good trip, but at least the cherries are good! (My 5yo gets way carsick.

To quote Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off: Life moves pretty fast. If you don‚Äôt stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it. Or as I heard in the podcast I listened to while running, today I fed the good wolf. Alas, it‚Äôs the last Friday in June and the end of my fiscal year, so it‚Äôs the last Friday I have off to myself to use up vacation days. I will miss this freedom. . . . . #run #running #runner #trailrunning #trailrunner #trailrunningvegas #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun

I've felt a lot of anxiety, frustration, stress, anger, fatigue lately... but as I was out running this morning and came upon a view of #Vegas in the distance and I hear the song Good to be Alive by @davidrosalesmusic while listening to @ultrarunnerpodcast I truly felt that it was good to be alive at that moment. . I know in running they say you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable, but that's probably just applicable for all of life.  But I‚Äôm fortunate that I have vacation leave to burn up from work so I could go appreciate the world. . . . . #run #running #runner #trailrunning #trailrunner #trailrunningvegas #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun

I remember the first time I #voted and how exciting it felt. I was part of the process and expressing my voice! Now it feels less optimistic. There were a couple of governor candidates I had positive feelings towards, but still a lot of the process feels like picking the least bad option. Being registered as a specific party gives you the chance to vote in primaries, but party lines and platforms are so divisive it‚Äôs hard to pick a stance on issues from the cloud of arguments and grandstanding. But hey... go vote! #vegaslocal

I'm obsessed with being out here... but I enjoy it most when I know that I'm in the free and clear. Like today... the 5yo is at summer camp and I took a vacation day from work, so nobody is expecting anything from me, thus I thoroughly enjoyed my time. Nobody even messaged me on Slack during this üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ! (Bummer though, the elastic on one of my @Camelbak vest pockets broke and it makes it harder to keep the flask in there when it doesn't cinch down as much.

Could not figure out what day it was or why my alarm was going off this morning. But once it registered and I dragged myself up, I was glad I did this #run. I‚Äôve been frustrated this whole year, struggling with a never ending cough. It‚Äôs put an end to race plans, changed goals, etc. Then it seems like everyone is #running races and running them well. And I get asked all the time what my next race is and I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd like to feel better for several weeks before I consider that. Why I‚Äôm rambling now, I don‚Äôt know. I just have so much simmering beneath the surface I just have to vent something, I guess! #instarunner #motherrunner #stressedout #runningmama #runner I also started a #podcast at the end of this run. Give it a listen on jillwillrun.com #linkinprofile

No school today. Parent-teacher conference was done by 7:45am. We had a whole day to fill, just the #5yo and me. Donuts üç©, indoor playplace, lunch, #fusedbeadart, #paracordbracelet making, and watching Popples. It‚Äôs just barely 5pm. Is it bedtime yet? (For me...)

We went to SoCal for spring break. While it was fun, it was also exhausting. And I have zero wanderlust left right now. Traveling with a kid is hard. And with one who threw up 8 times due to carsickness during the trip is even more frustrating. Good to be home.

Avoided running in the wind, but the virtual course I picked to do on my @nordictrack with @ifit was all uphill at the beginning. Perhaps I should have looked at the profile, but I enjoyed the downhill on the 2nd half! PS - I love having a treadmill that does decline and virtual courses.

It‚Äôs been a bad #anxiety week and physically I‚Äôve felt beat down. But this morning I got out for a run in nature and it really lifted my spirits.

So #heartratetraining gives me more #anxiety than my regular life already does. I stopped in mile 2 to turn off HR alerts. If anyone has success stories, I'd love to hear them.

My use of Strava basically extends to auto-posting my runs on the platform. Sometimes I will go make little edits, and I do remove myself from leaderboards when I do virtual run courses on my treadmill. But the other day I posted this statement as a description to a run and I'll reiterate it here... . Running by heart rate is disheartening. . It's kind of a downer to slow down. And it makes me want to make my entire Strava profile private, which I'm constantly tempted to do anyway. I worry that people will see my runs that are a 1 to 1:30 minute per mile slower pace and judge me... but really, I need to hide my results from myself because I'm probably judging myself harsher than anyone else. . On a positive note... I really like these @tascperformance shorts I purchased from REI clearance recently. They had two prints in the clearance sale, but only one in my size. I'd buy more pairs of these! . . . . #run #running #runner #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun #runnermom #runhappy #running4real

We had lentil pasta from @moderntablemeals for dinner tonight. Higher in protein than traditional pasta! My husband liked it, said he wouldn‚Äôt have known it was any different if he hadn‚Äôt seen it pre-cooked, since it has a reddish color. The 5yo didn‚Äôt eat it, because she won‚Äôt touch pasta!

I took a week off due to bronchitis. I ran today. Did the 5K route that is part of the @runnersworldmag running festival virtually on my treadmill (@nordictrack and @ifit, they're the best thing for treadmill running ever!) I ran by heart rate, took it easy... and have been coughing ever since.

Yesterday‚Äôs #Runch Break. I think I‚Äôm going to try heart rate training in 2018. My HR spikes so high some days when running. I‚Äôm sure stress contributes to that.

My alarm went off and I almost just drifted back to sleep. What was the point? My running is so aimless these days, I have no goals or races on the horizon.

I wanted to run. Or nap. Or bum on the couch and watch a movie. But I was working... so I wrapped some things up and took an early #runch break. Back at the desk for a webinar.

The weather outside is nice... yet I keep running inside. I'm turning into a hermit. I can respond to work things easier if my #runch break is right there where I work.

I grew sweet potatoes this year. üç† I grew ridiculously large sweet potatoes and I grew a lot of them. I roasted two whole sheet pans of them today to go in lunches. That barely scratched the surface of what I harvested. I‚Äôm thinking I might dehydrate some and grind them into a powder to add to smoothies and oatmeal. One sweet potato is literally as big as my head and took forever to dig it loose. This was my first year attempting these, it was pretty successful! #vegas #garden #sweetpotato

Day 1: Yesterday I let my running streak die at 249 days. I left for work at 4am and got home around 10pm. My eyes were burning and twitching, I was mentally drained, I was physically exhausted. So I didn't run. I'm a little bummed my streak isn't still in tact, but honestly I'm also relieved. Now if I have a day where I need some #restdaybrags I won't feel guilty taking it. Of course, it also seems to have zapped my motivation as I had no interest in running today. . . . . #run #running #runner #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun #runnermom #runhappy #ihavearunnersbody #sweatpink #iamempowered #running4real

Today's run felt blah. I was probably dehydrated still from yesterday. I'm tired of the summer heat, I'm tired of mental and emotional stress, I'm just tired in general. But I ran until my watch battery died and called it good enough.

My toe was hurting while running a few days ago, then a giant bruise showed up. It feels like my toe has a pulse. I wouldn't call it flat out pain now, just uncomfortable. But I'm definitely trying to minimize the impact some while keeping my #runstreak alive. (Still don't know why I'm streaking, but I know quitting will make me feel bad, unless it's for a really good reason.) . . . . #run #running #runner #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun #runnermom #runhappy #ihavearunnersbody #sweatpink #iamempowered #running4real

This kid of mine turns 5 today. It seems strange that many years can go by so quickly, yet there are days you feel you've aged years in just 30 minutes.

I haven't run more than 6 miles in a couple of months and that's okay. I'll ramp my distance back up when it's time. The temps are starting to cool a little (again... a sunrise run with temps in the 70's) and fall will be here before long. For now, I'm just running to be happy. Or trying to be happy in the face of challenges. Or trying to not be miserable.

This Zim's Max Freeze has been my best friend lately. I got a massage on Monday and it was horribly painful. Massage shouldn't be that painful. . During the massage the pain was pretty intense, but I kept telling myself that it was doing me some good. It was working out all the knots that had built up from all the stress/tension I hold and from running. But within 30 minutes there were already dark purple spots showing up on my skin and they've only gotten worse as the days have gone by. #moreontheblog #linkinprofile . . . . #run #running #runner #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun #runnermom #runhappy #ihavearunnersbody #sweatpink #iamempowered #running4real

The #4yo wanted a new app. I told her I'd already bought her an app this week and if she wanted another she'd have to earn it. She left the room and returned with these. She said I could use them to buy the app. When I asked where they came from, she nonchalantly shrugged and said "one of my piggy banks." #AwesomeA

Yesterday I ran around London using @ifit on my @nordictrack 2450. Today, I ran around my neighborhood. Options are nice.

I need more sleep... it was hard to get moving today. I blame my cute #4yo for depriving me of sleep! However, I'm just not motivated, so I'm taking June a little easier.

Who knew treadmill running could be so fun? Ran in Palm Springs w/ @EvanDollard & Samoa on my new @nordictrack 2450. . The Palm Canyon course had us stopping to do some intervals with weights. The Samoa course actually exported with the map when I imported it to my @Garmin. If I didn't have to work, I would have played around with another course. . . . #run #running #runner #instarunner #runstagram #iloverunning #motherrunner #runnersofinstagram #runningmom #justrun #runnermom #runhappy #ihavearunnersbody #sweatpink #iamempowered #running4real

The daily mile done. This week hasn't had a lot of miles. I've had a hectic schedule, but there are always times like that in life. I'll live to run a lot another week! Or month...

I'm beat. I can't tell anymore if I'm sick, have allergies, thyroid symptoms, or what's going on. I'm just tired of feeling crummy. Today I ran shorter mileage instead of a long run.
