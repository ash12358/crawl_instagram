The ABCs are among the most important things our children will learn when they're young, and the good news is that they're something that families can very easily help children learn. But how should you teach kids the ABCs? Where should you begin and when should you start? What kinds of supplies do you need?¬† How much time do you need? Really, it's pretty simple, friend. So put away those workbooks and worksheets. Cast aside the worry and stress. As part of an ongoing partnership with @KinderCare Learning Centers, I've got you covered. It's actually very easy--and fun--to reach your kids the letters of the alphabet.

Quick! Head over to @washingtonpost to grab these two high-interest reads for your kids!

Have you or your kids played Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom while in @waltdisneyworld ?? It‚Äôs kind of like a scavenger hunt through the parks, using cards and casting spells. Anyone can play, and cards are free. Pick up a pack each day on Main Street near the Chamber of Commerce. Any hints from experts out there? Let me know!
