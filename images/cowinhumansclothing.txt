19th Century craftsmanship on display at Bahia Palace, which means brilliance in Arabic. Great place to visit and escape the street hustlers in #Marrakech #Morocco. We were told by a handful of them that the palace was either closed or they know they "right way" to get there. 😩

🇫🇷 What's a trip to Paris without visiting a work of art by my favourite architect, I.M. Peh. The #Louvre is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by the Chinese-American architect and completed in 1989, becoming a landmark of #Paris ever since.

🇫🇷 So much to learn, absorb and be inspired by here at @cannes_lions as part of the crew from @ogilvymather Singapore. So I found out that 96% of submissions do not win anything at this creative festival, so kudos to those who picked up anything from a shortlist to a Grand Prix! And best of luck to everybody who's still waiting for results in the coming days left. 👊🏼 #YesWeCannes

To get to a remote section of a beach in #Taiwan I sat on one of the weirdest vehicle I've ever come across. It's an off-road "carnival" tractor which sits 25, runs on tracks and crawls over anything. #TravelBravely

Namaste bitches! & happy international yoga day. Practicing #yoga for the first time in my life at the @lululemon #theimmersionjava was a truly mind blowing experience. Was able to do a couple of assisted handstands and headstands 😅 Made only possible with the company of really positive and awesome people from the Asia Pacific. Don't worry you won't be seeing me posing in tights or doing poses on this feed hahaha This shot was taken on the hill opposite the previous picture. [📷 @alicevanschaik]

🔍 We found a lost civilisation in #Yogyakarta #Java Like a scene straight out of an Indiana Jones movie, the ancient 9th Century #Borobudur Buddhist Temple was buried under volcanic ash and hidden for years before rediscovered in 1814.

Took awhile to wait for the crowds to clear. I can only imagine what it must have been like living here, the stories, the legends, the Chinese whispers, the treasures, the threat of assassins, the generations of rulers, their dynasties and world events which have taken place since 1420. #中国 #China #ForbiddenCity #imperialpalace

Once forbidden to enter, now frequented by commoners from all over the world. Once an imperial palace, now a place for us to reminisce the glorious days of old. This is my 2nd time visiting the #ForbiddenCity in #Beijing and I'm still blown away when the guide tells us countless stories and facts about this historical place. #中国

☁️🚐 Endless roads and beautiful skies. Next stop: Beijing > Singapore > Yogyakarta > Malaysia #Mongolia was an amazing experience except the fact that I suffered food poisoning at the end of the trip 😩 I am still clearing a backlog of photographs so it will be a non-stop hits of #Latergram pictures

[Pano 3/3, full pic on profile] At "only" 300m, these mountains of sand rest in front of a mountain range. It's said that the sand comes from the erosion of the rocks and terrain from the mountain. Maybe one day they will be of the same height. #pingfannie

(Pic 9) Strong winds are constantly hitting the #Sand #Dunes creating an ever evolving silhouette. The sand in the #Gobi is so fine it can find its way into places of clothing and electronic devices that even water can't. #Fact

(Pic 7) This #sand dune in the #Gobi #Mongolia was a proper bitch to climb. The strong winds were either trying to blind you or blow you off the edge to prevent you from reaching the top. But the short and intense climb was worth it! 😎 Like a high intensity workout of "mountain climbers".

🚴🏼 Taking a break on Bedok "Jetty", it's a nice long stretch of pedestrian path which extends out into the sea. Here, people fish, cycle, jog, spend the night in make shift shelters, hang out or bring a date. Large cargo vessels pepper the landscape in the background too, docking in the deep waters, waiting patiently for their next assignment. #Singapore 🇸🇬 #exploresingapore

Bridge over #RiverKwai - Getting some #perspective of the intense labour which went into building this black iron #bridge. It was built by the Allied POWS under the harsh supervision of the Japanese as part of the #DeathRailway linking #Thailand with Burma. Still in use today, the bridge was the target of frequent Allied bombing raids during World War II and was rebuild after the war ended. #kanchanaburi

880 kilometres. 14 hours of driving. Lots of chocolate. 1 episode of Big Bang Theory. And I'm only half way there at #Hatyai. 😅 This is my longest #overland to date. Doing all this to meet up with fellow #LandRover owners from around the world in North #Thailand for the annual #Rovernuts event! #LROS Special thanks to @Y5Buddysg for the roaming coverage on their "egg" which can connect up to 10 devices. It helps to keep the co-driver @fanniechua entertained! #Y5buddysg
