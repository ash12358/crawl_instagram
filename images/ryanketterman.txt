From the archives. Date is probably some time between 1999-2000. This is the Sunshine Skyway Bridge bathed in moonlight. Shot on 35mm transparency film. Tomorrow (May 9th) marks the 38th anniversary of the tragic accident that destroyed one span of the original bridge and 35 people lost their lives. I recall as a child driving over the remaining span with my family and being terrified. When the new bridge was built the flat portions of the original bridge were kept and turned into public access fishing piers.... from which this image was taken.

Had the pleasure of photographing this 1953 Porsche 356 recently for The Wall Street Journal. The owner had owned it in college, sold it, and while looking  for another one decades later, found the actual car he sold away. It was in disrepair and he restored it to its original condition.

Early-career location portrait. I barely remember what client this was for. Shot it on a #hasselblad, likely with #kodake100g transparency film. Strobe light running off a gas powered generator. Loud, clunky, slow.... but that film grain sure was nice.

The Main Street Bridge, back when it was a sort of greenish color. Shot on 35mm Kodak transparency film with my trusty #PentaxK1000 sometime around 1999-2000. It wasn't until the super bowl was coming to Jax that it was painted all sparkly blue.

The Dames Point Bridge. Shot on 35mm transparency film sometime between 1999-2001. Likely a 4-8 minute exposure, most of the night photography I did around this time I shot on #kodakE100vs (ISO 100) and #fujivelvia (ISO 50). There was no changing ISO to get the right exposure. You just had to expose longer.

Forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. We do not follow maps to buried treasure, and "X" never, ever marks the spot.

2017 has had an abundance of great times both personally and creatively. Getting to shoot a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral for Enterprise Florida ranks pretty high up there. This is the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that launched on January 20th, 2017. It was carrying a Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Satellite into orbit. We set up a remote sound-triggered camera at the launch pad and shot the launch manually from another location. All in all had 5 cameras pointing at it… which is a lot less than most of the guys that do these shots full time use. Happy New Year to you!

In an effort to provide aid those people that have lost everything in the recent hurricanes we’re hoping that you can join us in #GivingPhotography. We are going to be donating some framed prints. YOU can help by donating to a hurricane relief cause of your choice. The first person to donate a minimum of $150 or more will get this framed print. Details: * You must provide visual proof of your donation in a social media post or in the comments below. Use the hashtag #GivingPhotography * You must live in the greater Jacksonville area for delivery and/or be able to arrange for it to be picked up. * The print is 20x20” with a total framed size of 30x30”. * Originally valued at $250. * This image was used in art shows and the frame may show some small wear and tear, but it is in great condition. We recommend donating to www.bstrongdeliveringgood.org/bstrong or www.worldvision.org About this image: This image of the Jacksonville Beach Pier was taken sometime around 2004 as the construction of the pier was nearing completion. This pier was built to replace the previous wooden pier that had gotten destroyed during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. This image is a long exposure, created on color transparency film with a Hasselblad medium format camera. Being on film there is no metadata to provide details of the exposure, but I’m sure it was at least 4 minutes or more. The red color on the pilings is from red gelled strobes which I used to light paint. Thank you!

Post Irma: While I'm so sad to see all of the flooding around Jacksonville, Saint Augustine and other parts of the state I'm happy that what had looked like potential devastation to the gulf coast turned out not so bad. My family and friends there all came out unscathed. Thank God!

Family vacation photos are not the same with a drone. Some clever cropping and you'd think we were on our own private beach with no one else around. That would not be true, but good times nonetheless.

Seeing how it's officially winter now and Florida is stuck in eternal fall (I'm not complaining) here's a shot of Multnomah Falls in December a couple years back. It's just outside of Portland Oregon. If you haven't been, seriously put it on your bucket list. The place is gorgeous.

Savannah, GA #4thofjuly (2 of ?). Thought I had a really nice vantage lined up with the Talmadge Bridge (see previous post), but didn't realize they set the fireworks off on the unoccupied other side of the river. Really great show. Savannah does it nice. Those folks in the boat had the best seats in the house. #fireworks #savannahriver #visitsavannah #georgiaonmymind
