"Counseling isn't about making you more cowardly,  but about making you brave enough to face reality head-on & in a healthy way." - something my counselor is fond of saying. ‚Ä¢ We can spend so much time trying to get behaviors right, but don't make progress until we have the courage to face the inner stuff. I'm thankful for the people in my life who help me do that inner work. ‚Ä¢ I love what Suzanne Stabile says: "We all have solitary work to do that can't be done alone." #counseling #relationships

Sabbath is important. For me, refraining from social media, email, news consumption & most phone usage is a really important aspect of successful Sabbath rest/reset. // I actually switched from an iPhone to Android earlier this year almost exclusively so I could have this app hold me accountable. (Yes, I'm that weak. I need help). Every Friday morning (my Sabbath) my smartphone turns into a dumb phone. My soul is thankful for it.

Our Theology of Friendship matters! 1. You'll never get where God wants you to go in life without the right connections with other people. 2. Jesus taught that the love for one another exhibited in our friendships is supposed to cause others to take note & want to know the God we serve. (John 13:35)

HURRY is a drug for the soul. Its addictive in how it makes us feel important and meaningful. Over time though it impairs judgement and slowly kills. /// All your doing isn't what really gives you value. Just getting a lot done isnt what gives life meaning. \\\ REST is the antidote. Do more of it.

For much of my life I‚Äôve resisted the idea of really relying on other people and on God. Believing that the best and safest way to live was to try to be as independent and self sufficient as possible, I saw it as a sign of weakness when I had to trust and rely on the help of others. I saw it as failure if I couldn‚Äôt do it on my own. . Our need for outside help isn‚Äôt a bug in the system though, it‚Äôs a beautiful feature of being human... at leas if we allow it to be.

I‚Äôm just starting to run again regularly after almost two months of not running much at all. I took a break for a few reasons but the biggest reason was that it was starting to feel like something I HAD to do instead of something I LOVE to do. To be honest this is kind of a reoccurring theme in my life; not just running. I think it happens for two main reasons: 1. I LOVE setting goals. I love making strategic plans. This is good in so many ways but if I‚Äôm not careful I make so many plans and such aggressive goals around the things I care about the most that I‚Äôll turn things that brought joy into a real grind. I‚Äôve done this with my work and with my faith before. I was doing this with running. 2. I have a real tendency to attach my identity to WHAT I do instead of WHO I am. As silly as it sounds I really love not just running but being a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù. I like it when people introduce me and talk about me running marathons. This isn‚Äôt all bad. But when you start feeling like you‚Äôre doing something just to maintain an image it can be really bad. I realized I was starting to do that with running just as I have in other areas of life before. Anyway, taking a break has been really good and I think helpful for me. I ran this morning and enjoyed it in a way I‚Äôve not for quite a while. I think I‚Äôm back now. Hopefully in a more healthy way. #runyourworld #runchat #nuunlife

20 #marathontraining miles this morning. . I hate these runs... at least when I do them right. Running them 60s/mi slower than marathon pace always ends up more mentally & physically tough than it sounds. I often run them too fast because that feels better, but then I end up regretting it later. Today I stayed on pace though. #teamnuun #nuunlife #runyourworld

The decisions we make today determine the stories we will tell tomorrow. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I became a Christian 20 years ago this month. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The 15 year old version of me got talked into going on a church youth group retreat. Church wasn't really my thing back then but I agreed to go because there would be girls there. üòÇ That weekend ended up really changing things for me though. #TBT

If the 15year-old version of me ever saw me wearing this name tag he'd probably think it was a joke. Back then, I'd never have believed that God could/would do anything with someone like me. My shame & regrets would have counted me out. I'm thankful that Jesus rewrites our stories & redeems our past in ways we'd never have expected or planned. Today's going to be a great day!

So honored to get to be a part of this alongside such talented people! #Repost @fe.high „Éª„Éª„Éª "#lastnightatfe our guest panel answered questions on anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. We've committed to a process of raw and relevant conversations with tangible, human support for our students as we've positioned committed adults in each of their lives to navigate life's ups and downs. The most effective resources we can offer are our time, energy and intentionality to know each student's name and story. With this focused effort, we believe we can #stopsuicide from gaining further ground in our community. Thank you to our panel, the resources provided from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and for each and every student committing to make Loudoun County a safer place. If you submitted a question and it was not answered last night due to time constraints, please stay tuned as we will seek answers to your questions. While we concluded the series last night, the conversation has only begun. #mentalhealth #liveauthentic #13RW #mentalhealthawareness"

I used to think that training was the price I paid for the privilege of running races... (and it is) But more & more I'm seeing training as a privilege in and of itself.

Thankful that I get to run. Running 26.2 is always an experience. Today was 6th time racing 26.2 or beyond & it was no exception. Banged up my knee around mile 10 & had to fight through pain & the frustration of not running the race that I'd hoped to... I thought I might earn my first DNF but knew my daughters were waiting at the finish & I wanted them to see me finish strong so I kept with it. Finished. Earned another metal & another story. Good day. #RunWithTheMarines

Spent the last few days (and maybe a few more) here with the youngest as she battles a respiratory infection. The staff & facility are great...but feeling really ready to go home.

#TBT 3 years ago I knew @itsjasonbrown as just some guy who played, once a year, in our church lobby. Today, I'm so thankful to call him a friend & get to work alongside him day-in & day-out. I'm better off with him in my life.

Picked-up our morning coffee via boat like bosses. ...then we managed to get ourselves stuck on a sandbar (quite unlike a boss would do). üòñüòÅüò≥ There's a life lesson tucked in there somewhere. But for now, I just love that I get to do life with these guys.

Every "YES" we say has a "NO" attached. Saying YES to running marathons has so many awesome upsides, but also has a bunch of NOs attached. In the past, my wife & kids have received a lot of those NOs as I was logging hours & hours of runs. I'm trying to do it better this time. So today that meant saying NO to sleep & getting my workout done by 6AM so Nicki could get to yoga class & I could get to work on time. I'm still figuring it out, but trying... #findyourstrong #riseandgrind #onedayatatime

It's crazy how much impact a collection 10 songs can have on one's life. I bought Weezer's "blue album" in middle school & listened to it constantly throughout middle, high school & college... I wanted to dress just like them & probably still am infatuated with black-rimmed glasses because of them. They made being a nerd cool; which I really needed. ...the album turned 22years old yesterday. & I'm feeling really old!

Such a powerful message today. Now to try & live it out... ------ "God's power can't do much in the life of someone trying to convince others they're perfect, have it all together or 'not that bad.' It's in our vulnerability to admit our weaknesses that God is able to show himself strong & powerful. Admitting the truth about ourselves is the critical starting point for change." - Pastor @charliewhitlow -------- 2 Corinthians 12:9 But he said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ‚Äôs power may rest on me.

Seriously.  Do you really want your phone to vibrate every time I post a photo of my kids or some pic of my running shoes? Of course not! That'd be kind of weird... maybe even creepy. Nothing I post is THAT interesting. So, maybe Instagram is changing how their feed works, but it's not worth freaking out about. If you follow someone, you'll still see their posts. You just might have to scroll a little more. Your attention and focus are way too important to be interrupted by my random posts. So, please DO NOT turn on notifications. Have a great day.

It doesn't happen every single day for me, but the days that start with scripture & a run always seem to go better.
