I passed by the Halo Championships today too. They had Gears of War on the other side, but I’m not a Gears fan.  Got some swag. I watched a team called Tox win and people were like they were Optic and I understood them. I am slowly learning esports #halo #hcs #halo5 #nola #fps

Passed by the weigh in at Lakefront Arena where NOLA native Regis “Rougarou” Prograis is fighting tomorrow and it’s also going to be on ESPN. He is currently the interim WBC light welterweight champion #wbc #lightwelterweight #espn #toprank

Our plane took the super scenic route going south of the city and circling around then landing from Texas to MSY due to that storm. Now we’ve been waiting to get off board but planes were backed up. All I had was heat in Texas and back to rain in NOLA. #airport #storm #scenicroute

To the left is the CEO of twitch and next to him is 1 of the owners of Team Liquid. It was interesting to hear the thoughts of the future of esports from the Twitch CEO, not sure how much the future has changed since they have been bought by Amazon #collisionconf #twitch #teamliquid

Grandma's tomato bushes have grown so big. Just picked a whole box off. There's still so many more to pick. Got a picture of some Grandma had picked to ripen already. She got some strawberries that are almost ready too, I'm just slightly allergic though #grandmahouse #garden #tomatoes #greenthumb

Caught the dragon going off by the Harry Potter, Escape From Gringotts ride in Diagon Alley. I didn't really get this ride, because I found out it was from book 7 and I've only read the 1st book. Still fun, even though I enjoyed the Forbidden Journey ride more. I went on both a bunch of times. I am really hoping Star Wars land will be in a similar vein to what Universal has done with Harry Potter world. I am not even that big of a Harry Potter fan, but it was a great experience #universalstudios #harrypotter #escapefromgringotts #diagonalley

Over at Universal, Dr. Doom snuck up on me and scared me and this other lady lol. Got a picture of him later just walking around and sneaking up on people and no I did not go on the Dr. Doom ride. I wanted to keep my lunch that day, but I did go on that Spider-Man ride multiple times #universalstudios #drdoom #marvel #islandsofadventure

It's Star Wars Day so sharing my pic with Kylo Ren from right after the Star Wars Half Marathon about 2 weeks ago. Kylo was talking to all of us, too. Happy I finished early enough to get a picture with him. Just realized I got to go through the rest of these pictures I got like 200 lol. I look hobbled too I had ice on my hamstrings I took it off for the pictures though. Awesome experience #maythefourthbewithyou #maythe4thbewithyou #starwars #theforceawakens #kyloren #starwarshalfmarathon #disney #disneyworld #hamstringsonfire

Since Amazon had them on sale it was finally time to get a new wired mouse. I have no idea how old the razer to the left is. It still works barely. I like the new one, needed some more buttons and all the colors, going to have to turn that off at work though. Already set up my macros too. Will use this a lot more than my wireless mouse #razer #razerdeathadder #newmouse

I got home and see this huge box and I'm like what did I order. Why Amazon sent me this huge box for a laundry hamper? Then I found out the mailman delivered it. It probably took up half his truck.

Got what I wanted. I was worried about Mafia 3 being gone. I knew this would be a popular purchase, since it's based in NOLA. But really getting Lego Star Wars for $25 is awesome.

Kendrick Lamar, I saw him back when he was just K-Dot, things were completely different back then. Essence isn't the best venue for rap though. Still remember seeing Kanye at essence and feeling the same way #essencefest #kendricklamar

The heart rate for me during my run Sunday was pretty accurate from the Fitbit. I know people have issues with it. It also shows I need to get back in shape. Oh and I charged my Blaze for the first time this morning so it lasted 5 days as advertised. #Fitbit #FitbitBlaze #running #heartrate

My Fitbit blaze came in today. I like it. Still trying to figure out all the features. My step count is low today due to work and rain. This Sunday I have a race so I am looking forward to seeing how it performs. I look forward to seeing how my heart rate changes over time #Fitbit #FitbitBlaze

This is a picture from last weekend during "Endymion Saturday" at City Park looking at the ducks and towards downtown, but the weather today is almost the same. Feels like we're already in spring. At least that's what my allergies are telling me. #nola #citypark #neworleans

I just got another $100 amazon gift card due to my job's Fitbit program, which is awesome. But now I'm trying to decide on a new watch. I kind of want one that can track gps without the phone which the tom tom watch does, but I need to charge it everyday. The new Fitbit and the Apple Watch need the phone, but the Fitbit Blaze will last for 5 days. I'm leaning towards it now.

Caught a pic of Anthony Davis talking with Kendrick Perkins close to the end of the game. I think Perkins isn't injured, but he didn't play. I think he may have more energy than Asik though. Asik looked like he was struggling through most of the game. Oh this is the issue. Asik's salary this season is over 9 million while Perkins is under 1 mil and Alonzo Gee is a steal, he's only at 1.3 mil #nba #smoothiekingcenter #pelicans #neworleanspelicans #anthonydavis #kendrickperkins

I forgot I had taken all this pics of the monument. Grandma just walking toward the opening or the mountain gateway. I thought that was cool. The gateway is the "Mountain of Despair" and the back of statue which is seen in the background is the "Stone of Hope". Just realized that's why MLK is pointed away from it. Moving away from despair to hope or something like that.

Thought I should share this pic of the MLK statue while I'm at work. This is a cool angle, I remember it being packed. This was taken during my DC trip with Grandma a couple of years ago to visit my Uncle and cousin. I wish I was able to be off today so I could do some volunteer work. Too many deadlines.

I've been pretty lucky. Before Christmas my car overheated on the highway when I was dropping off a coworker at the airport. Stopped at an autoparts store and saw I had a crack in the overflow tank for the radiator. That's my poor job of resealing it at the top. My Grandpa actually criticized my mixture on Christmas lol. I took the scenic route to NOLA for Christmas out of fear of pressure building up to break the seal and overheating again. My uncle and cuz checked out the car on Christmas and pretty much all I had to do was replace the tank, and my cuz did that for me. At the time I wasn't sure if it was being caused by a bad water hose or water pump, or just bad radiator overall and yes I should have realized that the tank was getting towards end of life. When we took it out it was pretty brittle. The car has 117,000 miles on it so I am expecting things to break. But this car still runs better than a lot of new ones. #boredatwork #carfixed #overflowtank #radiator #suvgirl

So big wigs from my project and are in town this week and I have a team dinner tonight. But they all were surprised by how nice a view we have here. Some were saying they'd rather be down here than up in the northeast. I took this a couple of weeks ago. Random guy bench pressing on a tug boat. We see a lot of interesting things from our view.

These are used for cross country. But I got these for trail running and I can do regular running in them too. Plus they were cheap. They're actually really comfortable. I like more minimalistic tennis. I have a pair of vibram's too. I try to have at least 2 other pair of running shoes I can switch out so I don't wear down a pair quickly #nike #running #nikewaffle

My last 3 pair of my main running shoes. There's a common theme. My new ones are 4.0, but the last 2 were Nike free 5.0s. But the new ones feel like they have more cushioning. I beat up my last pair though. There's even a hole in them #nikefree #nike #running

So there was movie shooting happening right outside work. Got some pictures of Tom Cruise. I could have went to a lower floor but I was being lazy. I was told they are shooting Jack Reacher 2.

C-3PO and R2-D2 pic, while waiting in the queue for the Star Tours ride. So far I've only seen them in the intro for Battlefront though. And I played as a hero for the first time in multiplayer as Luke Skywalker. I forgot to record it though :-( #disneyworld #hollywoodstudios #starwars #startours #battlefront #c3po #r2d2 #xboxone

Took this picture as we were leaving the Star Tours ride of the AT-AT Walker in front of the entrance to the ride at Disney World. I thought today would be good to share this because of Battlefront. I played it a bit last night. You see the wall to the left that's supposed to be one of the new Star Wars attractions. I didn't see a date for it though. I really did enjoy the Star Tours ride. It's pretty cool. #disneyworld #hollywoodstudios #battlefront #starwars #atatwalker

The pup trying to demand my attention. He's just so cute. Over the weekend he discovered he is big enough to jump on the bed. Luckily he's already forgotten how. #puppy

Another Disney World pic from the Magic Kingdom night parade. I am going to make a scrap book of all the pics I took. Just I've been so busy with work stuff. We spent like a day and a half at magic kingdom #disneyworld #magickingdom

Got a light up harness that actually fits the pup for our evening walks.

Picture of stunt guys in France at Epcot. I took this on the Friday of our trip. We probably spent the most time in Epcot for food reasons :-). So I also wore my US soccer jersey on this day. Little did I know that the US women's team was playing against Brasil the next day in Orlando. I was noticing there were a lot of people speaking Portuguese. But this just helped me remember I'm going to see the World Cup winning women's soccer team play China at the Superdome in December. So excited #disneyworld #epcot #uswmnt #soccer

I bought a light up harness for Teto yesterday and found out it was way to big so I altered it a bit. It's actually on backwards but since it gets dark earlier now we walk/run at night and it makes him easy to see. I went and bought a smaller one today, but since it's storming right now I'll wait until tomorrow to try it out.

So got to see Ben Simmons play a bit. He's pretty good. He's a good passer, too. I guess that's why some people have been comparing him to Lebron. He never really took a shot outside the paint though.

Another Disney world purchase. I love the seagulls from "Finding Nemo" and it's good to have some comic relief at work. It was hard to find water bottles at the gift shops; so many coffee mugs and I don't drink coffee. #disneyworld #boredatwork

So I bought my puppy some socks. They were only on his feet for about a minute and that was only because I was distracting him.

I haven't been posting the vacation pics, because I've been sick since Saturday. I'm finally starting to feel better. But I bought this cute Studio Ghibli / Totoro bracelet at Japan in Epcot. It doesn't really match what I'm wearing to work, but it's still cute. #disneyworld

Since Halloween got moved to today. I took a long walk with Teto in his Halloween costume as a Rufferee lol. He was trick or treating too. The neighbors gave him so many doggy treats.

My pup Teto turned 2 months today. It's so hard to get pictures of him, when he's not asleep because he is constantly moving.
