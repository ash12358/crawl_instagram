See? Follow this podcast to be a part of the conversation. #safetyintheindustry Repost from @studio.c41 using @RepostRegramApp - Tomorrow‚Äôs episode is going to be a bit controversial.

Meet the woman behind the camera. She's loud, opinionated, stubborn and downright ugly sometimes. . . But, she's also compassionate, driven, dedicated and wears red hair like no one's business. ü§£ Hi üëã  I'm Julie. I run a safety group on Facebook named RISE (Respect, Integrity, Safety, Education) and I need YOU! I need (more) moderators who are willing to help with the group. The link to the group is in my profile - please JOIN even if you cannot moderate. Do you have a heart for this industry? Are you hoping to provide more education to photographers, filmmakers, stylists, assistants and models? That's great!! üôåüèª Please send an email with your availability to risegroup.contact@gmail.com Thank you! üíú #risegroup #modelsafety #safetyinphotography #photographersafety #modeleducation #photographereducation #redhairrocks #imfiery #butconcerned #imreadytofight #helpmehelpthisindustry #letsstopthecycle #nomorepredatorsallowed #thisisanindustryproblem #worldwideissue #notjustlocal

During any session or wedding, a skilled photographer should be able to choose exactly how to control the lighting. I love being able to have bright and airy images in the same location as dark and moody. Here‚Äôs a key: when shopping for a photographer, try to notice if they have images that check off different lighting skills. ‚úîÔ∏è outdoor images that are exposed appropriately and aren‚Äôt ‚Äúblown out‚Äù every time. (Also, are their clients squinting?) ‚úîÔ∏è indoor images that aren‚Äôt under exposed. A good photographer should know how to work a flash for all indoor events. (Flash should NOT look like cave lighting). I‚Äôve noticed over the years that some photographers do amazingly well when the sun is up but have no idea how to handle going indoors. Variety is KEY! Knowledge on how to handle ANY situation is key. Weddings are a big deal. Hire someone who will take it as seriously as you are. üôèüèª Yes, I am for hire. juliehuntermedia.com #juliehunterweddings #weddingphotography #weddingplanning #experiencematters #knowledgehelps #atlanta #chattanooga #nashville #familyphotography

Spent some time with an amazingly sweet family on Saturday celebrating a graduation from #columbiatheologicalseminary. Not only did the graduate revive this garden but she BUILT these water tanks to irrigate the soil. I love when people help create a better place on the earth. And not just for themselves. For the betterment of anyone who wanted to enjoy it. Faith in humanity restored for the day. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è . . . . . . juliehuntermedia.com #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterfamily #familyphotography #graduationpictures #celebrationofsuccess #sweetfamily #decaturga

I've had a really productive year! I got to shoot on #RED more than a couple of times, thanks to @dalefalkjr for the opportunities and @timdaust for the use of his cameras. I created a brand new company... @creativeroadmedia ... as well as moved from Atlanta to Chattanooga mid year. I think I had more clients this year than any year previous. I didn't do a great job of posting on social media but I aim to do better. Huge thanks to my #1 assistant, @gabbyphoto__ and please give her a follow, too. She's doing big things this year! There are so many beautiful weddings and portraits that I've taken but have been too busy to post. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this year!

Did you know that I'm a mom of four? Or that I recently relocated to the Chattanooga area from Atlanta? Or that I run a boudoir business : @atlantaboudoir , a photography business : @juliehunter that focuses on portraits and weddings and I also debuted a brand new full media production company : @creativeroadmedia this last summer? My middle name is hustle. If my eyes are open, I'm working. But, you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. I love the work I chose.

Me too. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm not sure if I feel sad because it's literally peppered all over my Facebook/twitter newsfeed or feel great about making a huge statement together to impact how the world views harassment, assault, rape, etc. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úä I'm *with* you. People are using the hashtag "#MeToo" on Twitter and Facebook to raise awareness about sexual assault and harassment. A post shared by actress Alyssa Milano explains that if people who have been sexually assaulted or harassed tweet "me too," it might "give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem." I never ask for anyone to copy/paste but if you feel led, this would be a good one. #sharethis #inspiringjulie

Silly photo of us but super successful wedding weekend. There are a TON of photos to go through but I'm crazy excited because it was definitely one of the sweetest, most beautiful weddings I've ever shot. I'm so thankful that I get to do this for a living. üòç And crazy thankful for my mini me who happens to be an amazing photographer as well. #juliehunterweddings #juliehuntermedia #weddingphotographer #roswellwedding #snapchatfilters #preweddingselfie #latergram cassistedbygabby

Who knows the real story about this building that neighbors @chattwhiskey? It's pretty cool to look inside the distillery and see where the bricks shifted.

It's #fabulousfemalesfriday !! About 2.5 years ago, I put a shout out looking for a back up makeup artist for a last minute #NaturallyBoudoir booking and @joshuawsims recommended @lintumarie and I don't think I've stopped using her. I wanted to give her a social shout as she is one of my favorite people to work with. I've had nothing but pleasant reviews from all of my clients (and a few repeat customers for both of us!). If you are looking for someone who knows what she is doing, please give her a call. https://www.gcmakeupandeffects.com/ Her website has ALL of her social media links - so be sure to follow her everywhere and refer her to anyone looking for anything from beauty to special effects. #empoweringwomen #independence #bestlittleMUAeastofthemississippi #notaremarkaboutherheight #butsheisshort #bookhertoday #assistedbygabby

I'm just discovering that I actually have shot quite a bit of family sessions that never make it into my social media. So, I might remedy that over the next few days and flood you with some sweet babies and cute families, if that's okay? This little one was born only five days ago, on August 13th. She's the daughter of my hubby's brother so I can safely say, you'll be seeing more of her as she grows. üòäüòâ #happybornday #freshfromtheoven #brandnew #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterphotography #jhpfamilies #juliehunterfamily #jhpnewbornsession #casualsession #myfavorite #layingonmylap

The talent that was brought to the table was incredibly amazing to witness. I cannot thank all of these people enough.

DON'T FORGET TO SWIPE LEFT FOR MORE. Over the last few months, our neighbouring building (the old Bank of America on Roswell Road) has been removed so I decided to put up a gopro camera to capture the progress.

This is the face of Alzheimer's. I visited with my Mom's family down in Dublin for Mother's Day but we also celebrated my grandmother's (we call her Big Mama) birthday. I wasn't fully equipped to film her as much as I wanted to but I did take several video clips and photos of her over the day. She's showing signs of alzheimer's disease. There were times that she was very engaged and knew who was talking to her and other times, she had to be told over and over who family members were. I know this is a hard time for my mother. We want our family members around for as long as we can have them. I feel very blessed that I've had my Big Mama all of this time and she's met and held all of my children. She's still with us but this is as difficult for her family as it is for her. üíú Happy 89th, Big Mama. ‚ù§Ô∏è #juliehuntermedia #alzheimers #alzheimersawareness #family #memories #inspiringjulie #grandmother #mothersday #birthday #atlantaphotographer #filmmaking #photojournalism

Black and white is one of my favorite ways to capture any session that utilizes soft or low lighting. It's also especially perfect with nude or implied nude photography.  #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterphotography #juliehuntermaternity #impliednude #fineartnude #blackandwhitephotography #maternityphotography #studioapg

Pregnancy is one of the most incredible experiences. There's really not the perfect words to describe what you feel, dream, eat and emote. You have almost no control over your hunger or your sleep. I'm a proud mom of four daughters and I had relatively easy pregnancies and deliveries. I was very blessed. Maternity sessions are one my favorite to do.

I don't do a lot of families but I really enjoy working with people who like to have fun at their session. I think it's extremely important to meet, get to know and enjoy your photographer's company prior to the big day so that you and your family can relax, enjoy themselves and get great images. #foodforthought #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterphotography #juliehunterfamilies #familysession #turnipseedfarms #fayetteville #funfamily #funphotographer #atlantaphotographer #assistedbygabby

Simple, sweet moments are what I love best during a maternity session. It doesn't hurt that the wind was helping us out on this day. Beautiful mom, too!

Tinkering with the 45mm tilt shift Canon lens from @aperturent this weekend under the guidance of @ostudios. Big thanks to model @sashafierce95 for letting us use her to practice on. She's a newer model to Atlanta and has a great look. Check her out.

Ok, it's my turn. One day, last month, I was doing my usual surfing on Facebook and saw this ad for this set of books pop up and I rarely click on or even less often actually purchase something via an ad on Facebook but there was something about these that spoke to me. In one month and two days, I will celebrate my first wedding anniversary with @atleast1graham and instead of naively thinking everything is perfect, I feel like I should be making an effort every single day for him and for us. When you dream for just the right person to enter your life and they finally do, you want to make sure that nothing changes that! So, we are reading these books together (he has the hubby version). I'm so excited and before I even read the first page, for the first day, I had already said a prayer for Graham today. It was definitely a sign. I encourage anyone in a relationship worth keeping to read these with your spouse. #31creativeways #happyhubbyhappylife #keepingmyman #mrsgrahamlansford @jeffersonbethke @alyssajoybethke

Yup!! This year we are giving away EIGHT free days! How's that, you ask? If you rent for three days and pick up today or tomorrow, you do not have to return until Tuesday, January 3rd!! Why? Because we are amazing! And, also, because we will be closed so you have to rent NOW! Our shelves are getting pretty empty. Take advantage of this amazing deal while you still have time. @Aperturent will be closed from December 24th-January 2nd.

Today marks my parents' 50th wedding anniversary. They have traveled together, worked in the ministry together, created a huge family (with just two kids!) and most importantly have stood by each other every time... Even when cancer came knocking at each of their doors. Mom and Dad met in October 1966 on a blind date and married in December. Mom said that my dad was very funny and always kept the family in stiches. Dad said that Mom was very shy and even brought her cousin along on the date. Over the years, life hasn't been easy but my parents have persevered and always together. I love you guys so much and cannot wait till we celebrate your love this evening!! üòçüë∞ü§µüéâüéÅ

#engagementphotos. Shooting through tall grass is one of my favorites; a smiling kiss is another. What luck when I realized I got both in one shot! #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterphotography #teamcanon #goldenhour #sunset #outdoorphotography #kennesawmountain

Another great example of the 200mm f/2.8L. It's a very sharp prime lens that delivers gorgeous images. Just wrapped up this sunset engagement shoot near Kennesaw Mountain and thought I'd share one of my favorites. #juliehuntermedia #juliehunterphotography #engagementphotos #kennesawmountain #sunset #goldenhour #aperturent #gearjulie #teamcanon @aperturent

So, one of my favorite things about working at @aperturent is helping customers decide what to #rent. One of my favorite lenses is the 200mm f/2.8. The sweet spot is your entire image, the #bokeh is amazing AND you cannot beat the price for an #lserieslens! I primarily shoot #boudoir these days and this last weekend, I spent some time with a friend from out of town. Not only is she a really amazing person and friend but she makes an awesome subject/model. My camera of choice for this session was playing around with the Canon 5D Mark IV. #juliehuntermedia #aperturent #teamcanon #redheadsdoitbetter #naturallyboudoir #studioapg #gearjulie

My sweet puppy, Pal whom I adopted from @releashatlanta a couple of months ago. He loves the water so much! He played all day at my parent's house. I caught him taking a rest under my dad's boat. Even though he's a mess, I might get this one printed! #juliehuntermedia #adoptdontshop #releashatlanta #puppies #labpuppy

It's the word no one ever wants to hear, #cancer. In late August, my dad was traveling home from Texas and because of severe pain, was admitted to the hospital where they misdiagnosed the symptoms for walking pneumonia. He was released with antibiotics after two days and then he made his way home. After getting rest but no relief, decided to go to the local VA. They quickly told him to go to the Atlanta VA ER. After a few scans, we heard, "there's a mass on your right lung." A biopsy is taken. You pray, you wait, you hope it is just an infection but they responded, "it's cancer." Yesterday, we found out that it's 5.2cm and located at the very bottom of his right lobe. "It's in a good position to be removed." We are praying for excellent results but we are human and scared and really hate the word cancer. My mom survived breast cancer in 2009 but she's not had a pain free day since. I appreciate everyone who's known about this and has given me & my family love, support and a shoulder to cry on. Surgery is slated for October 28th. Keep praying. <3 #cancersucks

You know, I'm not the young girl I used to be. I'm older, a little heavier, a little more wrinkly and my hair is definitely full of new grays every day. But, I'm healthy and I have a beautiful family and a really great career that I'm completely passionate about!! No hiding behind a filter today. I'm just very thankful for friends, family and the life I have. #gratitudepost

In Sept 2014, I did a session for Andrew & Stephanie Hinze in expectation of an adoption. Almost a year to the date of that session, I did a family session of their newly adopted son, Ethan.
