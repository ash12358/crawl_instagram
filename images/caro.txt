It was three months to the day since I‚Äôd been here to say goodbye to Caterpillar. Last night ‚Äî another Friday the 13th, I kid you not ‚Äî Minerva was rushed to @vergbrooklyn because she wasn‚Äôt eating, moving around, or looking particularly alert. She had anemia and a fever, plus the lingering effects of an intestinal parasite. She stayed overnight (I was there until almost 4AM) and will likely have to stay a second night, and I haven‚Äôt been able to shake the horrible memories of what it‚Äôs like to learn for the first time that nothing you can do will make your pet get better. Please send your prayers and positive energy to this feisty little devil. I want her to be chewing on my feet again in no time. #babypanther #blackcatlove #catstagram #catsofinstagram #catsofbrooklyn #blackcatsofinstagram #bombaycat

Evening colors last night.

I needed mezcal negronis and @evieraikh so much today because life is weird and sometimes you require the company of someone who has known you for 15 years. The photos we take now are only SLIGHTLY less awkward than the ones from Meatpacking nightclubs in the mid-2000s. #photobooth

Cats know good people when they meet them, but I have never seen a cat warm up to someone as quickly as Caterpillar did with my dad. The first time she met him back in the fall of 2012, she immediately jumped into his lap, catching him completely and hilariously off guard. So, yeah, he‚Äôs one of the good guys.

Celebrating the end of my residency at @TED, and the fact that I managed to not just make it through a very difficult three months but come out of it happier and more focused than I‚Äôve been in a long time, with a weekend of reading books and exploring weird old military stuff on @governorsisland.

Minerva enjoys a #sundayfunday of playing in breezy late-spring weather, accepting pets and snuggles from passing children, and getting a ton of pollen stuck in her fur.

Holy cow. That was intense, nerve-wracking, and a massive rollercoaster of an experience. My @ted talk about why advertising is broken was taped today as part of the Residency event, and even though there were no bad puns in it (sorry), I don‚Äôt think I messed it up too badly. The past couple of months have been some of the toughest in recent years, and I am so grateful to the TED family for placing their faith in me when I‚Äôm sure there were plenty of times when I really didn‚Äôt look like I could keep it together. My talk will be online in a few months so keep an eye out! #lifegoals #tedtalks #publicspeaking #advertising #worklife

So ‚Äî I threw out my back on Saturday morning while trying to do some speed work on the rowing machine. It was bad, like, the kind of bad where I had to crawl to the freezer to get an ice pack because I couldn‚Äôt stand up or walk. I‚Äôm eager to get back to being active (a weekend of being confined to my bed started to make me go crazy) so today I spent some time at two different clinics getting treatments that involved e-stim, k-tape, cryotherapy, and a saltwater float. Some combination of it really seems to have helped, but goodness knows what. And yes, it really was negative 206 degrees in there. #cryotherapy #sportsmedicine #biohacking #selfimprovement #formerathlete

A lazy Sunday for Minerva. She looks very learned and poised here but she was really just hanging out by the nearest food (chicken and sausage jambalaya) to see whether anyone would let her steal any bites. She was unsuccessful. #catsofbrooklyn #catstagram #catsofinstagram #blackcat #blackcatlove #blackcatsrule #babypanther #catswithbooks

I cannot even begin to describe how intensely obsessed Minerva is with figuring out how her automatic feeder works and making it dispense food at her command. (That is, until someone walks in with fish tacos or Shake Shack burgers and she forgets about the feeder and wants to eat the human food instead.) The automatic feeder was a decision made because we figured if she were fed a small amount multiple times throughout the day she‚Äôd stop rampaging through the kitchen trying to open any bag that smelled like it contained food. So far...sort of working? Suffice it to say I love this little bandit to bits already and am telling everyone about how smart she is.  #catstagram #catsofinstagram #blackcat #bombaycat #catsofbrooklyn #rescuecat #blackcatsrule #blackcatlove #babypanther

It‚Äôs Minerva‚Äôs first #caturday since she moved in!

So... I‚Äôd like you all to meet Minerva. She‚Äôs a native of Ft. Greene and like any proper 21st-century Brooklyn resident she loves succulents and yoga and brunch (or rather, she loves to eat anything at any time). Welcome home, little one. I was worried I wasn‚Äôt ready for you and honestly I still might not be, but as is often the case with cats, you‚Äôd made up your mind already. This house is full of love and positive energy and ear scratches for you and I‚Äôm thankful that @catcafebk took such good care of you for the past few months.

Closing out @summit‚Äôs Tulum event with an open-air dinner that turned into a spontaneous Depeche Mode sing-along. I‚Äôve been going to Summit‚Äôs events for almost ten years and I will remember this weekend as one of my favorites even though I no longer party until 4AM covered in glowsticks like you probably would‚Äôve seen me doing circa 2011. Good vibes and cosmic connections abound.

The weather is finally warm, the Manhattan skyline dazzles from across the river, and my sweet Spats has come over for dinner ‚Äî yes, that‚Äôs really Spats! He just has a different neighborhood dinner agenda these days. Thank you @stellanni for getting me out of the apartment on such a difficult day and surrounding me with cat love from friends old and new. Caterpillar‚Äôs love and legacy live on in all of us.

Caterpillar left this world on a beautiful spring day, the kind of weather that was her favorite because it meant lazy sunshine naps in the backyard. Her last minutes were full of hugs, headbutts, and noisy purring, but there was a weariness that had never been there before and I knew she was ready to go. I told her that I will always love her and assured her that wherever she is going, the neighbors‚Äô creepy cat will never be able to find her.

It‚Äôs cancer. My perfect, beautiful Caterpillar has a malignant esophageal tumor and in the absolute best-case scenario, she‚Äôs looking at six months of chemo to maybe put her into remission. Worst-case, I will be saying goodbye to her next week. She‚Äôs only eight years old and I‚Äôm not ready for this. I feel bad for every vacation I ever took that separated me from her. I wish I‚Äôd taken more pictures of her. I‚Äôm sorry I ever got annoyed when she wanted to jump on my shoulders every day after I came home from work. Caterpillar has been my light and spirit for the past six years, and a part of me is already gone.

Three visits to the vet, a dozen mostly unsuccessful attempts to make her take pills, and yet this little love bug still trusts me with belly rubs (and insists on them). She seems to be on the mend and has made it clear that she only gets horribly sick when I‚Äôve been traveling, so clearly I‚Äôm never allowed to leave her again. #catsofinstagram #catstagram #russianblue #catlove #bellyrubs #crazycatlady

One of the (many) paintings decides to throw shade at some guests at last night‚Äôs @placeinvaders dinner with chef @luisguayaba.

This is Otis, who lives at the @kittea_sf cat cafe. This is the face he makes when he knows you have treats in your hand. Then he does this thing where he jumps up on his hind legs, grabs your hand with his front paws, and pulls it down so he can get the treats. He‚Äôs an assertive little furball who knows what he wants and luckily is cute enough to get it pretty much every time. 10/10 for type-A purrsonality. #catsofinstagram #catstagram #catcafe #catsofsanfrancisco #catsoftheworld #sanfrancisco

Happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day and happy 65th birthday to my dad! I can credit him for my loves of garage rock, trashy sci-fi movies, bloody NYC history (thank god The Alienist ditched that red herring plot line because otherwise TNT would have been getting very angry messages from multiple McCarthys), and classic American heritage fashion (e.g. plaid shirts). Dad, thank you for taking me to concerts I was too young to get into on my own and in turn for dragging me along to murder sites, graveyards, and Philly mobster courtroom hearings that you thought would be ‚Äúculturally significant,‚Äù because in retrospect now I have the best stories. You taught me how to embrace the crazy and channel it into intellectual inquiry because there is nothing too weird to produce meaning, how to adopt a sense of amusing irony and detachment in the face of stuffy high culture, and how to keep the faith that ultimately the good guys will win. (NB: Harvard still sucks.)

When you receive an invitation to hang out and drink champagne in the largest living room in NYC, you clear your calendar.

For a lot of my friends and colleagues in the industry, 2008 was our first time attending #SXSW and this past weekend, 10 years later, we felt quite a bit of nostalgia for the era of Pete Wentz haircuts and trashy ‚Äúgoing out tops.‚Äù For me, though, as a lifelong uncool kid it was thrilling to be able to walk into any party (that in itself was a shock) and know that I‚Äôd be among friends. The nostalgia of vintage SXSW, I‚Äôm convinced, is rooted in the fact that it seemed as though for one weekend a year we had our own pop-up city where we all could feel like we belonged and nobody judged us if we made asses of ourselves. Those days are long gone, and I‚Äôm sure we annoyed the locals plenty anyway. But it makes me understand why so many of us keep going back even though it‚Äôs now expensive, sprawling, and dominated by huge companies. The trees are still full of opinionated Texas birds and the cheap neon lights still line streets packed with downtown bars, and sometimes the stirring of memory is enough. #nostalgia #keepaustinweird #throwback

So my oddest #SXSW experience was when I went to a party where there were puppies to play with. But a cat showed up just for me, because cats follow me everywhere. (Her name is Pearl and she‚Äôs a regular.) #catsfollowmeeverywhere #catstagram #catsofinstagram #catsofaustin #crazycatlady

Shortest haircut in a decade, and it‚Äôs even shorter in the back. I figure that I‚Äôm going to be giving a TED talk in a few months (I am!

This is the face of a horrified and confused little cat who was just bathed with my favorite expensive chamomile face wash because I was out of cat shampoo and she had a bit of a fur emergency that involved getting soaked in beer after knocking a pint off a table.

I have been trying these out a few times a month to ease muscle tension, especially when I have been traveling a lot and my body‚Äôs thrown off from too much time in the air and stuffed into plane seats. (They‚Äôre apparently also good for seasonal depression, and I think I‚Äôm seeing some results from that but I‚Äôm not sure. I also don‚Äôt know if I buy into all the ‚Äúdetox‚Äù claims. The muscle benefits are super obvious though.) Higher Dose is the trendy brand these days but I prefer @chillspacenyc, which from my experience is more organized and makes it easier to fit an appointment in midday ‚Äî only downside is that they‚Äôre in midtown. #wellness #infraredsauna #travelhacks #frequentflyer

I loved the color contrast (and the weird fish and boat on the wall) inside the waiting room at the ferry port at Moyogalpa ‚Äî where you catch the boat from Ometepe to mainland Nicaragua. Lack of symmetry precludes it from being anointed with the #accidentalwesanderson hashtag, but it‚Äôs close. #colorcontrast #nofilter #interiorporn #moyogalpa #ometepe #nicaragua #colorsoftheworld

Volc√°n Maderas (4,573‚Äô), last night as the sun was setting over Santo Domingo beach on Ometepe. (Those are clouds, not smoke ‚Äî the volcano is dormant.) We climbed to the summit today and while we wound up covered in mud and unable to get any decent views in thanks to the cloud cover, it was nevertheless worth it for the adorable baby howler monkey we got to see on the descent. üêí #nicaragua #ometepe #sunset #sunsetporn #hiking #volcano #volcanmaderas #girlswhohike #adventuretime #optoutside

Took the ferry to Isla Ometepe in Lago de Nicaragua for a jungle volcano hike on our last day here. I was trying to take a photo of this church out of the window of our taxi, thought I‚Äôd missed the window to do so because we were moving, and didn‚Äôt even realize there was someone sitting on the steps. #nicaragua #ometepe #churchphotography #iglesiacatolica #accidentalphoto #churchesoftheworld

Sunset beach vibes in San Juan del Sur. It‚Äôs already a haven for party-friendly backpackers and a lot of the businesses are expat-owned, so it‚Äôs certainly lost some of its ‚Äúauthenticity,‚Äù but it‚Äôs nevertheless refreshing to go to a beach town where the shoreline hasn‚Äôt been carved up and privatized into resorts that keep visitors totally isolated from the rhythms of local life. Hope it stays this way. #travelinspiration #sunset #sunsetporn #nicaragua #sanjuandelsur #pacificcoast #beachlife #viewsfordays #wanderlust #tropicalvibes

The view from the Cristo de la Misericordia statue overlooking San Juan del Sur and the bay. It‚Äôs the seventh tallest Jesus statue in the world (the famous one in Brazil is fourth) and when you‚Äôre the son of God you apparently are entitled to some very good views.

That feeling when you realize that less than a week ago you were watching the sun set at 9000 feet over snowy mountains in Utah, and now here you are on the Pacific coast in Nicaragua and the same sun is putting on a whole different production for you. And all those years of hard work really show why they have been (and still are) worth it. #sunset #sunsetporn #nicaragua #sanjuandelsur #travel #travelgram #globalnomads #girlsborntotravel #wanderlust #whereitravel #beachsunset

We just arrived in San Juan del Sur for a slightly-longer-than-a-long-weekend getaway and I was lying on the hammock on the porch admiring the view when a cat showed up, meowing and asking for scratches. This seems to happen, well, pretty much everywhere I go. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a secret society for greeting crazy cat ladies and making them feel welcome in every corner of the world. #catsofinstagram #catstagram #catsoftheworld #nicaragua #sanjuandelsur #pinkandgreen #crazycatlady #travelingcat #catsofnicaragua #adventurecats #globalnomads

The #lensflare outtake from last night‚Äôs sunset. Being in the mountains is always very regenerative for me, and part of that is because (especially as a New Yorker) I consider it an exercise in maintaining a slower pace ‚Äî in this case, I sat outside in the cold for about 45 minutes watching the sun set, waiting for clouds to give way to a full spectrum of reds and oranges, taking in the full panorama of last light reflecting on snow. You can find natural beauty just about anywhere but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to go somewhere that you know you‚Äôll have it thrown headlong at you in its most vivid form if you‚Äôre willing to put in some time (and elevation). #lifelessons #sunset #sunsetporn #utah #lifeelevated #instamountains #greatsaltlake #viewsfordays #discovertheroad #americanwest #lastlight #mountainsunset #powdermountain #greatoutdoors #slowliving #wasatchmountains #instagood #mindfulness #mountainvibes #iphone8plus

I‚Äôm flying to LA this morning for a week at our main office and a shock transition to 70-degree weather that I‚Äôm sure my immune system will adore. What an amazing time we had at #sundance2018! Thanks to @utopianlvh for facilitating the rental of our Sundance HQ (the estate we booked is called Endless View ‚Äî I wonder why) and taking care of all our crazy requests. We highly recommend them for corporate events, retreats, or any other situation where you need more assistance and coordination than you would get from an Airbnb or VRBO rental ‚Äî this made it possible for @lislefrieddd and me to channel our efforts elsewhere, like decorating the house with bright turquoise foxes everywhere. #worklife #businesstravel #sundance #parkcity #deervalley #instamountain #utah #lifeelevated

Ski day after a successful #sundance2018 and @brandstorytelling.tv weekend! This is my first time skiing in way too long so it‚Äôs perfect prep for next weekend at @summitpowdermountain.

My secret to a booze-free Sundance (trust me, it is not easy) has been the non-alcoholic hot toddy made with @curiouselixirs Curious No. 1, in case that wasn‚Äôt clear from all the Instagram love I‚Äôve been giving them. Here is the never-before-printed recipe, as concocted by @katiesmithadair of private dining rockstars @placeinvaders: 1 part ginger syrup (not simple syrup ‚Äî just ginger and water reduced), 2 parts cinnamon simple syrup, and 3 parts each of Curious and chai tea. It totally made my night, but then I ruined a whole lot of other people‚Äôs nights because we then went to TAO and everyone had to see that my dance moves are even worse when I haven‚Äôt been drinking. #sundance #sundance2018 #flyingdry #dryjanuary #soberlife #apresski #hottoddy #mocktail #deervalley #parkcity #fuzzyboots

In between the cold, the 7500 feet of elevation, the hills, and the fact that I haven‚Äôt been running regularly since July, daily workouts at Sundance have been pretty brutal but I am so pumped that I‚Äôve gotten them in each day so far. Why did it take so long for me to realize that traveling to festivals and conferences for work is so much more manageable when you aren‚Äôt partying nonstop? #worktravel #sundance2018 #utah #healthytravel #wellness #girlswhorun #flyingdry #instamountains #outdoorwomen #deervalley #parkcity

She‚Äôs back! Caterpillar‚Äôs holiday vacation in NJ was extended thanks to the #bombcyclone, and until today I hadn‚Äôt seen her since Christmas. I missed her terribly.

Went to @catcafebk because I miss Caterpillar so much right now ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt seen her since Christmas because she‚Äôs been staying with my family outside the city, and the ‚Äúbomb cyclone‚Äù got in the way of my ability to pick her up last week.

Six days and counting without alcohol as part of @curiouselixirs‚Äô #flyingdry challenge, and the biggest difference is SLEEP. I hadn‚Äôt realized how even just small amounts of wine get in the way of a full night of sleep. I track it with a @nokiahealth Aura sensor ‚Äî I highly recommend this ‚Äî and I‚Äôm getting higher-quality sleep with virtually no insomnia, waking up naturally between 6 and 6:15 AM. This is the worst thing ever because I love wine, but I am trying to replace my ‚Äúred wine and trashy political gossip reading‚Äù evening hours with healthier activities. Today it was a visit to the infrared sauna at @higher.dose (I am skeptical of anything that claims to ‚Äúdetox‚Äù but have heard legit stuff about it being helpful for people who get seasonal blues) and then my favorite extremely messy but potent DIY mask (in case you‚Äôre interested: equal parts bentonite, charcoal, ACV, rose water, and honey). Now it‚Äôs back to trashy political gossip because I have Fire and Fury on my Kindle, and I almost don‚Äôt even notice the lack of red wine. Almost. #nomakeup #dryjanuary #selfie #selfimprovement #healthylifestyle #wellness #magicalthinking #smughashtags

I‚Äôm going alcohol-free for the month of January with the help of my friends at @curiouselixirs, with two goals: one, to rebuild a fitness base that hasn‚Äôt felt like it‚Äôs really there for a few years; and two, as a personal musing on ritual, habit, and the religion-like breed of magical thinking that seems to underpin self-improvement goals for yuppie millennials. If that sounds pretentious, let me just add that this evening on the trip back from DC to NYC I got very frustrated when I realized I couldn‚Äôt have my customary end-of-the-weekend crappy train wine, and so I obviously have to feel like this is something loftier than a dumb and super-basic resolution that I‚Äôll probably break when I get bored. Anybody else doing #dryjanuary? Holler at me and we can commiserate. #flyingdry #resolution #goalsetting #selfimprovement #shakennotslurred

My #2017bestnine is a little bit underwhelming because my two most popular photos weren‚Äôt squares, but here we go from top to bottom, left to right: Debuting formal pants at @themorganlibrary‚Äôs winter gala; the solar eclipse over Scott‚Äôs Bluff, NE (not visible in the grid); a bison in front of Devil‚Äôs Tower, WY at sunset; the afterparty for my fourth half marathon of the year in Cordova, AK; kisses from my perfect Caterpillar; sneaking into the library at the University Club in Manhattan; throwing shade at the @frickcollection Spring Garden Party; meeting a sweet fluffy kitten in order to reunite her with a family from Syria who had had to leave her behind; and lounging at the @aflyoungpatrons Astronomer‚Äôs Ball. It was a fun, crazy year. 2018 is going to be a little bit lighter on the champagne (I‚Äôm quitting drinking entirely until I‚Äôve rebuilt a competitive rather than recreational fitness base, which probably means no booze until April or so) and ideally heavier on the fitness pics as a result, but I can absolutely promise you more cats. #nye2017 #catsofinstagram #historicpreservation #girlsborntotravel

This English cat cafe is FANCY! It‚Äôs full of Scottish folds and Siamese and Snow Bengals ‚Äî my neighborhood cat cafe in Brooklyn (@catcafebk) literally gets its cats off the streets. The lovely team at @londoncatvillage told me that sadly the local shelters haven‚Äôt warmed up to the idea of working with a cat cafe, or otherwise the cafe would be open to it. Rather fitting that the cat cafes in the Queen‚Äôs domain are for posh kitties whereas ours back home are for upwardly mobile street cats looking to charm their way into forever homes.

The #polaris @united international business class lounge at ORD is spacious, calming, has loads of power outlets, and takes light fixtures very seriously (which is also the case on their planes ‚Äî when I got to fly on a Polaris-configured plane in March I marveled at the fact that my seat had sconce lighting. Somebody who works for United really likes lamps). Also, the ubiquitous food is very high-quality ‚Äî better than the Lufthansa lounges in Germany, which are my main non-US benchmark, as well as the Virgin lounge at JFK and the AmEx lounge at SFO ‚Äî and the bartender carded me, which was an extremely nice touch. There‚Äôs also seated a la carte dining, which I‚Äôm probably not going to check out because I do not need to be eating that much, but I did see someone being served a burger and fries that looked excellent. Also the windows are so close to adjacent gates that I could wave to the pilots if I wanted to (should I or is that weird?) #frequentflyer #airportlife #dreampolaris #airportlounge #businessclass #luxurytravel #mileagerun #staralliance

It‚Äôs time for a Christmas adventure: taking my ‚Äúkid‚Äù brother, who was born on Christmas so he kind of got shafted for life on presents, to London for his 27th birthday ‚Äî I am SO EXCITED because he doesn‚Äôt get to travel much and we have a packed itinerary of obscure museums and creepy cemeteries. (And as a bonus this is also a year-end frequent flyer trek of my own since I‚Äôm a hair away from @united 1K.) First stop is Classified, the fancy hidden restaurant at EWR that‚Äôs accessed from behind the kitchen of another restaurant and where they even give you chocolate after dinner. Next stop: ORD for the night. #travel #travelgram #airportstyle #staralliance #upintheair #jetsetter #frequentflyer #airportlife #cocktails #mixology #girlsborntotravel #luxurytravel

I‚Äôm now sufficiently old and cranky that I don‚Äôt want to wear skirts in cold weather if I don‚Äôt have to, so here is my glorious new midnight-blue velvet pantsuit from last night.

Rather #thankful that at this moment in time I get to be drinking a hot cider with bourbon in the tavern in an allegedly haunted inn (the oldest parts of the building were built in 1773).

If you are a closet or not-so-closet fancier of spires and gargoyles, secret societies, and learning where Bob Mueller partied in college, then this is the coffee table book for you! I am excited to have been part of the team that helped out historian Clifford Zink on his new book about the history and architecture of the @princeton_university clubs along Prospect Avenue in Princeton, and if you want to get the book before it‚Äôs available for sale on Amazon, you should check out the December 2 walking tour that @hsofp will be hosting (link in bio).

Head of the Charles is one of my favorite weekends of the year, and this year the weather and conditions couldn‚Äôt have been better. The boat pictured here isn‚Äôt mine, but another one from our @princeton_university alumni squad ‚Äî you can spot the alternating orange and black shirts from pretty much a mile away. My boat placed 14th out of 22nd, which is pretty good when you consider that 1) none of us had rowed together before Friday, 2) we had about two months‚Äô notice that our entry was confirmed so I‚Äôm pretty sure we could‚Äôve used a bit more time to train, and 3) two of the women in our boat have given birth in the past six months.

Hard to believe that the beautiful Whitman College at @princeton_university was built less than a decade ago. I remember going to its dedication in 2011 and hearing Meg Whitman talk about how difficult it was to find stonemasons capable of this kind of building. Clearly it was worth it - now, on a breezy and unseasonably warm Saturday afternoon, there‚Äôs something very timeless and grounded and meditative to it all. #architecture #collegiategothic #ivyleague #cloisters

Took Caterpillar to #StFrancisDay at Grace Church so that she can be absolved of all her kitty sins. She was incredibly well-behaved in spite of the fact that she was in a church with about 50 dogs, a half dozen other cats, and a rabbit. That was one very, very, very patient priest. #brooklynheights #catstagram #catsofinstagram #crazycatlady #sundayservice

It's a basic tenet of cat guardianship that the moment you buy a new set of expensive white sheets, your perfect and obedient little feline who has never coughed up a single hairball on the bed in the five years she's lived with you will suddenly start doing it ad nauseam (pun intended). Thanks @thelaundress for helping to deal with Caterpillar's bad habits. #caturday #catstagram #catsofinstagram #russianblue #catshaming #homeimprovement

Parker From Next Door scares the living daylights out of Caterpillar, and I haven't been able to figure out why, considering all he does is spy on us once or twice a day very calmly and doesn't seem to be aggressive in any way. We're talking banshee screams and fits of hysteria so bad that tonight as I was trying to comfort Caterpillar she took a rather bloody slice out of my right ankle. I will never really understand cats. #ghostcat #catpolitics #catstagram #catsofinstagram #brooklynheights

Six inches sliced off the rats' nest that lives on top of my head. Thanks to @soonbeautylab -- they've been cutting my hair for 10 years ever since I was getting black pixie cuts in their old East Village salon that felt like the inside of a mid-'00s pop-punk album. Now I'm old so I live in Brooklyn and get highlights in their millennial-pink-and-palm-leaf-print Carroll Gardens salon. #growingup #haircut #peakbrooklyn #selfie

My #travelstyle game is pretty much dominated by head-to-toe @everlane (with regular cameos by @cuyana, @thisisaday, and @mmlafleur). I love the wide-leg crop pants so much I bought 3 pairs in different colors. Also I swore I would never love rollerboards but @away changed things pretty quickly.

The downside to reorganizing my apartment and cleaning off surfaces is that Caterpillar thinks I did it all so that she can have new places to hang out and shed fur all over. But I'm fine with it because she's over her health scare, back to her normal cuddly self, and clearly is perfect and should be allowed to do whatever she wants. #noboundaries #catlady #catsofinstagram #catstagram #russianblue

It was another pretty scary day for Caterpillar: Two visits to two different vets, a sonogram that required belly-shaving, and blood work to see what's been making her sick. But not only did the sonogram turn up normal and healthy results, Caterpillar got her very first get-well-soon card in the mail!

Caterpillar's pancreatitis still hasn't been knocked out, and she might need a sonogram later this week to figure out why she's still in pain.

Real talk: My sneaky kitty Caterpillar weaseled out of the apartment this weekend while I was visiting my family and I FREAKED out. She was confirmed safely back home within an hour of her "disappearance," due in small part to the fact that she's lazy and really just wanted to lie outside in the backyard, and in much larger part to my friends and neighbors who let me know she was prowling around outside and got her back indoors. Huge thanks to all those who cared, pitched in, and even changed their evening plans to make sure she was safe. And thanks are also owed to my family for not disowning me when I started hyperventilating at the dinner table over a cat. Meanwhile I'm sure Caterpillar enjoyed her outdoor vacation and will be meowing nonstop until she's allowed back out... #üòª #catstagram #catsofinstagram #russianblue #crazycatlady #caturday

I've been doing some home tweaks and re-organizations this weekend and am continually inspired by the light, airy feel of last weekend's digs in the Hudson Valley (pictured here in a #throwback) because I think my room feels smaller and darker than it needs to. I'm convinced that switching to white sheets will do the trick (the current ones are charcoal-colored), although I may end up regretting it considering I have a gray cat who 1) loves to lounge around in bed, and 2) sheds a lot of fur. Thoughts? #homedecor #hudsonvalley #upstateny #catskills #catsofinstagram #catstagram #russianblue #neutrals

I really can't exaggerate how happy Caterpillar was to spend the weekend rolling in the grass and sniffing flowers upstate last weekend -- I'll have to take her back soon.

Gardens full of butterflies are Caterpillar's favorite places, but old houses full of books are a close second. #catswithbooks #catsofinstagram #catstagram #russianblue #instakitty #shelfie #shelfiesunday #oldhouses #historicplaces #hudsonvalley #upperrightusa #upstateny #catskills #thesecrethotel

Dinner tonight should be decent. Scent of thyme and soundtrack of falling water. #thesecrethotel #outdoordining #hudsonvalley #catskills #upstateny #upperrightusa #dinnerparty

Getting welcomed back home to Brooklyn by a friendly face, er, paint job. The #vanlife is taking @placeinvaders to Detroit tomorrow but for now they're gracing our cobblestone streets with their bright colors. #brooklyn #brooklynheights #travel #igtravel #lifeontheroad

And now I'm headed back to NYC. Big thanks to this guy, who suggested I visit Alaska in the first place and then was crazy enough to go along with my idea to run a half marathon in a remote fishing port (no bears were sighted). On to the next adventure...which will be a road trip with my cat this weekend. #travel #alaska #alaskarailroad #instamountains #traintravel #mountains #adventuretravel #igtravel #globalnomads #notallwhowanderarelost #caroacrossamerica

Spent a lot of time this week on the Alaska Marine Highway ferry between Whittier and Cordova. An insanely long ride (6 hours one-way) but some of the most beautiful, meditative scenery you could ask for (with some lucky glimpses of humpback whales). #alaska #instamountains #mountains #princewilliamsound #globalnomads #girlsborntotravel #adventuretravel #caroacrossamerica #notallwhowanderarelost

Post-Alaska Salmon Runs Half Marathon in Cordova, AK, where we seemed to be the only runners who *weren't* racing as part of some kind of challenge to run either a half or a full marathon in all 50 states. It seems to be a crazy subculture of mostly middle-aged and retired people that I did not know existed until this weekend. We met one woman in her 60s who started running at age 51 and now only has a Hawaii marathon left. PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. Also my knees hurt just thinking of that. #running #halfmarathon #womenwhorun #alaska #girlsborntotravel #caroacrossamerica
