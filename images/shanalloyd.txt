Three more weeks of Summer semester thank goodness. I'm wondering why I spent 15 hours studying genetics this week to teach 3rd graders. 😂 And I want ice cream now thanks to my shirt. #tgif

The sight of these beauties and return of my favorite golden light while photographing a gorgeous mama to be reminded me Summer is almost over, as is half the year! Managing a business while being in school full time has really reached a level of difficulty I hadn't expected. This semester is almost over and I just realized yesterday I get three weeks off until Fall semester starts, the one and only time I was excited about a mistake on the calendar 😂. Any hoot, I absolutely love this time of year...no matter how busy the last few weeks have been and will continue to be it truly is a blessing to be healthy & happy. 🌻 Hope everyone is having a great week!

A very special evening with our dear friend who will begin treatment for breast Cancer next week. We know our God is sovereign. Coming together to pray for her this evening I just know in my heart she will conquer this. We are so blessed to have our small group and thankful for the relationships we've made together in Christ. 🙏🐝 #godisgood #movemountains #prayersforhealing

7 hours on the computer today, 2 before that at the library and all I can say is, weekend me. Accept that I have a wedding on Saturday so....Sunday me? 😂 How about this view though? So thankful for those rare moments when I get to be still and take it all in.

One of the gifts of marriage was becoming an Aunt. We are both so proud of this sweet girl. Top of her class, intelligent, artistic and beautiful she embarks on her final year as a high school student and very bright future ahead...and she made her dress! 💙 Had so much fun taking her Senior Portraits today. We love you @_raccchhhel_ !

Truer words could not be spoken 😂 but seriously, let's talk about Friends. After months of feeling in my gut that I just have too much to stay connected to and with, so much news and updates on a daily basis, the noise is constant. In a moment of sheer desperation for quiet, I did the unthinkable and deleted my Facebook. Are you okay? Are you nuts? Well, yes. Ha. Nothing in this world should have such a grip on me, other than God. That is my short and simple answer. For my heart to remain focused on what is true and nourish myself and others it just had to be done. In my moments of silence, I've found so much clarity. I feel less weighted and able to serve in ways I couldn't before. I was spending so much of my time making sure people knew what I was doing instead of putting my best and full focus into the things I'm doing. Anyway, it's been a lot lately. But I am thankful for those consistent and always present relationships in my life who understand me even when I'm not always transparent about what I'm going through.❤ It some times takes a little crazy to have the courage to do things differently. I'm okay with that.

Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean. - John Muir Couldn't find any quotes about not washing your hair or shaving your legs 😜 Nature always nurtures me, from the inside out. It was good to slip away if even for a little bit. 🌲

Some things on the trail really make you think. I couldn't get over this little blonde baby staring at a bunch of horses asses. It reminded me of how I feel getting on Facebook and reading sometimes. 😂 Also, it's really okay to go against the grain. Take the trail or path less traveled and remind yourself often that it's okay to be the weird one. 💓 Best moment from today, then came the rains.

So thankful for the romantic I married, for his spontaneity and patience during all the many chapters of our life together. For helping me see what matters most in life and for dropping me off in the woods for a few days of calm when he knows I need it most.🙏 Started my day with an amazing solo hike now settling on the trail to do homework 🤓🌲 Miss you @tattoojohnaon!

Making an appearance this week finally! (Yarrow Cerise Queen, Loraine Sunshine Heliopsis & Cosmic Evolution Coreopsis) Only one heirloom perennial has not quite bloomed yet. Transplanting these babies and nourishing them for the last two months has been a joy but also stressful. I'm so glad they are flourishing in their new home after years of being cared for by my Mother in Law 🧡 Seeing them every morning is instant happy.

I've been thinking about Grams a lot this week so I'm looking forward to our Huffman Kitchen Club this evening, which I started in memory of her. But......I had no time to make anything today so I did exactly what she would have done. Bought a pie and put it in one of my pie dishes. Only difference is, I'm admitting I didn't make it. Something she would never do. 🍓 Love and miss you Grams. 🙏

Nom nom nom 😍 Someone I definitely do not mind working with this early in the morning, Husband. I'm so incredibly proud of this man, feel honored to be his wife. There's a lot of pressure in our society, to be a certain way, to conform and accept what's popular over what truly matters. I admire John so much for always being true to who he is and what his core beliefs are. He is one of the most sincere and humble people to have ever cross my path, for this I am so thankful. When I made the decision to walk away from my career and pursue something new and scary, he said go for it. When I felt a stir for  an even greater purpose, he prayed with me and together we started yet another journey. His love, encouragement and stewardship are unwavering. An amazing artist, who's main priority in his art is making his clientele happy, helping those around him, he serves daily. He's not in it to be a rockstar, or instafamous. Instead he is a light in every person's life that he meets. There is no greater influence. I believe the goodness he pours out into the world and his faith in God have made our life together so plentiful. I'm blessed that I too get to serve, by his side. It's the little things that sometimes are the biggest. I will never forget the first night we met and have cherished every day that has followed. Love you @tattoojohnaon, and so very proud of you!

When my Husband wants to know why there are so many new plants in the house, I'm blaming @tarebeartara and then 6 hours of studying about photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and chemiosmosis. Besides getting a 💯 on my Bio test warrants some new 🌿. Right? I'll never look at plants the same 👩‍🏫

Just drinking my energy for the day in this adorable mug from one of my beautiful brides with a reminder to stop, smile and breathe. In the midst of preparing for two of the biggest weddings of the year this weekend, I spent hours studying and taking tests, hours cleaning up our neighborhood, meetings and more. Hours hours hours for all the things with very few left in a day to just be. The few I had though, were spent wisely, with people I love. I took a challenge last week to reach out to people I truly care about but have lost touch with. In doing so I learned so much, some hard stuff, some great stuff. The type of things you could never learn on Facebook or other. I still have so many more to reach out to.  It's somewhat changed my perception on things, as have my continued studies. Things like connectivity and shifts in our culture that have redefined what we value and with less and less time to share, sharing it online seems less of a priority. Life is so different for so many of us, uniquely beautiful both in our hardships and triumphs. 🧡 And it is important to stop, smile, breathe and know it's ALL part of the journey. I feel so blessed to be a friend and part of many journeys as well as be on my own. Have a great weekend friends!

I'm intermittent fasting, just not with food. Instead social media 😂 but I left my stylist just a little while ago and well she's a gem. It was great to get a break from molecular science and talk about hair science 🤓 Not only do I feel amazing, but her presence was cathartic, her energy definitely transferred over to this lil ginger. 🧡 Back to my fasting, bu bye. Love ya @gypsy_rose_amber!

In an age of constant updates, we assume everything is good and we often forget the value in personal offline conversation. We see a highlight reel that often doesn't include the darkness, the struggles, the pain and we all have moments where a kind word from a friend can make all the difference. A friend of ours posted this on Facebook and its something I'm going to be doing all weekend despite our schedule, because it matters. "I'm challenging you to reach out to someone by 7:59 Sunday night that you haven't talked to in a while. Everyone has stuff going on. Ask about their stuff. You don't need a reason to randomly call someone, that's why it's random but I'm sure there is someone that you've been meaning to talk to. This is the weekend to reach out to them." We never know what a kind word and reaching out can do. Life is busy for all of us but let us never forget what matter most in life. We're in this together.

My official acceptance letter came today....in it an incredible SURPRISE! I knew my acceptance came with a huge cost savings already but today I learned that in addition to that, I've been awarded $42,570 in Scholarships & Grants, a total cost savings of $80K! 🙏🙏🙏 I literally SCREAMED. Sorry to my neighbors 😂 and thank you to my sweet Husband for the tshirt. ❤ God continues to move mountains in our lives. Though life is not perfect and there are many challenges still ahead, for right now I'm staying present in such an amazing blessing. #godissogood

There's a story so very few know, about a girl who lost her way. She struggled with so many things that happened to her and around her, learning quicker than most about the evil in this world and because of it never thought she would succeed at anything in life. But all the while her heartache was forming something beautiful inside. There was healing, there was peace and there was the greatest love for her waiting for her, when she was ready to forgive and finally move forward from the pain that held her back for so many years. There was grit. I'm counting every blessing as I wipe away tears of joy, learning today that my journey to my purpose will continue at the University of Dayton. Because I've overcome, I now have the gift of helping others to do the same. "In the process, in the waiting You're making melodies over me And Your presence is a promise For I am a pilgrim on a journey" #godissogood

I could have gotten the paint out of my hair first but that would mean I didn't wake up like this and I did. Oh naturale, sunkissed and freckled. I've been tempted to lift, pull, inject anything I can to intervene with the aging process but then I'll see a cool old broad full of spirit and life (with gray and wrinkles) and I'm like "that's going to be me" and I love that. I see so many imperfections when I look at myself but I'm starting to think that it's those imperfections that make us unique and beautiful. As long I have my brows and lashes, the rest can fall where it may. 😂 Cheers to growing old gracefully! #letitbe #almostforty

Excited for our summer program starting next week for our neighborhood kiddos! Such a fun way to work with children, get families together and play in the dirt. We donated our plot as a space to create and grow for our littles. Spent the afternoon getting it ready. 🌿 #forhuffman

8 hours of home work, two hours of leisure reading, grilling these smokey habanero legs and a bike ride. Layer in kisses and hugs from my favorite, avoiding my cell phone for a majority of today and I had myself a fabulous day off. Now for a fun night of organizing my closet 😂 #excitingtimes #summer

I don't know how I'm feeling good after two non stop days, weddings and yesterday being on my feet for 12 hours in 90 degrees. Maybe it's the constant laughter and fun, or who and what I come home too. Either way, feeling tremendously blessed and good. Appreciating the little things today, the small but significant things that matter most. 💕 Hope everyone has had a great weekend!

Just so we're clear, I'm fatter in person 😂 buttttttt prolly the thinnest I've been in years without stressing about it or torturing myself at the gym. Funny how that works. Instead I'm eating cheese and keeping my joy. 🧀 Its kind of nice. 🤗

On the start of my busiest week of the season, this morning I feel so much gratitude (and anxiety haha) I'm fortunate to have a thriving business, to be able to pursue so many of my passions and in two months I will be on vacation in this charming place with the love of my life. God is so good to us, his mercy and Grace abounds. We don't have the best of everything, but we make the best of everything we do have and that has always made all the difference. Cheers to staying in your joy! Have a great week. Lord be with me this week!

I just want to take a minute to appreciate this beautiful day, the fact that my neighborhood is absolutely darling and that it's a short ride to my favorite people for an afternoon of fun. But first, I stopped to take a belfie. (Bike Selfie 😂) P.S. I named her LaVerne. 🌿

My shirt is wrinkled, my office is a disaster, I probably shouldn't wear crop tops and I wish my thighs lost weight as quick my face does 😂 but I'm getting off this negative train to start my busy day off sorta. Following this weekend through then end of June, I have seven weddings. 🙆‍♀️ until then I plan on having some fun! First I have two sessions this morning. Fingers crossed the rain holds out. No one wants to see what happens when humidity touches this hair. 💛 Have a fabulous weekend friends!

Yesterday was the first day of my Summer semester and reading those syllabi made me dizzy, stressed. I'm already having those moments where I'm like how the heck am I going to manage all of this and run a business during wedding season. People ask me all the time how I do it, why I do it. And then I sit down to edit and there it is. I mean look at these two. I looked cute today too but does Instagram really need another selfie today? Probably not. This is way better. 😂 Deciding to put my business back into side hustle status was the best decision I ever made because I love photography again. Working with amazing clients who become friends and keeping it simple. It's changed everything and my business has allowed me to pursue a new purpose for my life. For that, I'm so grateful. I'll get through wedding season and homework, and all the other things because I love what I do. All of it. That's an awesome place be. 🖤 Ps. Love your gorgeous face @jenniferc_art

Happy Mother's Day! To the traditional Mothers, the Grandmothers the caregivers and spiritual Mothers, to the Educators who care for children daily and to those who for any reason are without Mom or their children today.....motherhood is really God's greatest gift that comes in many forms, arrives on many different paths. Today is a celebration of love in its purest form 🌿 I'm so fortunate to have this from both the traditional and untraditional ways from my own Mother, Mother in law and mentors. Do something special for you today. 💕

Not only an incredible Husband and friend, a phenomenal artist. I can't brag enough on you @tattoojohnaon and you're so humble.

Thank God for my tattoos, the only thing keeping me from looking like a total Martha. I'm getting better at letting my age go and I'm excited about high waisted pants being in style. On Saturday night, my Husband ask me if we would ever be grown ups and my answer, nope. Despite my wardrobe 😂 Cheers to growing old gracefully and playfully!

My heart is just exploding this morning for so many reasons. In a life that is constantly moving, I'm so thankful for the blessing to be able to stop, witness and capture the love of so many incredible people. I just adore these two.

Most days I prefer plants. 🌱😂 Some people make this really challenging, am I right? With a heart as big as mine I find myself pouring it into so much. My family, my studies, my work, my neighborhood, Church and often it leaves me feeling a little defeated when someone is rude or unkind about those efforts but I realize it often has nothing to do with me - especially since studying Psychology 😂😂😂😂😂 Anyway, there's one thing you can always do, in every situation, with every person and that is to BE KIND. Or go play in the garden, whatever works. Happy Wednesday!

An extra quiet morning, with only two days of class this week I'm feeling so much gratitude for an amazing first semester. 🙏 An accelerated and Honors program has not been without it's challenges and I spent time reflecting on the many who have helped me along the way.

You're smart and beautiful, he says. But, there isn't a filter to fix this mood. Real talk. Today I decided either the house will look good or I will. Guess which I picked? Neither 😂 I'm so ready for a real period of mind rest even if it is only a week. I need it. My big brain needs a wee vacay. I've been Ms. Mary Sunshine for a majority of my life but I guess it's been a long time coming, the grump had to come out eventually. So what. I'm human right? Though I may not look it today 😭 Thank you @tattoojohnaon for flirting me through waking up on the wrong side of the bed. ❤ Psych & MAT exams today. 📚

My Husband knows the best times to randomly send me photos he's taken that I didn't know about 🌱 Channeling my dirt play and gardening on this Monday morning, the start to another crazy week. 😂 I may need to roll around in the dirt before this day is through.

Gardening and her beautiful wildflower garden has been such a joy for my Mother in law but the upkeep is just too much for her sadly. I have some very treasured old favorites now planted in our yard and hoping I have a green thumb to nourish them. 🌱 I can't think of a better way to honor #earthday I also started my first little compost 🤗 veggie garden is next.

Thank God for social functions. I wouldn't wash my hair if it weren't for them 😂 wish I were joking. It's a beautiful day though and I look forward to seeing my favorites through out it and a date night with my Husband later. Hopefully my brows look okay though. One of my 9 year old students told me I did a bad job yesterday 😭 I can't make this stuff up. I think I'm going to start keeping a journal of all the things tiny humans tell me. Hope everyone is have a good weekend.

🖤 I get so caught up in handing in  assignments I tend to not even think about the impact of getting feedback. I'm so thankful for all of the amazing Educators and families who helped me this semester. I wouldn't have the knowledge, experience or grades I do without your help. Ready for Summer 18!

I heard a beautiful message the other day about the power of what is already inside of us. The traits we often forget, like courage, conviction, creativity and strength. How often we pray for the obvious, like cake....forgetting that we were born with the eggs, the flour, the oil, and everything else it takes to make cake. No matter how hard things get you've got to dig deep to get over the hump and believe that you can, because you can. There isn't a single circumstance that can break you so much that you won't recover. I promise. I've lived through the joyous chapters and devastating ones, but I've never let those stop me. P.S. I probably only remembered the message because they used cake as a metaphor 🤣 Either way, never lose sight of the magic inside....despite everything on the outside working to make sure you do.

Spent the afternoon, organizing files and completing the last of Spring 2018 assignments. My first semester as a full time college student has been life changing to say the least, many curveballs thrown my way but overall an amazing experience with an end result that reflects all of my hard work. But, it went by so fast! I'm ready for Summer, not so much Fall but one day at a time. All the things are done, just a few more classes to show up for because I can't ruin my perfect attendance 🤣 Breathing a sigh of relief and praying about the next few months ahead. I love you @tattoojohnaon. Your encouragement has been unwavering and I couldn't do this without you! #ontothenext #tobecontinued

It's flurrying and there was trash on our lawn. But I saw Spring in all it's glory this weekend so in my head, I'm staying there. It be great if I could do that until we retire and live off the grid permanently 🤣 but one day at a time right? #pma #stayoffmylawn

First hike of the year was a strenuous one for sure. I'll be feeling the five miles and those switchbacks for the next few days. Such a huge motivation to get myself moving more. Still such an amazing day and weekend. It's like the wind between the trees took weeks of stress away with it. 🌲 Looking forward to another great season of backpacking, camping and getting dirty. ✌

I've climbed a few mountains in my life, figuratively and literally. A reminder to myself that I can get through the next couple of weeks. I know Gods Grace is bigger than anything in front of me too. And, if all else fails I remember if Britney Spears survived 2007, I can do anything. 😂 @tattoojohnaon you're a blessing!!!!!

Standing in my kitchen patiently waiting for the sun to come up, the one we haven't seen in days. Reminded me of this moment at the end of summer last year ❤ I've been working non step on deadlines and trying to get ahead, it's nice to just pause and take it all in some times. It is also reminded me that we're once again retreating to the woods next week with good friends and I can't wait! 🌲🌲🌲 But now, off to 8 hours in class 📚🤓 Hope everyone has an amazing day!

It's true what they say, the path to your purpose can often be lonely yet simultaneously the most rewarding time of your life. Nearing the end of this semester knowing it's only the beginning, the work is only going to increase and that means more sacrifice. Yet, there is little worry and much excitement. For the first time in a very long time I looked down at my phone on Easter Sunday, a holiday, expecting to find many texts to respond to and there wasn't one. It hit me in that moment that I'm not as connected as I once was and though it made me a little sad, I looked at my Husband and felt incredibly blessed to have him. Life is changing every day and while there are less texts and messages, most days none the life I have is a reminder daily that there is an abundance of true love and what matters most. Though life is busy for myself and others in those silent moments you sometimes see the significance of simplicity. And I'm still connected, just to different things. So this is what getting older is like? 🤣 I feel nuts. This morning my Professor, an educator  for years, told me she admired me. It seemed so strange to me but I'm starting to get it. It takes being nuts, it takes guts and an insane amount of grit to give up all the things you once knew, to deliberately walk away from a life you once had - all to pursue purpose. So even when I'm feeling lonely I'm reminded of the legacy I want to leave behind and my own brilliant light that will get me there. Blaze your own path. 💕 It gets easier and it's worth it.

Hope everyone has had a wonderful Easter 🐰 We started our day with an amazing service this morning, followed with waffles, a long nap, planting and garden preparations, an early dinner and now rest. It's been a quiet day of reflection and time together ❤ ready for a new month and week ahead.

I never considered myself traditional, I never sought out the fairy tale life and for the majority of my start it was the farthest thing from a fairy tale. At a very young age I learned I had to take care of myself, if I wanted anything I would have to work very hard for it and I have. For a long time I was convinced I would be alone because letting someone in, being vulnerable again, was something I could never do. But I've changed, life has changed and this man has been a major part of those changes. I've never felt so supported, encouraged or loved as I do when I am with him...and it's unwavering. I never wanted to be taken care of, being extremely independent from a very young age but last night I was reminded of how amazing it is to have someone willing to, especially when you need it most. I was so sick 🤢 and it was awful, but this man comforted me and took care of me, like he has from the day we met. ❤ For loving me daily, for going out in the middle of the night to get me medicine, for covering me in blankets when I had the chills and for making me feel beautiful even when I felt like I was dying 😂 thank you Husband. Life and God's greatest gift to me has been bringing you into my life, has been being your wife. #hashtagblessed

I'm tired guys, real tired. 📚 On the plus side my handsome Husband came home from his long day and made me dinner. And, I figured out a use for oversized yoga pants! When you're braless you can just pull em up really high and they hold the girls in while you're at the dinner table. Pure genius 😂 That's all I got. Have a good night!

Yesterday was such an incredible day of fellowship, one of which I needed especially leading into Holy Week. As a child, it was one of my favorite weeks. Yes the Easter bunny comes, but oddly enough it's when I felt closest to my faith, at an age when I couldn't even really understand the magnitude of Christ's death and resurrection. I've been struggling spiritually the last few months for a myriad of reasons. We live in a world where religion is used to pass down judgment, to criticize and spread hate and honestly I've felt like I never want to be bucketed with that behavior, because that isn't Christianity. It's hard. It's left me embarrassed and sad, but yesterday I was reminded that those behaviors don't impact my relationship with God. Nothing changes it, though there are days when it's incredibly hard. But I love what Romans 8 35-39 says about this. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This week is a short school week for me and in my free time I'm looking forward to some quiet time to reflect, to pray, to prepare for the Easter weekend and be deliberate about serving more. As our Pastor put it so perfectly, be HIS Glory on display. Hope everyone has a blessed week. ❤🌿 #glory #daytonwomenintheword

Weekend errands "pre game" 🍵 one day to do everything I don't have time for during the week. #butfirstcoffee

I've changed my "look"more than Madonna. But it's apparent I've finally settled in to my Forever 71 look. 🤣 With more cardigans in my closet than a retirement community. But I'm happy. I'm so happy. I've made it to week 11 of my first semester in College, pretty much doubting myself along the entire way. Yet here I am, on the morning of a meeting to talk about my "Scholar Path." I was a C student at best my entire life so the idea of Scholar in the same sentence of my name is strange. It's amazing what life has taught me, what my own personal experiences have shaped and what daily encouragement and the love of an unfailing God has done for my life. I found at yesterday I will be eligible for #phithetakappa as well. Me? Honors Society. Well okay then. It's okay to be proud of the work I put in so today I am. Hours of studying and I've only just begun. My poor Husband, I may be a student for life. But, I see my potential for the first time. I see my myself in a very new light, much bigger than just a look. I'm so incredibly thankful for all of the opportunities coming my way despite a lifetime of doubt. Forever 71 and a nerd apparently. 📚 Happy Friday. Screw dreams. Never give up on yourself. 👍

Let's sit underneath the open sky and watch the night just pass us by let's me and you dream of the now and don't worry about tomorrow you know we will make it somehow Let us talk about our plan two lover's hand in hand and let's grow old together Let's let go of all the past all the tears and all the sorrow let's dream through a desert so wide and vast slow down and not take life so fast Let's let the sun shine down on you and me where we will always be forever and let's grow old together Let's stop and feel the wind blow through the canyon's of it's echo ride with me through life and it's beauty two soul's bound to be free Let's forget about days of yesterday start anew another day never to look back into the never and let's grow old together. 🖤 Spiritwind Wood

Project 1 for the weekend, the upstairs bathroom which I've done nothing with since moving. I was digging through my wedding galleries and found myself inspired by the color pallet of a brides bouquet. 2 hours later, bathroom done. 😍 Don't worry @tattoojohnaon, I left proof that a man lives here. 💕 You'll have the scroll through for the before. I didn't want the photo in my feed 😂😂😂

Some days I dance it out, others I cook it out. After a long first day back in class and three hours of homework...tonight it was cooking. I broiled a chicken to perfection and paired it with sweet potato risotto. 😍 So many flavors, no preservatives, only whole foods. Sorry for all the dishes @tattoojohnaon, hope it was worth it 🤣 #happyplateswithshana

Rested and though not fully, I feel restored. I've thoroughly enjoy my time off and Spring Break. Ready for the next 8 weeks and ending the semester on a great note 🙏. I was thankful to not only spend time with my Husband but a few of our dear friends as well. I'm looking forward to this Summer. See you guys in May! 😂 jk, I'll be around...sorta. 🤓📚

Second to Fall, Spring is my favorite but really the transitional period as winter ends. When the snow melts and new life underneath reveals itself.  I feel lucky to have this down time to see all that nature is working on. 💕

"All tides rise when we see a sister making this world a better place with her gifts." March is Women's History Month but I've found more than ever, that daily, I refer back to women who inspire me - courageous, intelligent, talented, honest and true to who they are. The characteristic I admire most in many is compassion and empathy, is love -kindness that is universal and unequivocally synonymous with who they are. Let's celebrate each other, not only this month but always. Whether you're single and climbing that career ladder, a Mother doing the same but juggling work, family and life, whether you work a 9-5, an entrepreneur or student at almost 40 :) Let's stop comparing and start loving - universally. Let's succeed, without tearing another down for doing it differently. Let's live our dreams without assuming our way is the only or right way. Let's achieve, together but differently, and be confident enough in ourselves to be okay with that. There is no wrong or right way, their is only yours. I've risen and fallen so many times in my life, I'm always changing, adapting, growing and always loving. I'm so thankful for the women in my life who've been able to support me through those changes - no judgment, no jealousy, STRONG body & mind, who inspire me daily to go my own way.

At the end of a long somewhat stressful day came an invite to sit on a porch and talk on a beautiful night with a lovely friend. We both randomly gave each other tea cups this afternoon, she also planted 🍄a garden in mine 😍. God has been all over this day. I'm juggling so much right now, so many of us are. But it's moments like this afternoon I'm reminded of how awesome it is to just make time to sit still, stop and notice the simple things that bring us joy, like an almost spring day. I also had an awesome conversation with a 2.5 year old who's energy made me smile and the study and report I have to do seems less of a task after meeting him. All this joy foot steps from our home. 💕 Today was a good day, in a great neighborhood.

Today was my first day tutoring at Ruskin Elementary 🍎 My heart is so full. Years of jobs, a long time career, many interviews and never once did I feel the way I did today walking into school. It all makes sense now, this path God has chosen for me. I'm incredibly blessed for the opportunity to be around these little miracles and help them see how special they are! 📚

Got a text from a friend today, "Are you okay?" Hasn't seen many social media posts. 😂 I assure everyone I am okay, actually I'm great! I'm busy and if you look close enough my grey roots confirm this. I promise I'm not becoming a hermit though the idea of it is somewhat enticing. Nope, I'm just studying! I never expected to love school as much as I do and so it's somewhat taken over my life. I'm fascinated, in short..but my program is accelerated so I'm swamped. Tomorrow I'm actually taking my first final because I opted to take A&B of a course in one semester. Also, I'm thrilled to start tutoring 3rd graders at Ruskin tomorrow. . I'm wearing jeans again (with post it note reminders so I don't forget stuff) again which is cool, my healthy habits continue aside from this week's cookie incident and a few others. Warmer weather is inspiring me! I'll be back to the Happy Plates group in March. Aside from this we continue to have an active role in our neighborhood and of course first and foremost, our faith. If you all don't know it by know @tattoojohnaon is and has been amazing. Spring break is a week away, pretty sure I still won't be around and sleeping instead but again I'm good! Promise. I'm just taking more time to absorb what's around me instead of what's on my phone but if you need me I'm just a message or call away. Just be patient. 🙏 Anyway that's all I have, gotta get back to the pile behind me. #imfine #hopeyoureallfinetoo

Emotions are high, thoughts deep. The last couple of weeks I've felt overwhelmed by many internal struggles. Crazy thing about knowledge is that it forces you to dig deep. Beautiful thing about faith is that it helps you sort it out. .......... I typed and untyped my response to heartbreaking news this week about a dozen times. In the wake of another horrible tragedy and school shooting I find myself not wanting to be part of the debate but the solution and it dawned on me what the problem is in our culture. We want to debate, not resolve. ........... We want to stay comfortable in the sides we choose, black or white, right or left. Not realizing the opportunity that exists within the grey area. The grey area is where curiosity lies. It's where you ask the questions that lead you to a more well rounded conclusion, not always the answer but a more informed rational. It's what leads to conversations that need to happen. ........... Instead of debating gun laws we need to discuss the warning signs. We need to address behavioral issues, red flags. We need to talk about mental illness but not in association with violence, rather how to address the needs of those who need it before it's too late. ............ How do we get to the grey area? The grey area is what we are missing. It's the center, it's the place of all the things we aren't thinking about. Not the center that includes only ourselves - but the center of our culture that is in dire need of redirection. ............. As a future teacher I'm not frightened by gun violence. I'm frightened by ignorance. I'm frightened by blatant disregard of warning signs or the lack of knowledge in how to address those signs. I'm frightened by bullying and the drastic changes in family dynamics that plague our children, catastrophically impacting their development and leading to mental unstableness. I'm frightened by the detrimental focus of our youth on social validation and it dictating their self concept. I'm frightened by our focus as a society and our tendency to dwell in the black and white, missing the opportunity and solutions yet to be found in the grey. We've got to stop fighting and start talking.

Okay two posts today, because I mean..... 😍 not only is he the kindest most humble person I've ever met, but just an incredible artist. 💗 His handmade Valentine this year, a painting of a photo taken of us on our FIRST date! Way better than mine as per usual 😂🤠 Love you @tattoojohnaon

My Husband's response to "Don't get me flowers" this photo does them no justice and I came out of social sabbatical to post this beautiful work of @sherwoodflorist because in March they won't be as pretty 🤣 Seriously, my heart stopped when I finally looked up from doing homework to notice him standing there with this beautiful arrangement. Just another reminder of how blessed I am to not only have John as a Husband and best friend, but a friend in floral design who knows how to put me in a puddle of 💗💗💗 love and miss you ladies! Thank you my sweet Husband @tattoojohnaon, my everyday Valentine ❤ Back to studying 📚

Sunday the way it's meant to be spent. Sleeping in, sweats, greasy spoon, lots of love. Full bellies too 😂 At times life feels a little "normal" but if normal brings you joy, it's pretty magical.

We do have a rule in this house about animals on furniture. 😂 They show me what they think about it everyday.

Sometimes the reminders are subtle, other days not so much. I couldn't help but smile seeing this - especially after this week. In pursuing a new path I've found myself missing out on so much yet my heart is so full questioning what is "so much"? This week I decided to move forward with volunteering with Dayton Public feeling as though I can't wait for my degree, there's work to be done now while I'm working towards the bigger picture. I was also nominated for our neighborhood board, a touching sentiment I'm still praying about and was appointed Chair of our neighborhood's biggest event and home tour this Fall. I shared with my Husband that I didn't feel I was giving enough to my faith and then stopped myself realizing these two things. Living in the word means two things, Loving God and Loving Others. Though I haven't had time to really reflect and pray - I'm living those two truths. A new friend reminded me that in the hardest and busiest of times, if we let HIM, his love will sustain us. I'm holding onto this through it all while serving a community I love. 🙏

I need a tan 😂 wait no I don't 💋 aside from my waist size shrinking my skin seems to be literally glowing lately, my hair growing like crazy. Must be all those brussel sprouts. It felt nice to put jeans on but not gonna lie I miss yoga pants. Anyway there's no real point to this post other to say it feels good to feel good. Have a good night kids!

I've never been happier to have prepped meals in the house. Husband is down with the flu and with a ton of other things to get done being able to make soup in ten minutes is 🙌 Crockpot chicken into soup for the patient. 🍊 Btw...dear world, if you're sick stay home! Stop spreading that love, no one wants it. 😂 Thank you. Back to being a nurse. 🤕😷❤

I feel like the Lord, more than ever, is in hot pursuit of my heart, of my mind, my everything. I've done so much in my life, I've achieved and I have failed but never in all any of those moments did I ever feel as held as I do now. So much is changing. There are days where my heart feels burdened by all I will face ahead. Can I do this? Do I want to do this? The answer, this is what HE wants and though I may have felt like this was my choice, my heart know better. I'm following a call. I will never forget standing in service with my Husband just over two years ago, crying and praying for purpose in my life. To be strong enough to do what HE wants for my life, not what I want.  And now I feel like I've finally started. In between the hours of studying, doors have been opening left and right, it's as if God is literally singing over my life right now and this path, all the while healing from my past struggles, my motivation for becoming a Teacher. It's been hard, REAL hard. But This mountain that's in front of me will be thrown upon the midst of the sea. 🙏 It's the best overwhelmed I've ever felt. God is literally wrecking my world in the best possible way imaginable.

I'm not sure what's sweeter, the home office he set up for me, the vintage encyclopedias he brought up from the basement, him asking me where I will hang my Degree(s) or the fact that he did this all tonight when he is sick. How did I ever get so lucky? This love is truly extraordinary ❤ I love you @tattoojohnaon and this is much better than homework at the kitchen table, our "parlor" and your man cave 🤣 Handmade Bookshelves by @dlloyd95 🤗🤗🤗

A bittersweet end to one chapter as I continue on a new journey and chapter. ❤ Though I am a closing the physical studio this doesn't mean the end of ANYTHING. This was a necessary strategic decision to better meet the needs of our ever changing customer. A sincere thank you to the Davis Linden Building and our community of friendors like @somethingolddayton as well as the community of Dayton. ALL of you have been integral in helping @goodnessandgracephoto grow🙏. I'm beyond excited for the 2018 Wedding season and all the amazing things that lie ahead!

Starting Monday like 🍵+🙏 This weekend literally flew by, minus the adventure of getting two 7 ft 🌵 into the house. God bless you @tattoojohnaon ❤ I seriously wanted to stay home today because I feel like I need a day to just sit and figure out how I'm going to accomplish all that I have on my plate. "I can do all things through Christ" ringing through my brain on replay. But beneath my stress is a feeling of great joy and gratitude for the wisdom and courage to pursue purpose. I'm just working on doing so with Grace. Off to 📚 have a great day and week y'all!

There is beauty that sometimes comes from tragedy. When I recently lost my Grams my family and I shared so many stories and memories. I found out she had a "kitchen club" with her friends that lived in her apartment building in the Bronx. I've been holding onto those stories, keeping them close to my heart.  I've also been holding onto those recipes. ❤ Tonight I'm hosting my first "Kitchen Club" for the ladies in my neighborhood. I can't think of a better way to get to know each other more and form what hopefully will be a new tradition in Huffman for fellowship, women encouraging women, recipes and well, cocktails. 🍸 I've been looking forward to tonight for a while. Now to decide on a recipe to share 📖 Don't worry Grams, I won't share the family Cheesecake recipe. 😍

Thursday's are my longest day in class and today's subject matters were tough. My brain hurt. But after my #poundworkout at @turbozone_fitness with @e_rock7 and dinner at @corelifeeatery with @_heatherkathleen_ I feel on top again ❤ a little Netflix and chill with @tattoojohnaon and this day ends perfectly. So thankful tomorrow is 🍟YAY.
