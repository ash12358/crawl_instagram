I have gotten pretty good at drawing what I see, like from photos or whatever, but that's not good enough for me; I need to be able to draw what I see in my head, and right around the time I start feeling like this is when I give up on art because it's frustrating for me to not be able to do something that seems to come so easily to other people. That stops now. Learning to draw bone structures so that I don't have to look for pics with poses I need. Idk how lofty of a goal this is, but I will at least give it an honest go this time. Wish me luck.

I've seen it said on the interwebz that you can't be a "snack" of you got stretch marks; obviously THOSE people have never experienced the joy of oatmeal cream pies. In fact, ALL the best snacks got stretch marks, remember that.

Apparently, today is #nationalselfieday and #throwbackthursday. I can't pay my actual favorite selfies, but these run a very close second.

This should be pretty self explanatory, but another way to look at it is this; art should make those who would normally be excluded FEEL included, and open everyone else's eyes to what they aren't seeing. It's empowering to look at a portrait of someone who looks like you and realize that if you find that portrait beautiful, you can feel the same about your self. When you aren't the norm in society, it becomes so much more important to be able to see someone who does look like you. Conversely, it's important that people who normally see themselves represented all the time to see that diversity is beautiful.

Shout out to @clothesfreelife and @kheici for making me feel better about my art today. I've been kinda down about it lately, so often it feels like posting anything is pointless, like shouting into the void; I know the point of art isn't to get noticed (unless art is your business), but it feels good when people notice.

Interesting story about this sunflower; I took this picture before church, planning on shooting this with my actual camera later that day. Later came, and I went out as planned, except this particular flower want there anymore, some one had come during the day and cut it for a bouquet or something. I'm sure there is some lesson to be gleaned from this, take from it what you will. My lesson was that plans sometimes change, and that's didn't have to be a bad thing. I still went out and photographed some sunflowers. . #photography #flowers #nature #sunflowers

I've gotten super lazy about carrying my actual camera around because I can so easily get shots like this with my phone, but Imma try and do better with that since it's warming up and spring is coming #nature #photography #smartphone_photos #smartphonephotography

I doodled a bunch of these months ago; they were inspired by the idea of doing a photography series in a sunflower field. But I couldn't do that, so I drew these instead. #art #digitalart #sketch #figuredrawing

Be an artist made of art. Its natural to want ever just some basic recognition for your art, I know I do. But that last part is crucial; relying on other for validation of your art will have you feeling ALL the emotions. And yes, I'm saying to myself just as much as anyone else.

So, I had this idea for a series of sketches about 2 weeks ago; I keep bouncing around what I wanted to say about them, but I realize now it's doesn't really matter what I say, it's open to your interpretation really... I put that first panel there for two reasons; shock buffer and because they actually mean something to the sketches . #art #digitalart #sketch #digitalsketch

There's been a ton of cool paintings I'd study/use for inspiration and practice, and apparently they were almost all by this guy. I'm glad to have made this discovery.

Idk about you, but I've seen this quote many times, but it wasn't until very recently that I really understood what this means. Of course, it might mean something different to each person, but REALLY getting it has inspired me.

Dear Friends, This year, I really wanna grow my art. I need to. I simply can't sit on this, my heart and soul won't let me. If you're reading this, I want you to be apart of the journey; if YOU have an idea you've always wanted to shoot, let's do it. You wanna shoot something and have no idea what? Let's talk, we'll figure it out. Either way, let's engage in some creativity this year people!

This is a little out of the norm; I don't know of many artists that post things they screw up, but that's what this is. Obviously, half the page is missing because I ruined that half, but I decided that is try and salvage the other half instead of throwing away the whole thing... I kinda like it personally, not because it's a great piece or anything, but just... Something about it... #art #watercolor #figuredrawing #inking

On the one hand, I kinda feel like this is borderline petty/hatin' . . . But on the other hand, it's 100 true. I know I'm not the BEST in the photo (or drawing) game, but I've seen people with less talent get more work and more shine. Not to detract from them, because there's room for everyone to make it, but if they can do, I CAN DO IT.

Y'all really don't understand just how much having support really means to a creative. Special thank you to all my friends that put up with me sending drafts of art and photo edits before everyone else gets to see the finished product, y'all the real MVP. ALSO, shout-out to @newmoonvisuals, because sometimes just conversing with another creative can make a world of difference too.

This is one of the best things you can do for yourself, probably one of the hardest too. It's hard to be yourself in a world that says conform; but, don't listen to them, DO YOU.

Pretty self explanatory; I've been trying to apply this to my art. I have this love/hate relationship with it, I quit drawing because I felt like I want ever good at it, but I never got good because I kept letting my perfectionist attitude get in the way. So, I'm trying to do better because I owe myself that.

Cassiopea (upside-down jellyfish) is a genus of true jellyfish and the only members of the family Cassiopeidae. (These are really strange to watch btw)  #jellyfish #ripleysaquarium

There was a time when I absolutely HATED taking pictures of flowers, because all I wanted to do was shoot portraits... Obviously things have changed a little bit and I'm now in a place where I appreciate being able to be aware of what's around me and take some time out to capture it. BUT, I still wanna shoot more portraits!!!

Ok, so, earlier this year, I got the chance to do some experimenting with blacklights and UV paint... I'm now looking to add to this project with some creative individuals.

Y'all... So, I need to really start doing this... My soul dies a little bit every day I don't, and the really hasn't been much creating this year. I personally prefer it to be photography, but maybe I'm being told to focus on my other talents for a while???
