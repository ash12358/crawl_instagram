Even with the current heatwave in the U.K. I’m dreaming of getting away and going on a much needed holiday. A week in Lisbon sounds about perfect right now. That’ll sadly have to wait until next year, but in the meantime at least I can enjoy some of the best Pasteis de Nata around - even better when you manage to get them while their still warm fresh out of the oven like we did on Sunday ——————————————————————————— #pasteis #pasteisdenata #custardtarts #portuguesecuisine #portuguese #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #eaterlondon #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #londonfood #tastingtable #bakefromscratch #thebakefeed #bakery #londonfood #instabake

Today’s plans didn’t include burgers, but when you’re at @victoriaparkmkt and see @motherflipperuk and realise it’s been WAY too long since you last had their candied bacon burger what else are you supposed to do! And I’m pleased to say this burger is just as good as I remember 🤤🍔 ——————————————————————————— #cheeseburger #burgers #candiedbacon #burgerweekly #biggestburgers101 #infatuationlondon #cheatday #cheatmeal #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #eaterlondon #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #londonfood #tastingtable

Earlier this week I spent a lovey day with the team @brayscottage as we sliced up and handed out 1,000 pies to everyone attending @sohohouse Festival. As these are legitimately my favourite pies ever I was in pie heaven! Plus as an added bonus I then got to listen to some great live music including the Manic Street Preachers.

After getting stuck in a YouTube spiral yesterday I ended up watching the brilliantly bizzare “Cooking with Dog” series, and their video for tantanmen noodles was stuck in my head. So some quick research this morning and a trip to Chinatown and I was back in the kitchen trying to make it myself. And considering I’ve never made this before it tasted damn good. Loads of heat from the Sichuan peppercorns and the La-Yu chilli oil this is a perfect middle ground between ramen and Dandan noodles. Definitely going to be making this again soon ————————————————————— #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #eaterlondon #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #londonfood #tastingtable #imadethis #tantanmen #tantanmenramen #ramen #ramennoodles

Still to this day one of my favourite sandwiches in London - the @montys_deli pastrami on rye with plenty of coleslaw and Russian dressing and served of course with a pickle on the side.

While I was in Paris I drank SO much coffee - it’s easily one of my favourite coffee cities. Whether it’s the filter coffee from @tenbelles and @cafesbelleville, the lattes from @parispartisancafe or the iced coffees from @bootcafe and @cafekitsune this city has so much to offer! #foodbeast #eeeeeats #eaterparis #feedfeed #dailyfoodfeed #onthetable #f52grams #tastingtable #eater #tastemade #igersparis #paris #parisfood #WhenInParis #traveldiaries #travelblogger #travelawesome #wanderlust #igersparis #france #butfirstcoffee #parisjetaime #coffee #tenbelles #pariscoffee #igerscoffee

Despite being on holiday for nearly a week now the ironic thing is that I’ve been up early every day. Whether I was trying to cram in as much as I could in Paris, or getting up early to go running in the last two days, I’ve basically been waking up at 6:30! So today I took proper advantage of not being at work and had a proper lie in until 10 followed by a lovely breakfast with some of the tasty stuff I brought back from France. So we’ve got coffee from @cafesbelleville (in my favourite @holybellycafe mug) with toast from @tenbellesbread and butter from Brittany. Can’t beat the jam from @newtonandpott though - especially this mixed berries and lemon thyme variety 👍🏻 ———————————————————————————#foodbeast #eeeeeats #eaterparis #feedfeed #dailyfoodfeed #onthetable #f52grams #tastingtable #eater #tastemade #igersparis #paris #parisfood #WhenInParis #bakestagram #bakery #traveldiaries #travelblogger #travelawesome #wanderlust #igersparis #france #tenbellesbread #belleville #holybelly #toast #specialitycoffee #JeBoisDuBelleville

Since I’ve taken up running I’ve started a little tradition that is quickly becoming one of my favourite things. When I run a 10km event through central London I pick up my medal and head straight to @bleeckerburger for my favourite burger of all time - the bacon double cheeseburger! So as I ran the @vitalitylondon10k today that’s exactly what I did - the thought of that burger gives me all the motivation needed to finish 😂 ————————————————————— #bleeckerburger #burger #cheeseburger #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #eaterlondon #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #londonfood #tastingtable

Happy Birthday to me (and my brother @theboywhobakes) and I can’t think of a better place to start my new year than in Paris. After an early morning 4km run along the Seine I kicked the day off with a visit to @karamel_paris_officiel which I only heard about for the first time two weeks ago. Their patisserie is so good, I couldn’t resist getting one of these giant palmiers as well as a couple of other treats. Now to.

After how impressed I was last year there was no way I was coming back to Paris without having doughnuts from @boneshakerparis.

First day in Paris and after being locked out of my Airbnb for about 2 hours I’m finally starting to relax.  No matter what else I do on this trip my first port of call was always going to be Du Pain et Des Idees for a pistachio and chocolate escargot. So as soon as I got off the @eurostar I walked across for my breakfast.

Well if you can’t enjoy a treat after a long run when can you? This morning after running 12km around the city before 09:30 I was wandering around trying to find a coffee shop open that early on a bank holiday when I passed @fabriquebakery.

Came out of my baking hibernation today as I couldn’t resist making a batch of these brownie cookies from @theboywhobakes.

I’m not doing a lot of baking at the moment, but when I do it will pretty much always involve chocolate.

Watching the Winter Olympics all day has oddly got me craving ice cream. And what I wouldn’t give to be enjoying this amazing concoction from @happyendingsldn again.

I don’t often post pictures of myself on this account, but I thought today called for something a bit different. So it may have been apparent that I’ve been a bit quiet on instagram for the last year or so, and that’s because since last January I’ve been on a bit of a mission to lose weight and get fit. And because I’ve been really quite single minded about that goal I haven’t really been doing all the usual food things that I would normally post about. In fact today for example I had the first burger I’ve had in over a year! But all of that hard work has paid off having lost well over 100lbs so far! I’ve also taken up running in the last few months and today completed my first ever 10km race, with a really amazing time of 1 hour and 9 minutes. Me a year ago would never have even considered doing what I did today. Anyway if you’re at all interested in following that side things by all means check out my other account @slimmingsimon. But I’ll still be posting here of course (one burger photo coming up later today).

Good thing about a weekend of bad weather is spending it inside cooking all the comfort food! Yesterday I made these delicious tray baked cumin and turmeric chicken thighs with crispy chickpeas and lemony onions (recipe from @alisoneroman in @nytfood).

How cute are these mini bars of chocolate from @pumpstreetchocolate - couldn’t resist buying one when I saw them yesterday. Still one of my favourite chocolate makers, definitely need to make it out to the bakery in 2018 #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #tastingtable #thebakefeed #chocolate #pumpstreetchocolate #pumpstreetchocolate #chocolate

What a brilliant night of politics watching the London recordings of #podsaveamerica and #lovettorleaveit. If you’re not already listening to these podcasts you really need to - such a great way to balance out all the Trump Craziness! And Love it or Leave it is just hilarious - tonight’s recording was with @stephenmerchant @mrnishkumar and Shaista Aziz #crookedmedia #podtourstheworld #politics

Good thing about it being cold at the moment is that it’s the perfect time for all the nice comforting food. I’m taking about soups, stews and curries - and this weekend I’ve filled the freezer with all three! Including this very tasty cumin roasted butternut squash soup with some nice heat from dried ancho chillies. #eeeeeats #thecookfeed #feedfeed #f52grams #eater #tastemade #onthetable #foodblogfeed #heresmyfood #eaterlondon #dailyfoodfeed #igerslondon #londonfood #tastingtable #imadethis #soup

Leaving Yorkshire today, but before getting on the train across to Lancashire we just managed to fit in a quick lunch at @northstarcoffeeshop. Very quickly this place has become one of my favourite spots in Leeds and in large part because of the delicious baked goods from @noisettebakehouse like this Morning Cake I had today. #leedsfood #leeds #eeeeeats #noisettebakehouse #northstarcoffeeshop #yorkshirefood #coffeeshop #thebakefeed #f52grams #tastingtable #eater #dailyfoodfeed #foodblogfeed

I’m back in Yorkshire and spent the day in Leeds finishing up my Christmas shopping, but also taking the chance to check out a few new places (or at least new to me). I started at @templecoffeeleeds with a lemon doughnut, then grabbed a coffee at @kapowcoffee before jumping on the water taxi to finish off with lunch and a @noisettebakehouse salted caramel Yule Log @northstarcoffeeshop Amazing how much the food scene seems to be growing and changing each time I come home. Seems like lots of exciting stuff going on at the moment. #leedsfood #templecoffee #kapowcoffee #noisettebakehouse #northstarcoffeeshop #eeeeeats #yorkshirefood #coffeeshop #doughnuts #thebakefeed #f52grams #tastingtable #eater #dailyfoodfeed #leeds #foodblogfeed

Well it’s my last day in London for 2017 so I made Christmas lunch for me and my flatmate and the fact I timed it all with everything properly cooked, nothing burnt or raw is a miracle! Can’t beat the @seriouseats roast potatoes and my Yorkshire puddings are the best I’ve ever made!

In London tomorrow? Then make sure to head to @oldspitalfieldsmarket for #BakeforSyria 2. This was such a great event last time with so much cake sold for a brilliant cause @cookforsyria.

My four whirlwind days in Paris with my brother @theboywhobakes are almost over.

Well today was full of wonderful coffee from @cafesbelleville. We started with breakfast at @lafontainedebelleville (my new favourite place for coffee in Paris), then had a really fun morning at the Brûlerie doing a cupping with their head roaster @mihaela_iordache_ and then finally heading over to their newest cafe (in the old @cream.belleville site) to pick up a bag of their Neptaly Bautista beans from Honduras.

Well day 2 in Paris has been fantastic, if a little heavy on the sugar 😊 But I definitely didn’t expect to find one of the best doughnuts I’ve ever had. This Whisky and Caramelised Bacon doughnut from @boneshakerparis was SO good, the bacon was better than on any other I’ve tried (and I love a bacon doughnut).

So with my brother @theboywhobakes currently on holiday in Japan I’ve been getting a bit envious of everything he’s doing and especially of everything he’s eating. So when @cheftimanderson’s new book popped through the door yesterday I knew my weekend was going to include ramen. The book is full of brilliant looking food and this recipe for “Surprisingly Awesome One Hour Spicy Miso Ramen” is the business!!

Hard to believe but I did my first proper bit of baking in over 6 months this morning with these Banana Buckwheat and Chocolate cookies (BBC cookies!). I've had the idea floating about in my head for a few weeks, so finally gave them a go. They've turned out a bit like banana bread in cookie form, which I'm not sad about at all! Also had a bit of fun with video while making these - check out my IG story to see the result #thebakefeed #foodbeast #eeeeeats #eatfamous #feedfeed #dailyfoodfeed #onthetable #lifeandthyme #f52grams #tastingtable #huffposttaste #heresmyfood #buzzfeast #eattheworld #eater  #foodandwine #tastemade #flatlay

Only 4 years to go until we hear Big Ben again. For over 3 years I worked in Westminster and I never once got tired of hearing the bells ringing as I worked.

Sometimes you just see a recipe and know you have to make it, and that's exactly what I did today with these crispy spicy chicken thighs. I saw the recipe on @donalskehan's YouTube channel 3 hours ago and went straight out to buy the ingredients. 3 hours later and I'm eating these super tasty Mission Chinese inspired chicken thighs (the recipe calls for wings)

Paris here I come! Eurostar booked to take me back to Paris in October, for my first proper visit since 2013. By then I'll have been on my health kick/diet for the best part of 10 months, so I'm really looking forward to eating all the pastries and drinking all the wine I can in 4 days!

Probably a mistake to look at photos from yesterday's #bakeforsyria event before heading to the gym. Will now be fixated on these @breadaheadboroughmarket doughnuts while I'm on the treadmill!

#bakeforsyria has been such a crazy day! We sold out by 1pm - it's been such a whirlwind. But it was loads of fun and I've met so many people from IG (though I'm terrible and keep forgetting who I've met). Luckily I managed to snag one of @theboywhobakes salted caramel meringue brownies before they were all gone

If you like cake and live in London make sure you come down to Columbia Road tomorrow between 10am and 5pm for #bakeforsyria Bakers including @brickhousebread @fattiesbakery @violetcakeslondon @lily_vanilli_cake @dominiqueansellondon @thegoodegg_ and @theboywhobakes are selling their delicious baked goods in support of a brilliant cause. Should be a great day!

I'm set up @theboywhobakes house for the day getting ready for tomorrow's #bakeforsyria event at Columbia Road. There's so much delicious looking cake coming out of his oven (though this particular cake isn't for tomorrow) . He's got me on cookie dough duty so make sure you come and buy them all tomorrow

After a few days feeling wiped out by food poisoning and not leaving the house at all yesterday, it's good to be out and about just exploring the city

Such an important election today. Make sure to go out and vote to protect our public services from another term of Theresa May and the Tory cuts. The NHS and the police do incredible jobs day in day out and are in desperate need of investment and the last few years show they won't get it from the Conservatives. #vote #votelabour #ge2017

"I Gave Myself Time" by @rather_severe So much amazing art on display in Portland, but I think this one (part of a campaign to tackle the stigma around depression)  was my favourite.

Is it too early to start thinking about my next holiday? I've only been back in the office for 8 hours but my mind keeps drifting off to the last two weeks - really tempted to book a return trip to Portland pretty soon
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ed447d3badfd878a8d121bcf299ccbd8/5BCB115E/t51.2885-15/e35/18723523_1557457184298599_3609435578631716864_n.jpg
Back home in London and I've spent the afternoon catching up with @theboywhobakes drinking coffee while he does some baking experiments

I'm back in the UK after an amazing two weeks of travelling around the Pacific Northwest. Seattle, Portland and finally Vancouver haven't disappointed with pretty much perfectly blue skies and temperatures around 30 degrees most days. I've had such a relaxing time - even losing my passport at Heathrow won't ruin this trip. Time to get planning my return trip I think...
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8be3d4ecab494c4c5600f8815b2e8ceb/5BE18D4E/t51.2885-15/e35/18722901_444470672576604_7449136517349376000_n.jpg
Last full day of my holiday and I really don't want to go back to the UK - I haven't felt this relaxed in years. So I spent the day exploring downtown Vancouver and had to go and get one last coffee from @revolvercoffee, love this place
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d37267dcae75c4734fcf47aae0b7eb39/5BE36B86/t51.2885-15/e35/18646201_795807503901939_4869585352714616832_n.jpg
Can't believe it took me nearly two weeks in the US and Canada to have a burger. But this double cheeseburger from @deadbeetzfoodtruck in Victoria did the job very well!

14 years ago I visited Canada and had something called Tiger Tiger ice cream for the first time 🍦 It's an orange ice cream with a liquorice swirl and it tastes so good. Well I'm back in Canada and my family here tracked some down for me as a surprise so I could have it again more than a decade later. And it tastes as good as I remember 😊

Well Portland has taken all my expectations and smashed them - absolutely loved this city, and really sad to be leaving. If it was an option to move here tomorrow I'd do it. Just time for one last @bluestardonuts and one last cup of coffee from @stumptowncoffee before flying to Vancouver

So glad I made it to @olympiaprovisions before I left Portland. Had a very tasty lunch of Italian charcuterie and local beer - their mortadella and Italian sausage were perfect!

Portland has really delivered on the coffee front, so far in the last three days I've hit up @stumptowncoffee @heartroasters @casestudycoffee @coavacoffee @neverlab @baristapdx @goodcoffeepdx and I've still got a good 12 hours to fit in a couple of others 😁

Last full day in Portland is starting off VERY well with a visit to @pinest8biscuits for my 1st experience of biscuits and gravy. Went all in and got the Reggie Deluxe which had fried chicken, bacon, egg and cheese in addition to the actual biscuit and gravy! Why don't we have this in the UK - it was so good.

On the bus back to my Airbnb tonight I spotted this amazing old cinema, so I had to jump off and take some photos. So much nicer than the local Vue or Odeon cinema, it's called the Laurelhurst Theatre and dates back to 1923

This trip is turning out to have some truly great pizza! Tonight was the soppressata pizza from @kensartisan and without doubt it's one of the best I've had in ages 👍🏻 The sourdough base was perfectly cooked and the toppings were so fresh each bite was just full of flavour 🍕👌🏻

Well I've made the trip to Voodoo Doughnuts and can safely say that Blue Star are the best doughnuts in Portland. Voodoo are probably more fun, but they're so sweet!

Couldn't come to Portland and not try @nongskhaomangai. On the face of it, it looks so plain, but this chicken and rice had serious flavour! Perfect way to round off another great day in this city

It's amazing how much great coffee Portland has to offer. Today alone, in between a bit of shopping, I've visited @coavacoffee @goodcoffeepdx and @stumptowncoffee - and there's still loads more to try. I've got two more days in the city so still plenty of caffeine time left.

Found the best views of Seattle last night at Kerry Park. Was a bit surreal though, as together with all the tourists the park was full of students dressed up for prom and about 6 wedding parties all taking photos in front of the skyline! #kerrypark #skyline #wanderlust #travelawesome #instapassport #exploringtheglobe #travelon #roamtheplanet #Seattle #seattlewa #pnwonderland #VisitSeattle #LiveWashington #seattlepulse

How good is Poutine?! I headed to the West End neighbourhood of Vancouver today to check out La Belle Patate. Their menu has 28 different options but I went classic for my first poutine experience. I could barely finish half the plate but it was so good, this has got to be a must-try for any trip to Canada #poutine #wanderlust #travelawesome #foodbeast #eeeeeats #eatfamous #feedfeed #dailyfoodfeed #onthetable #f52grams #tastingtable #huffposttaste #heresmyfood #buzzfeast #eattheworld #eater #foodandwine #foodblogfeed #tastemade #pnw #yvr #mustbevancouver #pnwonderland #vancitynow

Day 1 of my holiday done and after something like 14 hours of travel door to door I didn't have much energy to do much except crash. Luckily I'd chosen a hotel with pretty impressive views over downtown Vancouver, and I had one of the best nights sleep in ages. Today agenda - find some poutine and then head off to Seattle! #instapassport #travelog  #wanderlust #travelawesome #theglobewanderer #exploringtheglobe #travelon #roamtheplanet  #pnw #downtownvancouver #yvr #mustbevancouver #pnwonderland #vancitynow

Goodbye London, time to fly away for a few weeks and relax ✈️ Currently on my way to the airport headed on a two week trip to Vancouver, Seattle and Portland 🇺🇸🇨🇦To say I'm excited is an understatement. Feels like ages since I've properly been away (because it has) and I'm massively in need of a break.

Well I got a big surprise this afternoon - I'm going to Paris! As well as a copy of @lostncheeseland's great book @theboywhobakes has bought me Eurostar tickets for my birthday 👍🏻 Now just to pick a date and get planning

I'm back on the healthy food (hello salad for lunch) after spending two days surrounded by some of the most delicious baking there is. Currently wishing I'd managed to sneak away with one of these @brayscottage pork pies 😍 If there's a better pork pie out there I haven't found it #porkpie #brayscottage #thebakefeed #eeeeeats #f52grams  #feedfeed #tastemade #eater #foodphotography #foodbeast

Back to work this morning after an extra long bank holiday weekend and I really wish I had some of this delicious Rwandan coffee from @outpostcoffeeroasters left.

So since the start of the year I've been on a bit of a health kick, I'm trying to eat much healthier and have been going to the gym. I'm even doing a sponsored run in 5 weeks (see link in description). And while it's been going really well - I've lost 3 stone in 11 weeks! - some days like today all I want to do is eat all the bread and cheese! #pavilionbakery #broadwaymarket #londonfood #eeeeeats #eatfamous #feedfeed #dailyfoodfeed #onthetable #lifeandthyme #f52grams #tastingtable #huffposttaste #heresmyfood #buzzfeast #eattheworld #eater #foodandwine #foodblogfeed #beautifulcuisines #tastemade

One of this weekends loaves and I think it's the best I've made so far! 👍🏻🍞 I'd like a more open texture but I'm getting there! (Using an adapted recipe from @maurizio the bread was 75% hydration with 8% rye flour) #food #f52grams #feedfeed #feastagram  #foodstagram #instafood #foodandwine #EEEEEats #thebakefeed #sourdough #sourdoughbread #realbread

Freshly baked sourdough straight from my oven this morning and first loaf since my @brickhousebread class last week! So happy with the result, especially as I went to A&E halfway through making it #food #f52grams #feedfeed #feastagram  #foodstagram #instafood #foodandwine #EEEEEats #onthetable #sourdough #sourdoughbread #bread #baking #highhydration #realbread
