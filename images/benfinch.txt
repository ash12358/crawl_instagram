Happy 14-year Anniversary to my bride, @joybfinch. Oh the stories they would tell if these walls could talk. I can still vividly recall having so many friends/family down in South Alabama helping us celebrate our wedding. Many stood beside us on that day & even more stand beside us now. We are thankful. Joy is by far the greatest & most tangible expression of God’s grace in my life. #withagratefulheart // Thankful to my dear friend @juliepaisleyphotography for these pics on our 10-year anniversary in Amelia Island :)

10 years ago our firstborn, Brennan, was born minutes before Mother’s Day. I’ll never forget watching @joybfinch hold him as she knew he’d be her greatest Mother’s Day gift. 3 additional kiddos later & she’s as lovely as ever! So thankful for this beautiful lady! I am clearly out of my league.

Throwing it back to when Big Glen, following his sparkler exit with his bride, Kailey, decided a few more runs through the sparklers would be the perfect encore! One of the best wedding moments this year :) I’ll blame the missed focus on the fact that I was crying from laughter... perfectly imperfect. #southernwedding #travel #destinationwedding #contax645 #film #keywest

One of my favorite images of this year :) Increasingly I find myself looking to the master photographers of previous generations for inspiration. Oh to channel an inner Robert Frank, Vivian Maier, Elliott Erwitt, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Brassai & countless others. Sometimes the most challenging aspect of photography is producing work that moves you personally while also meeting client expectations... to paraphrase what was said of photographer Andres Kertesz, “to be insatiably curious... while also having a precise sense of form.” #film #contax645 #southernwedding

God knew I needed Mollypop. In a world where it seems effortless to grow jaded, every day I get to wake up to Molly's smiling face as she twirls her way into our bedroom & casts a spell of optimism into my heart. I think she represents the best of me, or at the very least, I recognize & love her ability to always present her best self. She sees the world differently, although carefree & a bit naive, I love how she sees beauty in the simple things. Molly, my dear, you are cherished & we are happy to celebrate your 6th birthday today :) #mollypop #film #contaxt2

Groot Begijnhof, Leuven, Belgium // One of the largest remaining beguinages (a semi monastic community for women) in the Low Countries, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was one of my favorites locations due to the quiet, almost isolated streets that were so well preserved that they seemed like a movie set. I'm afraid more photos from this site will have to make an appearance :) #contax645 #film #belgium #leuven #grootbegijnhof

I think visiting Paris was a turning point in the way I viewed photography. It was there that I committed to primarily shooting film & where I realized a love for the master photographers of generations past. In 2013, I was fortunate to visit Paris to see our dear friends @parkerer9 & Lindsay (& 4 kiddos) to photograph their lives abroad. Joy & I have since visited them in London & this time next week we're going to see their new lives in Brussels, Belgium. I can't wait to once again visit Europe, see our friends & be enchanted by architecture & scenes that'll inspire future work. #film #contax645 #ilfordhp5 #paris #cityoflights #eiffeltower #toureiffel @richardphotolab

Our kids will probably talk about this for weeks. Our neighbor's yard & the road in front flooded. Thus, our kids designated it as the neighborhood pool & "swam" in it fully clothed :) It's the simple moments like these that I'll remember for the rest of my life.

Good morning, IG. I don't recall ever introducing myself. I'm Ben, a Wedding & Commercial photographer based out of East TN. On a given year I usually photograph in (give or take) 10 different states in the US as well as 1-2 commissions out of the country. I also teach as a professor at 2 Universities in Southeast TN in addition to taking on several consulting projects (ranging from organizational health to leadership, creative direction/marketing/branding, etc.) for both small businesses as well as larger companies. On a personal note, my amazing wife @joybfinch & I have 4 wonderful kiddos, Brennan (8), Knox (7), Molly (5) & Sawyer (2). Our life is very busy but filled with adventure. I would love to connect with you! I'm quite stoked to have a new photo taken by the very talented 📷 @rhianna_annadelores :) Thank you friend!

If you're lucky enough, you'll have neighbors who will become like family. This is Caylee; she is a Senior in HS at McMinn Central. Even though we recently sold our house, she & her family are still very dear to us. I'm honored to call them friends & lifelong "neighbors." #iphonepic #vsco #seniorpictures #portrait

Good evening, Instagram. I'm excited to share that I'll be speaking at the Southeast Photo Convention in Nashville, @southeastphotoconvention on February 16 & 17. I would be stoked to meet and learn alongside one another at what will be a fantastic event. I'll be sharing about how I've built my business to be simple yet sustainable, pure yet profitable. If you're interested in coming, use the code: FINCH before the rates increase on October 31. // Behind the image: When I photographed Stefan and Katie's wedding, it had only been a year since the death of Katie's grandfather. Following the first dance, Katie's father and uncles stepped into share a dance with their mother. It was a beautiful and pure moment I'll never forget. So incredibly touching. I will always insist on intentional, meaningful images over the seemingly routine & expected. #contax645 #southernwedding #filmshooter #film @photovisionprints

I've often found that my favorite time to be on the beach is when most have gone in for the day. I simply love the colors as the water begins to reflect a pinkish tone. On our summer trip to Saint Simons Island, I took the boys with me out to the beach and brought along my new point and shoot camera. It's a Contax T2 and shoots 35mm film. I'm stoked at the images it produces. I'll be sharing some personal photos this week taken with this camera. And I'm pretty sure it's going to be making special appearances at many weddings coming up :) #contaxt2 #film #seaisland #saintsimonsisland #beach #sunset #35mm

Ronak & Heena, moments before their reception. I recall being in Mumbai, India with @heenakabaria & @darlaywalker when we found this reception dress.

David & Kelsey's wedding went from the sunniest of weather to somewhat of a monsoon moments before the ceremony began. Just before the reception, the rain let up slightly for about 20 minutes so we snuck to the top of the ridge at @springtreefarms. I love that, despite the obstacles, they embraced the experience :) #southernwedding #portra #bride #love #jsasalon

Heena chose to blend her love for traditional Indian elements with a soft, somewhat pastel inspired palette of pinks, red & gold with a splash of green/blue. This photo was from her Mehndi ceremony @reserveatbbh & hands down one of the most beautiful saris ever :) Her wedding was one of the most beautiful occasions I've ever witnessed.

Sawyer, aka 'Linus,' wakes up every morning here at @joybfinch's parents' house wanting to ride on the golf cart. Here he is walking down the quiet road just before it ends at Papa & Nana's house.

It's the "little things" that I so desperately want to remember about my family... Such as the way Sawyer held his hands today as we rode on the golf cart. By noticing the subtleties, these are the moments I love to photograph. #theadventuresofsawyerfinch #lifestyle #love #vsco

What a day! Today we are celebrating our sweet daughter's birthday. Happy 5th to you, Miss Mollypop. You have no idea how happy you make your Dad. You make our family so fun & bring a little bit (maybe a lot) of girliness to our crew :) I snuck this pic of she & @joybfinch napping on a Sunday afternoon. In other news, we also moved out of our house. Such a bitter-sweet time as we await our new adventure (to be determined). #love #mollypop #contax645 #film #lifestyle @photovisionprints

The beautiful bride, Diane, from her The King and Prince resort wedding in St Simon's Island. It was a blast! The DJ at the reception said, "If you'd like a photo, go see Ben, he's the handsome white guy around here." Matter of fact, I was the only white guy. Ha! Yet I've never felt more at home :) #southernwedding #thekingandprince #stsimonsisland #contax645 #film #bride @photovisionprints

Been flying often lately. Trying to let my soul catch up with my body. @joybfinch & I made one of the hardest decisions to date when deciding to put our house on the market. Within 5 days we had a contract & are expected to close August 1. Now we're in the transition phase & have little clue what our next step will be. Seriously. However, we are confident that whatever is next is the start of something good & redemptive. Exciting times ahead! #flight #aviation #landscape #crosscountry #vsco

Elated to wish my sweet wife, @joybfinch, a very Happy Birthday :) Let's face it folks, I married way out of my league. Joy is an example of God's grace in each of her roles... Her gift of hospitality is rarely rivaled & she possesses a love for others that affects all who know her. To have her as a wife is a gift & a genuine joy. Though she would never admit it, she perfectly lives up to her name. This photo is from a recent Indian wedding at @castletonfarms :) Love you, babe. #happybirthday #love #film #contax645 @photovisionprints

The University Club, Tuscaloosa, AL // The end of March wrapped up my first time teaching "Film for the Modern Photographer" at the University of Tennessee. Hands down, it was one of my favorite teaching experiences to date;  I was honored to have some incredibly talented photographers attend. It made me think back to many years ago when I first fell in love with shooting film as I enjoyed the ability to slow down & curate more carefully the images I took. And for as far as I can recall I've found great joy in investing in other people. The opportunity to do both is enriching. Here's hoping for many more opportunities in the future to invest in fellow creatives! #film #creative #contax645

I was at home for lunch when I heard Sawyer in his room moments after waking from a nap. I pressed my ear to the door because I love to hear his sweet ramblings & melodies. I snuck in with my camera & as he caught me he quickly stood up & grinned, "Dada." // #lifestyle #home #love #theadventuresofsawyerfinch

Some of my favorite moments in India were spent in Ena Village where I communed in the fields with the workers, rode motorcycles, chatted with local business leaders & laughed embarrassingly out loud :) // #kodak_photo #india #contax645 #film #travelindia

There was something about the chaotic streets of India that reminded me that I am part of a much bigger story & that life is always richer when you live in community. #travelindia #film #contax645 #india #kodak_photo

Easily one of my favorites of @heenabipinpatel in India as we explored her family's village & farms. Simply perfect! #travel #travelindia #film #contax645 #indianwedding #indianbride #india

From a village outside of Surat, India. // What a great two days. Yesterday afternoon I received my film scans from India and I am so pleased with @photovisionprints work; they are top class professionals. This morning I had the opportunity to share about my trip with @abbyhamlambert on WBIR's Mornings with Fox 43 TV segment alongside @darlaywalker. And tonight I had the privilege of teaching a mobile photography class at The University of Tennessee accompanied by my dear friend, @coreywolfenbarger. Over the next few days I'm going to share a few of my favorite images from India and would love to hear your thoughts on your favorites. #india #travel #travelindia #film #contax645 #kodak_photo

A wonderful artist lunch featuring Tomory Dodge at Blackberry Farm today whose works is simply inspiring. Honored to be photographing the L'Amour du Vin event this weekend & honored to meet guest Vinter, Jamey Whestone of Whestone Wine Cellars. #blackberryfarm #knoxvillemuseumofart #lexusknoxville

Chicago, IL as seen from our departure // Approximately 8 years ago I attended a conference where the lead speaker stated, "According to the US Dept of Labor, Photography is the 2nd least successful business venture in the US." I sighed. Just weeks before I had quit my steady paying job in order to pursue photography & design full time. @joybfinch was pregnant with our first child & was quitting her teaching position & I desperately hoped not to be a statistic in that dreaded statement. 8 years later I feel the same sense of unrest as I hustle to make every photo better than the last & hope that every client feels as though they are part of my family. Today as I think about the last two weeks in India I am reminded that I am so fortunate. India changed my life & I am so thankful to Joy for supporting my ventures & believing that I'll always come back a better person. Tonight I'm teaching a class at The University of Tennessee & I'm hoping to help others realize their own dreams. It's in the exchange, the giving away of hard earned insight that makes it all worth it. #aerial #vsco #travel #theresafinchinindia #skyline

Heena walking the small trail lining her family's sugar cane fields. Had a wonderful, albeit short, inspiration shoot tonight of @heenabipinpatel in her family's village outside of Surat. #keepingupwiththekabarias #vsco #theresafinchinindia #travel #india #indianwedding #indianbride

It's scenes like this that make me realize how fortunate I am to photograph as my profession. I'm indebted to @heenabipinpatel & @rnkbr & their families for offering such a beautiful opportunity & experience. I will regularly look back upon these moments & these photos will instantly bring to mind sounds, smells & sentiments. I've decided that my next trip here I'll bring plenty of Polaroid film so that I can gift people photographs. I still have a few more days in India but it has genuinely changed my life. I'm humbled & grateful. #keepingupwiththekabarias #vsco #theresafinchinindia #travel #india #surat

One of my favorite days thus far in India. Spent the day with @heenabipinpatel's cousin, Parimal, in Ena Village & had a real taste of "normal" life. Parimal is a farmer so we visited his sugar cane & banana fields. This photo is of some of the laborers' home. They were so kind & had the most beautiful smiles. #india #travel #theresafinchinindia #vsco #keepingupwiththekabarias

An incredibly enjoyable evening last night in Chikhli. @heenabipinpatel's family friends hosted us in their home as well as kept their store open for several more hours to accommodate us. They were kind, generous & put on a clinic in hospitality. I've been humbled by their generosity. This is a view from the balcony in their home. #india #travel #theresafinchinindia #vsco #keepingupwiththekabarias #gujarat

This is from yesterday's visit to Don Bosco Snehalaya, a home for orphaned boys. It was easily one of my highlights of the trip. I love this pic of Heena enjoying the kiddos; their faces are radiant. When asked "Who is your best friend?" One boy responded saying, "They are all my best friends." What a wonderful heart! #gujarat #keepingupwiththekabarias #vsco #theresafinchinindia #travel #india
