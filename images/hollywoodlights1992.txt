No idea why they didn't make one for the heroes of the sequel trilogy, but shoutout to the awesome girlfriend for getting me a full set of the #StarWars #HotWheels cars they had at Walmart a few weeks ago. Finally got around to hanging them up and they look great! #geek

Decided I wanted a different Joy Contact grip for my #Nintendo #Switch (finally) so I made the plunge and picked up this #SuperMarioOdyssey one at Walmart tonight. Seems vastly more comfortable than the stock one, but a few hours of BotW should answer that once and for all. #geek #gamer

Yesterday I decided that it bad been a while since I picked up a new #game for my #NintendoSwitch. I had a rewards certificate at @levelup_entertainment so I figured, why not? After much internal debate, I decided to go with #XenobladeChronicles 2, my offical introduction to the #Xenogears franchise. I had this one on my list to check out for a while and based on the stats I've seen, it looks like a meaty game that will take some time to navigate all the way through (and that's before you factor in DLC). Looking forward to this journey! #jrpg #rpg #geek #gamer #Nintendo #xenobladechronicles2 #monolithsoft

Sometimes you have to #geek on the cheap. I was at Walmart today and decided to look at #toy clearance stuff. I've gotten lucky and managed to snag a few #StarWars Black Series figures before, either marked down on clearance or through seasonal toy stores closing down. Today was a different find though. Based on my research, this #KyloRen usually goes for about $35. It's the Episode VIII (The Last Jedi) Throne Room figure. It's packed a bit differently than all of my other black series (it's a large box with a front flap) so I'm not sure how I'm going to display it just yet. But for only $7 I couldn't pass on this one. They only had 2 at the Walmart I was at (Tuckerton) and another gentlemen already had one in his hands. Needless to say I snatched it up, in the off chance he was going to buy both with hopes of flipping one online. If I can just procure myself a Poe figure now, I'll have one figure for each of the MAJOR characters in the sequel triology. I already have a Force Awakens Finn and Last Jedi Rey. Sometimes it's nice being a casual #collector.

#Hawkeye Vol 1 - My Life as a Weapon is a pretty sick read. I'm starting to make my way through my comic and graphic novel backlog and I'm really making some progress. Read through #DoctorStrange The Oath last night and now this. Next up in line is #Deadpool Back in Black. One thing I'm noticing is that, at least for the time being, my preference leans towards #Marvel, with the occasional #Batman or #WonderWoman story thrown in. Guess #Avengers had a bit of an effect on me. #comicbooke #graphicnovel #tradepaperback #geek

I had a lot of fun seeing #Avengers Infinity War last night. For me, this film was an event a decade in the making and I made the most of my night. I switched my watch face to an Infinity Stone face, I got the collectable cup, topper, and popcorn tub. I even made sure to grab the Movie I'll (a cool new #AR experience that @regalmovies does now). If you haven't seen it, I highly suggest getting out there to see it now. Incredibly excited to catch it a second time soon. #Marvel #InfinityWar #Spiderman #movie #geek #comicbooks

@booksamillion brought back the bargain graphic novels section at my local store in full force. There's no way this wasn't going to happen. And yes, more trips will be happening. That being said, I admit that I'm a horrible #comic collector. I like the stories. I like the art. I like the writing. As such, I put less emphasis format, leading to my collection being spread out among bookshelves, long boxes, and my comixology account. Sometimes for the same series or story. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm someone who wants to read a lot of good stories and is less concerned about how I have them, but I have to be financially sensible. #bargainhunter.

I decided to pick this up a few months ago. The first 6 #Megaman X games on one disc. For anyone wondering, this is why #Capcom is releasing the Megaman X Collection. Usually this happens with movies for me, so it's nice to have it happen with a game for a change.

"Tell me why I love you like I do..." My mother always was watching #MadAboutYou when I was a kid. There was a time I was too young to care about the show, but she eventually had a few seasons on DVD. They grew on me. I recently heard Helen Hunt say during an appearance on James Cordon, that Paul Reiser and her have been discussing the potential for a revival. Where are the characters now? What are they doing? And do people care? I care deeply. And it got me thinking that it's been a while since I've watched the show. During a trip to Wal-Mart last night, I decided to pick up the Complete Series, released by #MillCreek. It's gonna take some time to make my way through all 164 episodes (7 seasons) from start to finish, but I'm looking forward to it. Joining me on the journey is @karabearxx who has never seen the show before. I ventured through the first 11 epsiodes with her and she loved it. I'm very pleased with this. Really looking forward to making my through all the great stories, moments, and guest stars. #sitcom #90s #90stv #FinalFrontier

I love the little things. I have a replica of the #hoverboard from #BackToTheFuture that I picked up from @lootcrate Vault a little while back. The other day I was dusting it with a microfiber cloth when I noticed a little circle that looked like something was missing. My first through was "I just fucked up!" but after a moments thought, I smiled. I didn't jack anything up. The company that made this went to the extent of adding in the detail of the area where #MartyMcFly ripped the handlebars off the girls hoverboard in #BTTF Part 2. God I love attention to detail. #geek #classic

I can't say I've been a big enough fan of the #MadMax series to justify buying the High Octane Collection but I'm proud to say that after a bit of searching, I've managed to snag all 3 Mel Gibson installments on Blu Ray. In regards to Fury Road, I opted to buy it on iTunes when it was on sale for $10 because it had both the theatrical and Black and Chrome editions of the film. #movie #bluray #collection #classic

So for some reason, unbeknownst to me, a 2 pack of @oreo #cookies is now a thing. My question is why? The owner of said cookies said it's a snack, but I can't recall ever craving a snack that minimal. A snack is 6 #Oreos, minimum.

Here's something I really appreciate @chegg609 for: one of my go to drinks at restaurants (and in my day to day life) is #MtnDew…it makes me happy that when I order a Mtn Dew there, they use the throwback variety that's made with real sugar. Sometimes it's the little things that make me happy. #yum #soda

Today is really just an experimental day. I'm starting to play around with (and I'm using this term loosely) a #Bokeh and depth of field type effects. I know there's apps that can be bought that really create the effect but I want to see what I can pull off in camera and with my usual workflow. Any tips? #photography #iphoneography #shotoniPhone #bell #hotel

I had trouble picking what my main #photo I shared of today was gonna be. I decided to make it this one. I took this photo in Cape May, NJ in a location know. As sunset beach. I didn't do anything dance, just put my phone right behind some small piles of sand and snapped a quick pick. For the editing, I used the app #Camera+ by TapTapTap, specifically the "Sunset" scene. I applied that to quite a few #sunset photos I've taken and I really like effect it has. I also used the #iOS Photos app to ever-so-slightly bump up the light level on the shadows so you can see the sand and gravel just a bit better. Overall, I love the composition of this photo though. #iphoneography #photography #beach #water #ocean #atlanticocean #shotoniPhone #naturephotography #sunset #boat #birds

I was at Goodwill the other day and they had a few of these in different colors, styles, and brands. None of them appeared to be in good enough shape that would justify me getting one, but I got nostalgic for a minute as I held one in my hand and remembered all the nights I'd listen to mine and fall asleep listening to an #Elvis concert I had on CD from 1972. #music #nostalgia #CD #Discman #CompactDisc #retro

I can't tell you how good this feels after all these years. I've always loved the #HarryPotter series since I was a child. When I was growing up, my mother was nice enough to buy them for me. There's one book that never got purchased though: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's a long story but the short version is for the last 10 years I've had a complete set, minus that one book. Today I was at a local thrift store and I stumbled upon a copy of the book for $1, an American First Edition (though not first printing) which fits in with my collection quite nicely. It's work in almost the same way mine are from years of traveling too and from school in backpacks and messenger bags, save for some marker marks on the outside, not the inside. Regardless, I couldn't be happier to have a complete set of one of my favorite series!

If I'm gonna read some #comics in my down time it may as well be on my #iPad. Don't get me wrong, I love physical books but #comixology and an iPad really give a great digital experience. On a side note, this may be my favorite #Avengers cover yet—issue #5. Not only does it have founding members #IronMan, #Thor, #Hulk (aka #IncredibleHulk), #GiantMan (aka #AntMan), and #Wasp, it also includes #CaptainAmerica (viewed by many as a founding Avenger despite not entering the series until issue #4. Loving reading through the great #StanLee stories of the 1960's! #geek #digitalcomics #Marvel #marvelmasterworks

Well that was a nice surprise today. When I packed away some of my #DVD collection I forgot to note what movies wound up in which boxes. Luckily, the box I was going through today had my #IronMan DVD in it. This is the only movie in the #Marvel Cinematic Universe that I don't own on #bluray and aside from a video quality upgrade, I can't think of much of a reason to get the blu ray. This is the 2 disc Ultimate Edition so it's loaded with bonus content, including 2 documentaries that I'm looking forward to watching when I get off work tonight: I Am Iron Man and The Invincible Iron Man. #geek #movie #MCU #robertdowneyjr #IAmIronMan

Should I read one more #Avengers comic book before bed? Probably not. I have an early day tomorrow. Am I going to anyway? Hell yes! #comicbook #comicbooks #Marvel #MarvelComics #Hulk #IncredibleHulk #submariner #ironman #antman #wasp #thor #giantman #marvelmasterworks #comixology

12,300…not bad considering how long it's been since I've played this game. #DrMario #SNES #NES #puzzle #geek #videogame #retro

Now seems like as good of a day as any to watch some #Batman from the 1960's. Rest In Peace #AdamWest… #RIP #Geek #DCComics #Batman66

I asked for a few packets of #Diablo sauce at #TacoBell. Guess I'll be able to start stockpiling them now.

@kirkhammett's #Dracula guitar. The photo was too blurry to share on its own but I was able to turn it into a work of art. #guitar #metal #metallica #orionfest

I think sometimes we all need a reminder just how human #Batman is. I've been reading the #Knightfall story arc and I'm really enjoying it. The first chunk is called #BrokenBat and it features this iconic image of #Bane breaking #TheDarkKnight. The story is very enjoyable, very well written, and has fantastic art. #GothamCity #geek #comicbook #comixology

It's not every day that I get excited about taking a photo of an #Apple but I couldn't help myself this time. This apple was so red that it looked like a work of #art was pulled out of a painting and placed in the break room fridge. That doubled up beautiful with a a brown shelf and a nice blue wall to create an image I'm quite proud of. #iphoneography #photography

Batman lives or Batman dies. Only one things for certain; Azrael decides. I got sucked into the photo mode of #Batman #ArkhamKnight the other day as I went back to revisit the game for the first time in a while. I decided I really liked this shot I took. #dccomics #Azrael #Gotham #GothamCity #ClockTower #Batcave #geek #gamer #screenshot #videogamephotography
