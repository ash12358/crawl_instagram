May 8 is a holiday that commemorates the end of World War II and the French people's freedom from the Nazis. It was Charles de Gaulle who announced the end of World War II in France on May 8, 1945. French citizens and organizations placed flower arrangements with the colors of the French flag (such as this one) at the foot of statues and monuments in honor of the soldiers who perished during the war. President Fran√ßois #Hollande himself presented a flower arrangement to the statue of General de Gaulle located at L'Arc de Triomphe. #Paris #flag #photojournalism

#Newspaper #photojournalism #newpope #PopeFrancis . Smart choice of photograph for the front page of French newspaper @lemondefr. The photo shows Pope Francis I as he bowed to the crowds in St. Peter‚Äôs Square and humbly asked for their blessing on his first appearance. The caption read: "Rome, March 13. The new leader of the Church in front of the crowd, making a unique gesture." The front page further read: "The Pope of New Horizons: Under the name of Francis, the Argentine Jorge Bergoglio is the first South-American to lead the Church. He incarnates a profound change in Catholicism." In taking the name Francis, the new pope drew connections to the 13th century St. Francis of Assisi, who saw his calling as trying to rebuild the simple spirit of the church and devote his life to missionary journeys.

"#Obama: The best is yet to come," reads the front page of French #newspaper Le Monde, featuring a photograph of a smiling president during a visit to Chicago on Nov. 7, 2012. The paper was delivered to news kiosks in Paris beginning at 12:30 pm, and was selling out quickly, according to Jamel, the owner of a kiosk in the 15th arrondissement, who said to me "I admire your president. I am happy he won."

Thousands of Fran√ßois Hollande's supporters, known as ''People of the Left,' rejoiced at Place de la Bastille in Paris until past 1 a.m. Monday night as he became France's first Socialist president in 17 years.
