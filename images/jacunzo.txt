Introducing EXCEPTIONS, a new docu-series I‚Äôm hosting & producing with @heydrift. It‚Äôs about why the world‚Äôs best in B2B are betting on brand after decades of conventional thinking to the contrary. I go inside companies like @invisionapp @gustohq Zoom @wistia @helpscoutofficial and more. (This series is only available inside Seeking Wisdom, Drift‚Äôs podcast channel.

We get so outraged and consumed by this thing and all the apps in it. I‚Äôm more guilty than most. All it takes is a glance in any other direction and your day gets so much better.

#tbt to one of my favorite stages ever (in Nashville, June 2017, with PrismHR). July is totally void of speaking for me most years, so I work on lots of bigger projects requiring deep work. This year‚Äôs that‚Äôs my book! Break the Wheel arrives this fall. (I‚Äôm also launching a new docu-series I‚Äôm hosting and producing with a company you‚Äôll recognize. Can‚Äôt wait for that!)

#tbt You never know when one small thing can snowball into a lot of bigger, better things. This is me on stage at Content Marketing World 2015. No event represents a domino effect of small action amounting to big things like #CMWorld. Here‚Äôs what I mean... . . (1) In 2013, I agreed to speak at an event for a colleague who couldn‚Äôt make it anymore. (2) There, I saw @joepulizzi speak & decided to introduce myself. We hit it off. He invited me to write for @cmicontent‚Äôs blog, which (3) I did. Several times. (4) That led to me submitting an idea for a talk to CMW‚Äô14. They knew my work and liked my idea, so I was accepted to speak. . . (5) Because they look at audience ratings, I was invited back the next year. They bumped me to a bigger room given my ratings. (6) I spoke that year, pictured above. (7) my ratings again earned me a bigger room, this time alongside @JayBaer @drewdavishere @annhandley & other friends I admire and learn from every week. I always thought those folks got the big stage because they have big reach. In truth? They have bigger work ethics. They‚Äòre hungry and bust their tails all year. They just don‚Äôt brag about the ‚Äúhustle‚Äù like some people. They just do their work and treat others well as they do so. (8) My rating that year, in 2016, topped all speakers. (Humblebrag, hold the humble. Gimme one moment alright?!) That earned me the main stage and opening keynote for the whole event last year. (9) that 2017 speech has led to one whirlwind year for me in the best way. 2018 has been hard but meaningful. . I‚Äôm SO early in my career and I work a TON. Probably too much. But to anyone who looks at ANYONE else‚Äôs career and wonders how they got there, while I can only speak to my path, I have a hunch it‚Äôs a lot less than you think. It‚Äôs one little action leading to another, being kind and working hard the entire time. But it‚Äôll never happen without tipping that domino. . . My advice, for whatever it‚Äôs worth: Find one small action that somewhat scares you, and take it. Now. You‚Äôll be shocked at where it can lead.

Under no circumstances should children be separated from their parents in the manner they are right now inside the United States of America. End of discussion. I‚Äôm furious at our leaders for their lack of immediate and unrelenting response, and right now, that means the GOP. Get them out. They don‚Äôt deserve to be called leaders or hold office. They don‚Äôt deserve our trust. They don‚Äôt deserve to call themselves Christians.

This one hurts. We lost an all-time great storyteller today. I saw him speak twice. I model a lot of my projects after his work. He made you feel deep, important things with his words. He told powerful stories pulled out from the seemingly routine lives of others. Watching his work, I'd sit there, mouth hanging open, moved to my very bones. This is just...devastating. To me, the name ‚ÄúParts Unknown‚Äù reflects Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs gift: going deeper inside a person‚Äôs, a profession‚Äôs, or a location‚Äôs day-to-day to find something bigger & more meaningful. THOSE were the unknown and pleasantly unexpected parts that only he seemed willing to look for with every story he told. This is the worst of news, but if you‚Äôre a creator: honor this man by redoubling your efforts. Rest in peace, Anthony Bourdain. I hope the world benefits from your words for generations to come.

Help me pick the cover art! ‚û°Ô∏è Leave a comment with your fave ‚ô•Ô∏è I‚Äôve narrowed this down to the following 3.

#tbt to yet another time my hands became basically my closed captioning. #Italian . Next week, I‚Äôm heading to Nashville to speak at @emmaemail‚Äôs Marketing United together with @melrobbinslive @schmittastic @allen, Mike McAvoy from the Onion, and many others. Doing something I haven‚Äôt done before: critiquing my own speech during the speech. There‚Äôs a broader point, but I‚Äôm definitely breaking the 4th wall. Tried it with a few audiences so far and it seemed to work, so I‚Äôm expanding the bit. We‚Äôll see how this goes. I can‚Äôt wait! . Just...please don‚Äôt make me tie my hands down?

#tbt to the last speech I gave in Boston. Already have two scheduled there this year! Pumped. (Also, while most venues are corporate and bland, this theater in the South End was amazing.

A look at my podcasting setup. Companies think they need to build state of the art studios & buy tons of tech to make a great show. You don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the wizard, not the wand. Always. Pay your creative talent better. The rest takes care of itself.

This is a story from my time at Google. It isn't pretty. Some context first... . . I was in my early-20s, but despite that fact, thanks to the logo on my business card, marketing executives and practitioners alike thought I knew something when I arrived to their offices to sell them on new AdWords features and campaigns. And I suppose I did know something: I knew what worked "on average." As for what would might work for my specific clients? That was something I couldn‚Äôt tell them. I just prayed that those questions never came. When they didn‚Äôt, I was grateful at the time, but now I wonder: Why didn‚Äôt they? Why didn‚Äôt my clients start their thinking by considering their own context first, and then make sense of this new trend, given what they knew to be true about their own businesses?. . . Instead, clients conflated what works IN GENERAL with what would work FOR THEM. In under a year, millions of businesses had adopted this new feature I talk about in the story below. Google had activated its massive reach and unleashed legions of charismatic salespeople (and also me) upon their clients, and they simply brute-forced a new trend into existence. So why did this thing become a best practice? . . Because Google wanted it to be. . . Read more at unthinkablemedia.com/blog

Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to be a person who has thoughts and shares them for a living because, well, I find a lot of those kinds of people redundant or chock full of Grade-A baloney. Guess I‚Äôll have to work hard to make sure I‚Äôm more of the prosciutto di Parma type...

#fbf to the coolest venue I‚Äôve ever given a speech in. This is an old factory building-turned-event venue in Utrecht, about 40 minutes outside Amsterdam. Utrecht is an unbelievable city. My wife and I fell in love with it. She took this photo during my tech check before I opened the event. (That‚Äôs me reviewing the section about @deathwishcoffee) So freaking cool in there!

Creators who care are the best part about the internet. When someone is willing to put in extra work to make that last 2% of something great, it makes the whole experience worth your time. Despite pressure to be ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù from others, makers who are willing to take on that little time debt, that little moment of watching others ship commodities while they ship nothing and edit or improve instead ‚Äî THAT is the difference between average and exceptional work.

Fact: I get more done and see more results when I‚Äôm not constantly trying to document what I‚Äôm doing. ‚Äî Fact: People who actually work hard don‚Äôt have time to talk for hours and hours about how hard they work. ‚Äî Fact: It‚Äôs fine to motivate yourself by watching ‚Äúgurus‚Äù who scream and shout things like, ‚ÄúHustle!‚Äù But unless you turn that revved motor loose on your actual work, it‚Äôs the racing equivalent of running in place. #hustle #entrepreneurship #startups #tech #siliconvalley #nyctech #influencer #socialmedia #makersgonnamake #creativity

Too far to the left, and you won‚Äôt get paid. üëàüëâ Too far to the right, and you‚Äôll churn out whatever crap you assume will work (hello, clickbait). ü§û But find the overlap of what you love creating and what others love receiving, and man, oh man, you‚Äôve got a career. üí™üèª Finding that overlap may be a lifelong journey, but the moments where you feel you‚Äôve found it?

The #Podcasting Order of Priorities. When someone asks me about how to podcast, I ask if they‚Äôre any good on a microphone. Most say they‚Äôve never stopped to consider that. But...but BEING ON A MICROPHONE IS WHAT PODCASTING IS! It‚Äôs like that pickup basketball player who has all the gear and no game at all. Can you play? That‚Äôs the fundamental part. The 99% of it. Start there. (And yet, everyone obsesses over that last question. That‚Äôs incremental, people!) #creativity #makersgonnamake #podcast

We‚Äôre talking to people from startups to big cos, authors to TED speakers, about how treating people like mere pieces of an org chart is dead and why empowering others ‚Äî especially those closest to customers ‚Äî is the path to thriving teams.

(Link in bio.) @waitbutwhy is an epic blog and, even better, Tim Urban is artistically thoughtful and strategic about his art generating a result. We undervalue the emotional responses of others about our work and overvalue topline vanity metrics. We play to algorithms instead of people in order to be discoverable. But the point is to be memorable. Funny how addressing that first makes the other things easier. #amwriting #blogging #creativity #makersgonnamake #entrepreneurship #makermovement

It‚Äôs the season finale of Unthinkable! Featuring @waitbutwhy. Link in bio or listen in your #podcast player of choice. // ABOUT THIS EPISODE: In the Season 3 finale of Unthinkable, it's time for a story and a battle -- a story about a runaway creative success that flies in the face of conventional thinking and a battle that all of us face whenever we aspire to be better than average in our careers. Finally, at long last, we blame one dastardly demon for our nasty habit of always taking the easy way out, the accepted route forward. Finally, we enter the battle within, and things get hairy. Luckily, Tim Urban from Wait But Why is here to help. Well. Kinda. It's Unthinkable.

Latest #podcast! (Link in bio) Swipe for a quote ‚û°Ô∏è ABOUT THIS EPISODE: How does your intent for your work change your results? If your goal is to build something big, does that increase the odds? Why, then, do so many stories about huge successes start out the same way: with a shrug, and a quick, "I just wanted to brew some beer." ? Today, we explore the story of The Alchemist, makers of the industry sensation, Heady Topper.

Today I turn 32! I still feel like this little guy. He wanted to be an ‚Äúanimal seller‚Äù (pet store owner). Over time, that changed to architect, sports journalist, and many other things.

New #podcast! Suzy Batiz had sworn off starting companies. NEVER AGAIN, she thought. But one sniff and one conversation later, she was obsessed. Her curiosity took over, and a decade later, she's built a 300-million-dollar empire. And all of it started by trying to solve a problem none of us care to even think about, let alone build a career around. It's Unthinkable.

Photo credit:  @brittanypalmerphoto // WHAT A YEAR! This was my final speech of 2017 (thanks to the awesome team at @unitedfresh #BrandStorm). In my first full year of keynote speaking, i spoke to 4000 content marketers at #CMWorld, and 400 fire chiefs in Toronto. I talked to dentists, startup founders, trucking industry marketers, and podcasters.  I rehearsed a million times, and tweaked a million slides. I got to trot around the US and Canada to help people trust their intuition at work to become the exception to all the conventional thinking in their space. This year was truly, well, unthinkable üòâüôèüèª Thanks to all who supported me throughout the year! And i promise to be better next year. Onward!

New Unthinkable episode is live! Here‚Äôs some context ‚û°Ô∏è Unsurprisingly, one of the catchiest songs ever created topped the iTunes charts. It beat epic songs by Rihanna and Drake and narrowly missed topping Adele and even Gangnam Style. Away from the charts, this song sparked a global movement -- merchandise and microsites, mobile games and parodies galore. One song and one video, going crazy viral, and snowballing into something much larger than itself. And while none of that seems all that surprising in our digital world today, when you learn about who created this song -- and the insanity that ensued -- it'll seem like unlikely. You might even call it ... Unthinkable.

New post on the blog (link in bio). // Last week, I wrote something that could be in the running for this year's Most Obvious Written Statement Award -- a glorious night where I dress my dog in a tux and hand myself a bottle of bourbon while a string quartet plays me out of my apartment. (#tradition) Here's what I wrote: No two [situations] are exactly the same. That bourbon is as good as mine! Because, uh, YEAH, no kidding. Every situation is at least sliiiiightly different than the rest. Duh. (Do we still say "duh"? I don't care. That statement was so obvious, I'm bringing it back just this once.) basic.gif My point was, those sliiiight differences actually make ALL THE DIFFERENCE. Unfortunately, we have this mental barrier that's been built up over time that must come down before we can really see our situation as unique and find our answers within that uniqueness. The problem isn't that we believe our context is identical to others. The problem is how we locate the differences. So let's first smash down that wall blocking our view. That wall is made up of two issues: We only notice differences that are OBVIOUS ... and we only point to differences as EXCUSES. We're getting too theoretical though. Hit the link in the bio to see what I mean in practical terms.

Ever get annoyed at the shortcut culture built on ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and the business world‚Äôs obsession with it? Relax, you‚Äôre in good company. Here‚Äôs something I wrote about that. Full story in bio. ‚úíÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Best practices can‚Äôt account for the variables of our own unique situations, and so at best, they provide approximations or estimates. They create AVERAGE work and results. And while the expert can‚Äôt possibly know the details of our situation, we certainly can. If we understood our context, we could use those details to make the best possible decisions for us, in our specific situation. And we could get increasingly skilled at doing this, until our decision-making seems almost instant -- that's the power of intuition. The people we admire as "geniuses" seem to have that instant clarity generator in their back pocket. That's because they've honed their intuition for awhile, so what they do feels magical. But it‚Äôs not. They just understand their own context better than we do. But now I‚Äôm wondering: What IS our context? See bio link for more!

All-time favorite #quote. This is the sticker on my laptop üí™üèªüòù. One of the reasons I focus my #podcast and keynote speeches on intuition is that's what makes you the only one who does what you do. My show started with a simple premise: bring together people who are bothered by rote, soulless work in the business world. It's turned into a group exploration of what it really takes to trust intuition -- what it really means to do exceptional work through your own thoughts, not some genetic best practice. To be exceptional, you have to be an exception. You have to be the ONLY one that does what you do. Thanks to intuition, you are. The question is: Do you use that? . . . . #creativity #makers #makersgonnamake #amwriting #entrepreneurship #hustle #startups #tech #podcastlife #motivation #inspiration #creativeinspiration #gratefuldead #music

Excerpt from this week's Unthinkable newsletter. Link in bio to read it all and subscribe! üëåüèª ‚û°Ô∏èVisualizing IntuitionüëÄ How great are those moments where, suddenly, you just know? The idea strikes. The answer arrives. The path forward is suddenly illuminated with floodlights and neon signs and three friends jumping up and down screaming, "THIS WAY!" ... plus that one friend who still won't stop staring at his phone. (I see you, LARRY! DON'T EXPECT AN INVITE TO BE PART OF MY NEWSLETTER STORIES NEXT TIME!) Freaking Larry. My point is, few things feel better than those moments where confusion suddenly gives way to clarity. That's the power of your intuition. Intuition is like an instant clarity generator. üí™üèª But unfortunately, it doesn't always generate that clarity when we need it most. Those moments where we suddenly know aren't consistent. More often than not, the idea DOESN'T strike, and we don't know how to make sure it does. The answer DOESN'T arrive, and we don't know how to hasten it. The floodlights are off, the neon signs are broken, and every single one of your friends is sitting next to Larry, staring at their phones. Freaking. Larry. So here's my question this week: How do we find clarity faster?

üî• New Unthinkable #podcast cover #art! ‚¨áÔ∏è Read on for the explanation of the various parts. . . . The Emerson passage is in the background, conveying meaning and hopefully stoking curiosity enough to search for that passage yourself (it's well worth the read -- SO powerful). I also love how it gives a more urban feel to the image when set on a cracked gray background. The hands of conventional thinking grab and claw from below, trying desperately to disrupt our aspirations to do better work. The tilted frame in the middle show the damage done by conventional thinking. Even while we aspire to do great work (the paint splats above, the Unthinkable lightbulb), we are influenced by the world, past and present. The tilted frame-within-a-frame also came last, after I finished watching the HBO doc The Defiant Ones. Podcast art is limited to the dimensions given to you -- unless you decide to be a bit "defiant" WITHIN those dimensions. Taken on the whole, the image is a bit confusing and messy. Because that's life. There are no neat lists of tips and tricks in reality. There is no ONE way. There's just a ton of hard work, done with the right intent, despite the forces around us that tell us otherwise. It's Unthinkable.

Command center. It's amazing how many people in business think creating a high quality podcast (or any project) requires big budgets and expensive tech. I've never seen that do anything but cause delays in producing the work. For the first time ever, I have a home office with a simple setup. I spent $200 on equipment (shure mic, Alesis multimix, and a cheap mic stand), found free tools online, and have never seen the need to upgrade. Complaining about budgets and lack of tech is an excuse. It's 2017. It has never been easier to hack together something. The REAL key is working on your craft. If you're a creator and agonize over those skills instead of the other noise, you're unstoppable.

Such a cool idea! Blind date with a book. You get the genre and nothing more. In the era of algorithms suggesting everything based on personal preference, this just feels refreshing and new üëåüèª

Monday evening sky over Lake Placid. This is my week off before the most important 2-month stretch of my career: 8 keynotes in 8 weeks (potentially 10 depending on how things break üò±)...new podcast season...new partnerships...and a whole lot more. If all goes well and all the work pays off, this could be an inflection point towards what I aspire to do: create the world's most powerful stories about the meaning we find in work. Speaking and my podcast are amazing, but I can't wait to launch new web shows across the emotional spectrum. Here goes nothing. 5Ô∏è‚É£ 4Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£ üöÄ

New background on my computer. I've always been fascinated by people who point to their work and say, "I can't be creative because I'm not (insert reason here)" Somewhere along the way, "creativity" became synonymous with "radical" or "big." But the people (and ducks) who I find most creative are just slightly different than everything around them. In other words, you don't need to do anything crazy or huge. You just gotta do you.

This painting sits above my desk in my home office. It's a reminder that if you do you, you have a lot more room to move than if you conform to the convention. My industry experiences (marketing, tech, media) are fraught with conventional wisdom in the form of blog posts and tweets and pithy quotes from self-proclaimed experts. It all seeks to keep you in the same lanes as everyone else. But this is the Internet. It's a big, wide ocean out there! The sheer possibility of it all is staggering and exciting. And it's just beyond that tiny wall. So you can have your lanes and your best practices and your proven methods. Give me the open ocean any day.

I have no idea what I wanna be when I grow up. And I've never loved my work more. I'm a traveler. I love being a speaker, writer & podcaster because of the sheer possibility of it all.

Here at Grado Labs in Brooklyn. Working on a new story for Unthinkable. Loving this one! Grado is a family-run business that makes incredible HAND-MADE headphones. They often use wood in the design as the housing, including a partnership I learned about with the makers of Wild Turkey whiskey (they used wood from the barrels). Grado does ZERO advertising (not even a name on their door) and is beloved by artists like Neil Young, John Mayer, and even George Martin, writer for the Beatles. This episode will launch in our upcoming season about conventional thinking and those who dare to question it. Link in bio or subscribe to Unthinkable in your podcast player of choice.
