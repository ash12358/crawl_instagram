Final pics from our Mendocino girls trip with Mom. After we packed up, we went exploring and @alia_mallorie found this hidden arch then we went down past Point Arena to Bowling Ball Beach before heading home. This was a fantastic three days! We are so grateful that my mom wanted to spend this time with us and is still up for a good hike! 🌾👭👭

The graduation festivities are over and I’m grateful her future is bright and she’s had the ultimate college experience. She got an excellent education and is ready to change the world one middle school student at a time!

Had such a great time with @gelmoment today! I was inspired by their culture of sisterhood and service and how everyone truly cares about each others’ success, unconditionally.

We worked at the @redwood_empire_food_bank tonight. He’s 14 now and could go alone but it’s fun to do it together. I’m glad he agrees! Bagging 5lb bags of apples this time.  They always need help so if you’re local, sign up! 🌳🍎🍏#volunteer #sonomacounty

Some people have asked me what I used to do when I was in direct sales myself. I did this. 💕 It was such a great business as a mom! This is the business that took off in the very early years of internet marketing when I realized you could really connect online across the miles, when others in the industry were not doing that yet.  I miss these times when the kids were young.  They are a product of this product!

Our baby girl Roxie the doxie is near the end of her days. This is how she spends most of her time, curled up next to one of us in her diaper and blankie. Her legs no longer work but her heart is still so full of love for her family! When we got her she was already up there in age but the past 4 or 5 years we’ve gotten to love her so much, even as we watched her slow down and gray. She’s the sweetest thing ever and we are all going to miss her. 💕🐶💔 #seniorpetsofig #doxie #doxiesofinstagram

Some of the 8th graders have spent two nights backpacking and camping out in Little Yosemite Valley. Now they’re hiking back down to the main camp area in what used to be called Curry Village.

This shirt marks a very special milestone for me! I earned it from @santarosajazzercise because I participated in 150 classes in 2017! With all the travel I do for my Biz and the expeditions I go on with the middle school that is a very big accomplishment! I wasn’t sure if I’d make it but I did with plenty of time to spare. :) Love having @jazzerciseinc in my life!! 💪🏻🙂🎼

Enjoying Southern California with my boy and his classmates this week! It’s quite an adventure!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5082c69d74365e6cb60e784b460f9e51/5BEB4EB6/t51.2885-15/e35/23498279_129793561053418_5062052174507278336_n.jpg
Our hillside is burnt, homes have disintegrated, life paths are changed, souls were lost and our security has been shaken. Will it ever be the same again? Here in Rohnert Park the town came close but was not directly affected like they were to the east and north but the sorrow is still here. Most of us know many people who lost literally everything but the clothes on their backs and even more who were evacuated for weeks or without power or water, kids displaced, jobs lost, pets still wandering lost, businesses we all knew and loved gone forever. It’s been a little over a month and every time I drive by the site of the Crane Canyon fire I pray for peace for all our survivors and the families of those whose lives were lost. May God bless Northern California with a wet and fruitful winter and spring and inspire the continued love and support from communities around the world as everyone looks forward to rising from the ashes to rebuild.❤️ #sonomastrong #sonomacounty #rohnertpark

Airport reading. A topic I’m quite interested in especially regarding how it pertains to social media use and the direct selling profession in general.  I also like shorter anthologies. Give me the highlights, thanks! 📘💡👓

My baby boy is at Lassen Volcanic National Park with his class this week and I could not go due to some upcoming travel. 🇦🇺 One of the chaperones took this picture and I just love it. I was feeling a little guilty that I could not attend and that I’m going to be gone when he comes home as well… I’m sure he’s doing fine, but I miss him even more because of that! 💔 So grateful that other parents were willing and able to take the week off to spend with these awesome middle schoolers. 💕 I’m not going to see him for three weeks. 😢#toughchoices #family #travels

Gratuitous mom brag... I just love how cute he is! ❤️ I'm glad he doesn't have social media because he'd be mortified but he's having a great year so far and really working hard to go above and beyond in his school work. I like 13 y/o and 8th grade so far! Hope he stays sweet too. Who knew my boy would be the huggy one? Moms of boys know this secret, I hear. 💕 #mombrag #parenting

These two beauties went to Jazzercise with me this morning! They're both home only a month before one heads off to study in Australia and the other starts her summer camp job. I'm happy to spend any time I can get with them while I can! 💗👯👟

I'm here because my daughter @fallonns needed to get her archery certification in advance of her Girl Scout camp job this summer… It's so quiet and peaceful here I'm tempted to just take a nap under a tree! Although there is the problem of the announcer from the rifle range nearby coming across the loudspeaker every once in a while…not to mention gunshots!

The other day I was able to go out with some ladies from the original Direct Selling networking group in my area. We were the Movers and Shakers and later became the first DSWA chapter in the Bay Area when there was a chapter program. We were the most successful group in California and made such great memories! Even tho most of us are no longer in the field there's a special bond among direct selling sisters you just don't get anywhere else! If you ever have a chance to network and support others cross-company, do it! ❤️💛💚💙💜

I got my baby back!! After 6 days away at Yosemite he came back a changed kid! I've never heard him speak like he is tonight about the beauty he saw and all the challenges he overcame! He gave it a 9.5/10 and he can't wait for next year and backpacking as an 8th grader! 🙂😊😀

Can someone explain this to me? When you put a full cup of water into a hotel coffee maker and it comes out like this. Where does the rest of the water go? It's not in the coffee maker! Is it really using that much in steam? Why can't I get a full cup… lol 🤷🏼‍♀️☕️

I'm trying out the new multiple photos post on Instagram. What do you think? For those of you with businesses do you think this will be useful? It will be kind of nice to have the ability to post several pictures at the same time without filling up somebody's feed and being annoying. LOL For business or travel! 👍🏻

If you get love notes from your customers on your social media pages, print them out! Thanks to a suggestion from my coach @debbieternes I collected all of mine for 2016 and and put them in a pretty box in my office to review when I need a boost! Thanks to all who took the time to express themselves this year. It means so much to me! 💗

One of my favorite parts of Christmas - having @fallonns join us by FaceTime from Amsterdam. I don't think I could survive her being away so long without technology! She returns on the 13th and I can't wait! 🎄

Ableskivers on our annual family camping reunion. It's our Danish heritage tradition, tho I hear they usually don't eat them for breakfast? These are lemon curd filled. Yum! 😍

Moving this one into the dorms today! For the first time she will have her own car so I get to ride with her there while Greg takes the truck. No more driving to and fro to get her for holidays etc. but I'll miss our car time! Sophomore year here we go! 📚💕🚗

Missing my girl, but so proud of her! I don't know if I can handle the time zone difference though… She's going to be sleeping all day every day and up all night and I can't talk to her! Ha ha ✈️ She will be studying here through January. 🏤📚
