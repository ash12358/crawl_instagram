Made myself a little healing space between the bed and closet. Just a little place where I can turn on the TENS unit and heating pad for sweet relief. Returning to PT tomorrow!

5 years sober, today. A no makeup selfie wouldn’t have ever happened then, I had such low self-esteem, lacked confidence, needed my mask. But here I am now. I’m sick 🤕 I am awaiting the next specialist appt. but I am free. #soberaf #refugerecovery #recovery #wedorecover #soberlife #soberissexy 💜Well I never! Never thought I could stop drinking! Here I am 5 years sober today! And nearly 17 years off drugs. But it was the booze that was so hard to quit! So many layers of dirt I had to sift through to find the prize... I used to look at 5-year sober people like they were The Illuminati or something... I was like this Cling-on barnacle whining, “Teach meeeeeee....” 🤣 Best thing about long-term sobriety is all the meditation. 😉 I have met the coolest hero survivors and I call them friends now. I GET to go to jail and help others, I GET to go to meetings (if I do choose), I GET to work in a recovery center and a detox and other treatment facilities around town where I continue to impact others so there are less of US suffering. I GET to take my knowledge and experience back to journalism and help my community because I’m not some shielded and sheltered book-learned journalist who doesn’t “get it” and asks dumb effing questions. I am extremely privileged to have all these blessings! I GET to wake up sober. And all those Rock stars I used to party with...are sober now too 🤣 or dead 💀 that’s just how it works. I’m sure it’s no secret that my beliefs have changed in 5 years, that I go to less AA meetings. I’m more in the habit of online meetings now, probably from not having a car for 10 months. I’ve really grown to love and enjoy Refuge Recovery and NA a lot more. I would LOVE ❤️ for there to be an RR meeting in Wichita! While the weather is good and once my health is improved, I’d love to check out some RR meetings in Tulsa & OKC & KC. It’s been an EXHAUSTING couple weeks with whatever is going on with my health. Sometimes I have to crap out and take a nap, leave early or take a day off. Thanks for your support. Every manager I have has been supportive and understanding as well as coworkers and friends. I can’t believe I have the community I do, the jobs

If I’m not up all night finishing reading “The President Is Missing” by James Patterson and Bill Clinton. My senses slaughtered on Juneteenth, of all days, logging onto fb and seeing pure drivel, hatred, hate speech, all caps curse words, insults, ignorance, racism et al regarding the happenings of the world today. Grateful for a good book and some escapism, and this paragraph reminiscent of times that made sense. The words of Clinton? Patterson? Both? But great words nonetheless.

Not every #broadcast journalist is a social worker, but some of us are! When not on air at KFDI News, I am at Crossover Recovery Center, sometimes the Community Crisis Center, WRC, and often Sedgwick County Detention Facility! My social work helps me make inroads into community issues. Coming soon on our At Issue program, I talk to Bailey Blair of @StopSuicideICT. #StopSuicideICT #BroadcastGood

Add to his list of nicknames, “Waterboy.” Just chillin in the shower rinsing off with my eyes closed, listening to Mazzy Star and Beachhouse, when I open my eyes to see the face of this mime in the shower! 1/3 of his fat little body trying to look in on me!

Here’s the work I’ll be doing, a$$holes n elbows for a bit. Nearly 5 years sober and needing, feeling, craving my way towards something deeper. Thinking 🤔 how I need to grow now, where is the journey leading now? I was raised Athiest, chose Christianity a few years into #recovery from #addiction. But. I. Just. Need. Something. Else. I need and crave something that causes no harm and stresses causing no harm. Also, this book from Diane Stein jumped off my shelf and yelled DO THE WORK at me and i opened up to the right page and right message. My work is icky and ugly right now. No wonder I crave the compassion and kindness of #RefugeRecovery

I feel moved to say something, just to be transparent about myself and my life. This car took a LONG time to obtain. I SUFFERED for ten months, which is NOT ok. So I chose to put a stop to this two weeks ago. Some of you may know a “friend” told me they were going to “give” me a FREE car as a gift. That individual GHOSTED me over 5 weeks ago. The notion of a “gift” car was raised in FEBRUARY. I felt patronized, hurt 😔 and ANGRY so I had to move FORWARD and out of that space in every way. No one can live in the energy of being patronized! Ever! I’ve spent the day cleaning and clearing and seeking out objects in my home that hold that energy. Tore up photos and “gifts” given to me in such a similar and PATRONIZING manner have been thrown away. Building BIG ass fences now, bigger than before. I thought I learned boundaries in nearly 5 years of recovery but I have been HUMBLED. Not everyone who calls them self a friend with good intentions deserves to be let inside my fence. #selfcare #fierceselfcare #bigfuckingfence #boundaries #bordersandamoatwithgators #reclaimingmytime #notfuckwithable #soberaf #humility #Wichita #downtownWichita #ict #WichitaTransitSucks #onwardandupward

I have been trying to feel through this tragedy, process, pray and process. RIP WPD Officer Stacy Woodson and his son, Braeden. If I can spend $300/month on Uber for a car-less 10 months, anyone can spend #whateverittakes to NOT drive UI. There are cabs. There is Lyft. There is parking and passing out with the keys to your car placed outside the vehicle on top of a tire. But there’s never a good reason to drive UI. People in meetings say, “you could have killed someone,” well what about TWO PEOPLE? What about a child? Please get help. Help is everywhere. #noexcuses🚫 #soberaf

Lunch hour spent outside the office in quiet solitude means so much to me! All made possible by my new car! Yesterday, I visited Aunt Helen and Zandra at White Dove. I’ve gotten to visit Geno in the hospital. I put gas ⛽️ in my car first FREE lunch break this week! Omg I am loving the car life after 10 months without a car!!!!!! #freedom #newcar #manifestation #manifesting #visionboard #lovinglife

Back here again. Oh the irony! I was so prepared — over prepared — for my hematology appt last week and I don’t need any blood thinners. My friend got sick out of the blue Saturday night no warning! So here we are again. And he’s gonna be ok y’all. Keep the prayers coming for our guy. You know I had to make sure the nurses were super cute for him 😉 and they are! Two nurses working on setting him straight right now! Imma walk back to the #recovery center listening to some @eminem and saying the #serenity prayer a few times!

I know that the energetic suck and emotional labor are on the line, but I can’t let it slide. I am a #Christian but #notallchristians are homophobes. The man who spoke for EXNM Friday night in #Wichita at #intrustbankarena was doing ok until he mentioned how they “saved” a woman from a few things: 1) a Satanic Church 2) porn and 3) “the homosexual lifestyle.” Not cool. The anti-gay (tired/old) rhetoric went over like a lead balloon with my friend’s teen daughter and I. (Our group of 8 bought 8 tickets = 4 kids, 4 adults, $10 in parking, unknown $$ in food and drinks, including my pre-show espresso at Meads). My teen buddy wrinkled up her face at the notion of homosexual hatred. I was angry. I am an LGBTQ ally 🏳️‍🌈 and, as such, I acknowledge I don’t spend enough time #callingout IGNORANCE. As the aunt of a #trans nephew, friend of gays and trans folx — and a Christian — I must speak up. @exnmmissions do not come to my town with your bigotry and assumptions. You want to plant churches? I recommend you don’t plant the hate along with. Your speaker’s comment was overly presumptive. He incorrectly assumed gay Christians don’t exist. He incorrectly assumed Wichitans are like this because of our geographic location in the #BibleBelt. In Kansas, I have known more LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 people than I did in San Francisco. I have known more #transgender people here than I did growing up in the #SFBayArea! And let me point out I have many LGBTQ friends who attend Christian Church here in Wichita. My late friend Dan was gay and raised an evangelical Christian. Another thing, no one needs to be “saved from a homosexual lifestyle.” People do need to be saved from poverty and violence. The Bible talks about caring for the poor, the sick, the orphans — things we do in Kansas whether Christian or not. We do not “save” people from their sexuality. #rude In my church, what we DO save people from is addiction, poverty, trafficking, violence, homelessness, etc. this is what good Christians do. This is what good people do. We feed and clothe the poor. We get people medical care. We get them to know Jesus. Save people from Satan and porn all you want, but you have some learning to do.

This is a good story. I found out I carry the genetic mutation my dad does, so this means I have the potential to have blood clots. I’m sure I will learn more, but what I know right now is: 1. I’m positive for the genetic mutation 2. I get a fancy, new, bright and shiny hematologist now. What I don’t know is if I will be on blood thinners sooner or later. Someday I’m sure I will be. I see my fancy new doctor on the 9th. How do I know this? My doctor’s office made me this appointment. I updated my emergency contact info at work. I am wearing this bracelet now. My medical ID is on my iPhone. After I start working with the hematologist, I will get one of those fancy, metal engraved bracelets as my EMT friend told me to go old school like that. Thanks to my dad for getting me the info I needed to take care of myself! You are a good dad! ❤️ March is blood clot awareness month! If you have a family history of blood clots like I do, don’t ignore the signs and get checked. More at StopTheClot.org. I am still free of nicotine since 2-13-18. Annnd the only reason I got checked at this time is I got strep and spent $10 on Uber to get to the doctor and I will be damned if I had to pay that on a different day to get a blood test done, so with my fever of 101 and a swollen throat I got my blood drawn for the test — no excuses! 🤣#stoptheclot

Photo of the #missingchild we’ve been covering all evening. (More at KFDI.com). If you have any info, call 911.  Lucas Hernandez, 5, was last seen in his bedroom around 3pm. Last seen in black sweatpants and a grey shirt with a bear on it + wearing white socks. Come on, internet. Let’s find this kid. #Wichita #missing #missingkid #missingboy #ICT #REPOST #Kansas #missingchildren

My non-smoking #Lent begins...#novaping #nonicotine but plenty of #ACIM and the #Bible. More time with G-o-d and less time/space/energy wasted on vaping. I have struggled with quitting nicotine for the past year! This time, it must stick. What better day to begin than Lent/Valentine’s Day? Enjoy the #LOVE today! ❤️❤️❤️

Every great teacher on #abundance and #moneymanifestation tells you to keep a $100 bill on you so you can always see it and feel #prosperous. My life is mostly cash-less.

Flashback to some of the animals I’ve loved before! My black cat Alcatraz who passed last year, and the other two, in retrospect, I probably should have stolen from bad humans but it wasn’t meant to be. (The black cat was top priority and wouldn’t have been ok with those other two males).

Last chance to order Perfectly Posh from me today and tomorrow! I am shutting down my Posh business as 2017 draws to a close. It's been fun, but it's not for me long-term. I must free up my schedule as I am returning to school in 2018 and am more committed than ever to my life coaching business, Destiny Architecture. Also, since I went back on the air doing part-time radio news for KFDI, my ability to keep up with Posh's rapidly-changing business model declined. There have been and will continue to be many changes with the Posh brand and products. I grew frustrated that every time I fell in love with a product, it would "retire." Some products "retire" to later re-emerge, or re-emerge with another name, which isn't fair to consumers. Orders consistently took too long to process/ship and the $5.99 shipping fee makes it hard to compete with other brands -- especially when Amazon pretty much trained the world on both fast and cheap. To be brutally honest, I failed at this. I failed at direct sales. This is OK, I believe in failing forward quickly and using my failures to learn. What I learned is I am not great at sales and marketing. What I am great at is evangelizing a product/brand I believe in and I am great at endorsing it -- likely from my 20 years in broadcasting and endorsing everything from Max Factor lipsticks to night clubs. I am also great at content creation. Duh. Moving forward, I will keep trying new things. I will play to my strengths instead of trying to better a weakness I don't passionately want to change as much as I want other things in life. I am thankful for your business and the connections I made selling Posh! I wanted to learn more about direct sales and selling in general and I did. I wanted to make extra money and I did -- I just didn't make the amount I wanted to generate on a monthly basis. I learned the market is saturated with women directly selling to family and friends who are constantly being hit up not just by direct sellers (Posh, 31, Younique, Rodan & Fields, LulaRoe etc) but people are also constantly being hit up for fundraisers -- everything from greeting cards to Girl Scout cookies and nuts. (I always buy from the

Good morning! The view from here... make it a great short week. So much to be grateful for! People ask me a lot about riding the bus. Since I’m in the recovery community, I get a lot of questions like, “so you don’t have a driver’s license?” Actually, I do. Or people ask, “WHY are you waiting for the bus at Broadway and Murdock?” Because that’s where the bus stop is. Duh. Plus, some of my #recovery clients ONLY will speak to me on that street. Peer mentor in the streets, not in the seats — as Big Jeff says! Ha! I love it when people ask, “you want a ride?” And I say yes of course. It’s good to receive! But there’s no shame in riding @Wichitatransit. Sure, it’s not easy. It’s time consuming. It’s three hours of my day commuting — which I promised never to again when I left Phoenix and San Francisco... but at least I’m not driving in traffic. I’m thankful for that. I’m thankful that when my truck hit 279,000 Miles and died in the middle of the road that I didn’t get hurt. I’m thankful that when I wrecked on my Tao tao scooter, I didn’t break any bones. I’m just thankful. When I get a car again soon, I’ll be more thankful than ever to have 4 wheels, not two! 😆
