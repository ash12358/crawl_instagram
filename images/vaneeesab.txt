#Koninklijk #Conservatorium, #TheHague, #1996, Vanessa Blaylock #dancing with Stephen Carpenter. I was #26 and in #gradSchool. Steven was a #beautiful #dancer and, damn, a beautiful man. I was #dating someone else at the time, a guy named Mark (different Mark from the Mark Zackerly I later married) but somehow I always sort of imagined that Stephen and I would #date one day. We never did. When I #married Mark years later, I remember #wondering why Stephen and I had never dated. Oh well. Dancing with him was a really #powerful and #rich #experience.  #xx

Culture is virtual! It's true. Think about it. The way we craft our individual #identity, our #group #community, it's all thru #mediated tools. #Culture is #virtual. It's not #real vs #fake. It's different #shades of "real" as we choose to invest in them. If #virtualReality is "real" then what is "normal" reality? Do we #backronym it "physical reality"? The truth is there's a lot more "virtual" in physical #reality then we like to admit. How much stuff have you done that was never really real? #Jobs that meant nothing? #Dates that were #boring? What was so real about any of that? When you choose to #invest in a #moment, virtual or physical, you make it real. When a community invests in its own identity, culture is virtual.

Is it about being the #Queen, the #king, the #star? Is it about 20th-century one-2-many #media? #Record companies and #book #publishers and #movie #studios #anointing a few to #communicate with the many? Is it about #protecting #copyright? Is it about protecting revenue stream? Where does this 21st-century many-2-many #moment leave us? Can you still make #money from your #song? With everybody making #music, making #blogs, #uploading #videos? Or is making money a conceit? Music was once #sacred. If we drive the moneychangers from the #temple, if we share our "amateur" work freely, can we #reclaim the sacred #value? #xx

Sometimes I feel like 2013 is such a shitty year for freedom. #AaronSwartz dead. #BradleyManning guilty. #EdwardSnowden stranded. But look at 1968: #MartinLutherKing Jr. assassinated. #AndyWarhol shot, two days later #BobbyKennedy assassinated. #NelsonMandela spent that whole year in prison. Maybe Every year sucks if you care about #freedom. The women of #PussyRiot are spending 2013 in prison. Agnes and Moni and I have decided to organize a Pussy Riot #Solidarity #Parade as our small gesture of support and admiration for their vision and their courage. It's going to be in virtual #Moscow on Saturday the 17th. Agnes has been making all kinds of #cute #T-shirts and #Balaklava's for everyone to wear. We're going to have a photo shoot this Sunday at 10 AM PST with all her new fashions. And then Monday we're opening a shop to distribute them. I hope you'll join us Sunday or Monday or next Saturday. We'll never have even a tiny fraction of the impact that these amazing women are having, but anything is better than sitting by silently. #xx

#Career #Change. #Virtual #PerformanceArtist: #2009 - #2013. New mission: Virtual #PublicArt ist. It isn't so much a new direction for the work, as it is the "title" catching up with where the work has already gone. I don't mean to be silly about titles, an artist does whatever work it is that she does. But with the title I mean to suggest what the focus of the work has already become, which is less about #formal #design from me, and more about #empowering #avatar #communities to #explore their own #identity, #culture, and #civilRights in #cyberspace. #xx

#HALLIBURTON, #THEHAGUE, #2001, â€“ From 2001 to 2008 I was a #choreographer at The Hague office of Halliburton. I'm so #proud of the #synchronized #skydiving #choreography I created. It makes me cry that it's all secret and you can never see it. The #Dance of #Destruction was the largest #project I've ever worked on in my life. I made so much money it was crazy! I'm wearing a #Versace blouse in this photo. Wow. I actually used to be able to afford that stuff! The work I do today is so much smaller in scope. It doesn't function on the same global scale. But it's far more me. It's far more deeply #personal. Far more satisfying. Those old times were crazy and amazing. But I wouldn't go back. I'm happy with who and where I am today. I'll probably never buy Versace again. But I did once! Crazy. #xx

Tuesday, 30 June #2009. #Drottingholm. This is the first time I met #Pennyroyal! She and I were both on the list from some #jerk #museum #curator, and he sent out a notice about an #event at Drottingholm. We both showed up there at the same time, ran into each other, and have been good #friends ever since. The #obnoxious curator, his museum, and even Drottingholm itself, are all gone now, but Penny and I are still #longtime friends. I even forgave her the whole #fuss about the #Hibernia #Bank thing. We were #young and #stupid, what did we know? @monerda @pennyroyal #xx

Don't #play with me, 'cause you're #playing with #fire. Some people command such #respect. Have so much #power. That's never been me. I've always felt somehow #inconsequential. A trifle. Am I #weak? Or just searching for some other way of being in this world, besides our #testosterone laden #tropes.

Feeling Blue. It's funny, I'm totally #feelingBlue. But I'm not depressed or sad, I'm #happy & #inspired. Why does "blue" mean sad? Because It's not #rosy? So who's wrong the typical phrase? Or me? Or am I #HumptyDumpty now? When I use a word it means exactly what I mean it to mean nothing less and nothing more? I think the cultural phrase "feeling blue" is right. But I think in this case I'm not wrong. I'm just feeling a #different kind of blue. Ha ha a different #shade of blue perhaps. Anyway I'm totally feeling blue today, and it feels so great. #xx

#VB50 will be our last #performance. But it's not the end! Just the last "performance." In August we'll start a new series of #activities. Less #structure from me, more individual creativity from the #participants. More opportunity to #express and #explore. #Welcome to #2013. It's all about #individuality. It's all about you. Again.

OMG here's an #analogy for you! If you've ever been #seasick on a #boat, the more you try not to throw up, the worse you feel. If you just lean over the side and let it go, you quickly feel so much #better. Ha ha! I #guess #decisions are kind of like that for me. The idea that something you worked so hard on for the past four years is #finished is a little bit #crazy. Really? But I do think it's the right #idea, and once you've made the #decision it's just like #clear #sailing for a little while. It's just nice to have found your heading, to be #moving #forward, and to feel a #crisp new #breeze across your #face. Oh and yes, in case you're #wondering, I am sort of sticking my #tongue out and biting it in this photo. I used to do that all the time in #ballet. I got #yelled at so many times for that. It's #funny, if you do that in #sports they think it means you're really trying hard and you're really #focused. But in ballet, oh it just looks terrible! Stop it #Vanessa!

You make a #choice because it #feels right. And then everything #flows forward from there. A #fork. An #explosion. A #creation event. Four years and four months ago I created my first #Virtual #Performance #Artwork. Now 52 months later I'm about to perform my 50th and final piece. It's not the end of a #career, but it is a new fork in the road. I'm proud of these performance works that we have created, but it's time to do something more, and something less. Our next piece #VB50: #FarewellLEA11 will complete the "Performance" series. For the next 18 months I'd like to focus on creating "Activities." The #Activities will have some kinship with the Performances. But they will be less about formal #design by me, and more about simple #invitations for people to come together to #explore and #experience. Less "create," more "#inspire". Less "auteur," more "facilitator." A new choice is made, a new #journey beginsâ€¦ #xx

Lyssa Varun. Lyssa the mermaid! That's right Pay, Lyssa was, an obviously still is, into the mermaid thing! I guess you must've met me, huh, I think I only looked around like once. I probably was thinking about a performance of some sort, but never got around to it.

Lyssa Varun. Long time #VBCO #scriptGirl and also long time missing, Lyssa Varun stopped by #LEA11 the other day. It was great to see her. She's been mostly out in other #MMO's and apparently earning a living, and only visiting these parts to check a few messages and update viewers. We haven't worked together on a project for some time, but it was just really nice to spend a few minutes with her once more.

#Sleep. It's not that I dislike it. In theory, I like it plenty. I just don't seem to do much of it. The #projects I work on always #occupy my mind, and the moment I wake up instead of going back to sleep it's "let's get to work!" I've been #married twice. I think, as best as I can know, or as #honest as I can be, our sex lives were pretty good. But both times we often lived in different cities, and didn't actually sleep together as often as #couples might. I wonder if that made a difference. I wonder if I was a #badWife. I wonder if there's some #genderRole that makes that my #responsibility more than Mark's or more than Ze's. Can #couples with both partners being really driven, really work? How do the Brad and Angelina's, or Ashton and Demi's, make it work? It just seems like there's so many things to #obsess over. Could it be that a simpler life, simpler goals, #simpler expectations, maybe less "self actualization" on the parts of the partners, actually makes for a better, deeper, stronger #relationship? Or is that just mutual #dependence? I don't know. I'm #sleepy.

Yes I wore #Jade #eyeshadow! Don't beat me up about it. I really love #Amber, the #color, the #mineral, it's #radiant #glorious, but it's also the color of life. Of #human life. The thing that I find so intriguing about Jade is that it's the #opposite color of human life. Of fleshy pink skin. Of the rosy #complexion. Jade is different. Jade is #contrast. I've been thinking about #homophily and how our gigantic #Internet ear is so often tuned to such a tiny range of #voices. Like television, radio and so many #media before, the Internet has the promise of #sharing and growing and #teaching so much, but it's already been so heavily co-opted by traditional commercial interests and their traditional models for the way everything functions. So instead of the net expanding our ears wider, #Facebook tells us to like what our friends like, #Google shows us what's near where we already live. Silly as it seems I put Jade eyeshadow on today, at least a little bit as a plea for #diversity, for contrast, for thinking a little bit wider than the obvious. Not that jade eyeshadow is that radical, but at least it wasn't The most obvious choice. I'm happy with my green eyeshadow. Even though I'm not "Irish." Or I guess specifically because I'm not.

#Agnes, yes that's right, Agnes-I'm-too-fucking-lazy-to-get-my-own-Instagram-so-my-BFF-Vanessa-can-have-fun-tagging-me-in-her-lameo-pix-Sharple, that Agnes, and I were talking about the #AltBall coming up on Saturday at #ClubMorpheus. Of course we hope a bunch of #Alts will show up!

Today was a #good day. It's #funny, I don't think of myself as, or I don't try to be, #highStrung. But I do, I think, work hard on #projects, and that #creates a certain #focus and #intensity. That's great in many ways. But in a way maybe it's too #determinist. I think there's a real #power to #indeterminacy. One that I confess I don't fully understand. What I do know is that I had a great day today in part because it was "easy". Because I let go and wasn't trying to be too deterministic. Perhaps my #frustrating days are days when I'm so focused on a specific #result that I have to get there and either don't, or maybe I do but it's just so much work. So this little #smile you see #curling the corners of my #lips, it's not for anything grand or grandiose, it's just because I let go a little bit and today felt good. I did nice work with people I love and we had a great #experience.

You'd think I would have learned last year. How #stupid can I be? Another #summer, another #sunburn. Maybe it's not me, exactly. Maybe there's something about the #intoxicating #hug of the summer #sun that our bodies just can't resist. In America it's the #4thOfJuly this week! A day of #celebration! A day of #BBQ burnt #meatFood; a day of sun #burnt skin. Join us on Saturday the 6th of July, 10 AM Pacific time, for #VB49: #SPF50 @ #LEA 11 in #SecondLife. We'll #celebrate the glory of pink skin and #ouchy sunburns! :)

Went to the #beach yesterday. Not really warm enough for beach #weather yet. Not really warm enough to get a #sunburn. But now I'm up at four in the morning just #feelingGreat. Not really burnt, but maybe sort of #sautÃ©ed. #Summer's not just about the #temperature, it's also a state of mind. Things' been going pretty well, but there's always #stress, and a #holiday is a great day. So we went and we #played. We #ate too much. We were in the sun too much. We #flirted and #laughed. Ahh, summer.

What a crazy fact of life in this world that I can no longer spell my name #Vaneeesa with three E's, but my cat #Despicable Meee can still spell his name with 3 E's. That's #cats and #dogs for you! He lives by his own rules, but as a loyal #dog needing the #approval of my #master, I have to follow rules as given. Then again, Despicable Meee doesn't want a #GooglePlus account! If he did, that might be another #story! :P

I needed a photo for today's #AskFM #question, and this one seems fitting, or #amusing. The question is: "do you remember your #firstkiss?"My actual first #kiss was my sister Fiona (ewww) but I assume the question means your first, you know, #butterflies in your stomach, kind of kiss. That was a guy named #Brian. He was so #beautiful! I always thought he was so much older, but we were actually the same age. He just seemed to know things or have #experience or something. I really liked him, but I was also afraid, and I didn't feel like I was on his level. So the eventual first kiss, was actually a sort of #goodbyeKiss. I think he liked me, but I think he wanted to move on to more, IDK, available girls. He actually looked me up years later, and it seems like his life had turned out pretty well. By most measures I think he's more successful than me. But I had a sense, and I hope I'm not projecting anything, but I had a sense that there was this hole in his life, and that was sort of why he was looking me up. He was married with kids I don't think he wanted anything from me. But I think he thought I possessed this "art" thing that he found interesting. Or that maybe that was what in a way was missing from his theoretically complete life. Anyway it was just really nice to see him again.

So often my life feels like a #mirage the #desert. My life has always been ruled by #doubt. I know so many #artists, and others, whose lives seem to be ruled by total #confidence and #vision. I don't know if I have ever been them. #Faith and doubt have a funny #relationship. It seems that the deepest faith requires doubt. Yet for a person of faith the end of the #journey of doubt is a predefined #conclusion. Shouldn't a real #investigation, and real doubt, lead to a truly #unknown, all bets are off, #river #delta #somewhere in the #distance?

I guess it's #utilitarian #photo day today! I'm just posting this pic because I need a new photo for #Google+. Turns out they really care about how you spell your name and stuff, so I'm making some adjustments! You can read the whole crazy story here: http://irez.me/category/wonder/biography

I've been following this amazing 15-year-old #ballerina here on Instagram: @brynballet. She's talented, hard-working, generous, and beautiful. It's funny how we manufacture #identity. And how we make all these assumptions about the aspects of our life that we think define who we are. Even though I don't really do ballet now, and maybe don't even believe in it anymore, still, @fionablah and I took class for so many years! And I've always thought it was a substantive part of who I was, of who I am. But when I see how hard Bryn works, and how #beautiful her work is, I suddenly realize that Fiona and I were never all that serious about #ballet. It's not exactly sad, my work is somewhere else today, it's just a surprise to figure out I wasn't who I thought I was, or that I was heading where I have finally arrived, for so much longer than I realized. #Life! #Crazy!

#Milan #2011. My endlessly connected mother got me the chance to attend a couple events at #fashionWeek. This is a funny picture, there's all the #paparazzi, and there's you, and you're perfectly aware that their being there has nothing to do with you, but sometimes, maybe just for a moment, you imagine what if it did? We know what #celebrity is, and most of us aren't it. By definition of the #economy, you can only have a few #millionaires, it requires the rest of us to not be millionaires to make them possible. Same with celebrity, most of us can't be celebrities if we're going to focus that much #media #attention on a few. In this #newMedia #moment we have the possibility of #many2many instead of the old #20thCentury #one2many mode. How do we define #success today? By #money? By celebrity? By number of #likes or #follows on Instagram or Facebook or any other platform? I don't #believe that any of these #measures will bring us true #satisfaction in the long run. Today, maybe more than any earlier time, we have to define our own success in our own way. If we let the media defines success for us, we might find ourselves with "success" but not very much #satisfaction.

#NYC #2010. After my #marriage to Mark had ended my mother was excited to have me date this #business #tycoon #CharlesRosenthal. Our #values were pretty different, sometimes I found him #embarrassing in social situations, and in the end I think my mother liked him a lot more than I did. I have to say he was amazing in the bedroom. What is it with #Republicans and sex? We only #dated a short while and the last time I saw Charles was in 2010 September. He #died seven months later in 2011 April in an #autoAccident in #Montemartre. I was #surprised at how #distraught I was. At his funeral I #cried buckets for a man I hadn't really care that much for. When Charles was #alive I was so critical of him. Once he was gone all I could think of was how #kind and #thoughtful he was. How #funny he was. In life I had been over #critical and not seeing how good he was. In #death I was over #complementary and build something of him that maybe he wasn't. The #real #man was neither of those men, but someone less #simple, more #complex, and more #nuanced.

#WilkinsonEyre #Architects #London #2003. #BridgeOfAspiration #FloralStreetBridge Hey @elisalarrea my mom @maggiebla sent my sister @fionablah & I to #ballet since forever! In college I studied #modernDance and #contemporaryDance, and then in grad school #performanceArt. So over the years I've moved away from ballet. And then just recently I've been reading #LisaSee novels, like #SnowflowerAndTheSecretFan or #PeonyInLove, with all these horrific #footBinding scenes. Not saying dancing on #pointe is exactly foot binding, but it's hard not to think of it in terms of a sort of #oppression and #objectification these days. I still have a certain love of that #balletLine, but it's very mediated and tempered for me now. I think I prefer more humble considerations of the body now. I suppose it's that #romanticized #modernism versus the #messy #complexity of more #postmodern perspectives. Anyway it's a beautiful #bridge and yes she is a #beautiful #ballerina.

#AixEnProvence #France #2011. #Honeymoon! Ze and I got #married at #CoventGarden in London, and he said why don't we honeymoon in #Paris! Which was an awfully sweet idea! But I had always wanted to go to Victor #Vasarely's #Architectonic Center in #Aix, So we agreed to honeymoon there. #Geometric #Abstraction by #day, make out by #night! :-)

#Williamsburg #Brooklyn #2013. Fiona and I shared a top floor #NYC #apartment for a little while at the beginning of this year. Sometimes we see each other quite a bit, sometimes we don't see each other for a long time, and ha ha sometimes I think she's dead! :P But we haven't lived together for a long time. We only had the Williamsburg place for a little while but it was really sweet. Fiona is an #amazing person. We're both pretty #sarcastic and so we're always insulting each other, but I think I forgot how #funny she is, how much fun it is to hang out with her, and how much I #love her. Aww, #sisters! Yay!

In case you missed the memo, it's World #GothFair! May 15 â€“ 31. The proceeds go to the #SophieLancaster #Foundation, which is pretty awesome! So I caked on as much #white #facePaint as I possibly could, put about 50 kg of #gel in my #hair, and went #dancing! The #ClubGothica #MobileUnit is doing 14 straight hours of DJ sets! Here I am with #Azzie (#Azurella) who as you can see is monumentally workin the #redRidingHood thing! Azzie's so hot, but OUCH just looking at her #corset makes my ribs hurt!

#The Hague #2013. I look over my #shoulder. To see who's #following me. To see where I've come from. To see if the #road ahead is any different from the road behind. To try to understand what I'm really doing, where I'm really headed. My #life and my #work are #defined by #doubt. I have known #artists, I have known human beings, with unrelenting #confidence. They move with certainty. With conviction. Are they #gifted? Are they self #obsessed? Who's to say? The one thing I know for sure is that my life and my work are defined by doubt. Doubt is my greatest #weakness. Doubt is my greatest #strength. I am doubt.

#Lamar #Colorado #2005. Fiona and I being silly at one of Jeff's #family #reunions. This was one of the last times we all still got along. My #dad's #parents had hated that their parents in #poverty back in #Russia, still gave what little money they had to temple. They turned away from religion. No one has ever told me if they were exactly "atheists" or not, but I guess neither they, and certainly not my dad, practiced anything anyway. My dad's #Blaylock side of the family is small. My mom's #Guerrero side of the family is huge, and all Catholic. A few years after this picture Jeff and Yvonne and the boys all converted to born-again Christianity. They've been proselytizing, and driving everyone else crazy, ever since. As far as I know, I'm the only actual atheist in the family. What few family events I've been to since these changes, have become just unbearable. It's hard to believe, or hard to remember, how close Jeff and I were for most of our lives. On those rare occasions when I do see him now, we work so hard to keep the conversation as superficial as possible, because we know if we talk about anything that really matters, it's just going to get combative and ugly. Funny thing is, right about the same time he had his conversion event, I "converted" to the "Church of #FreeCulture."It might seem silly, but I've realized that I have become just as dogmatic, just as proselytizing, and just as unsufferable, as he has. We're totally different now, and yet ironically, we're still totally the same.

Ha ha, the genius of #bluemars #mobile! I haven't seen @tizzers In quite a while, but they've still got her #avatar and you can call her up! You can't do much except stand around or #dance. But I suppose it's amusing.

Hi guys! #AgentCyan here. It's #LEA #artistInResidence #day2/20 today! Today I'm jumping off the #LEA11 #Lighthouse and walking into the western #mountains, #crossing the #border, and heading into LEA13 "#Rust" I'll be making some #cyanotype Instagram's (which you're looking at) and also some #Keek videos. Here on Instagram I'm Vaneeesab but on Keek like most other places you'll find me as just Vaneeesa. Yes, that's an "M" tat on my hand, as in Ze Moo. You saw the size of the rock the guy bought me, I DK, I guess I got carried away or something! :-)

Whatever you do don't be so #obsessed by snapping your next #masterpiece for Instagram that you don't even see the #giant #cactus you're about to walk into, get a bunch of #stickers in your leg, be lazy about getting over to the ER, and wind up with #necrotizing leg flesh! Go ahead, #laugh now, but it could happen to you! That's all I'm saying.

San Francisco 2001. Field Marshal Pennyroyal made us participate in #reprogramming #activities. We had to make #videos for the #media renouncing our #bourgeois ways, and this was a #collage I was forced to create to show how our destructive ways just hurt ourselves and all the people. It was really, really stupid. But after all the torture and abuse you started to believe it yourself. I was broken down to nothing, then rebuilt in Pennyroyal's likeness. I hated my captor. I hated myself. And no, she never did buy me the #shoes she promised.

#Havana #2008. And then there was the time that my #stupid #sister Fiona had the #brilliant #idea to use beach sand to make a full body cast of my torso to make #mannequins for her new brilliant #dance project! Do I even have to tell you how that turned out!? Fiona: always big on #creativity, sometimes a little short on the details. #WhatWasSheThinking

I WANT YOU! To explain this Instagram thingy to me! Over half the people who follow me are, no offense, but as far as I can see, Insta #spammers! I know everybody likes to have lots of followers, but what's the point of having #fake #followers? I don't get it? Anyway, I suppose it doesn't do any harm but it's just kind of weird. Can anybody explain? Thank you! #like4like #lol #instalike etcetera! :)

OMG I'm just so full of myself since Mr. Moo bought me that #ring! Look at me now ha ha â€“ it's all about the #bling #baby! I actually got those #heart shaped #sunglasses ages ago, but I never had the nerve to wear them, all of a sudden they feel just right.

#SanFrancisco #2001. Souvenir from Field Marshal Pennyroyal. One photo survived the fire at the safe house. Not happy times. Don't know why I kept it. Might be better off without it. Maybe it's important to remember. Penneyroyal said I was a #cute #girl. She liked my #eyes, she liked my #makeup. She promised me #shoes. So many lies.

#RÃ­o #2003 #portrait of me by my #babySister #Gwen. Fiona is the oldest, Jeff and I are twins, and Gwen's the baby. Fiona and I were sort of always rivals, I guess cause she's the oldest, and also totally snotty, of course! Jeff and I were so close for most of our lives, but now with "recent events" we really just don't even speak to each other at all anymore. When I see my mom you can see how depressed she is because Jeff and I aren't speaking. I don't know what to do. It's just so hard to talk to him anymore. And with Gwen, IDK, it's just always been so easy and nice. Maybe because Fiona and I were kind of rivals and Gwen was younger and I don't know but I don't think we've ever even had a coarse word really. And then sometimes she does these really pretty portraits of me! :-)

#KeyWest #Florida #2003 Fiona and I were wintering in Florida. We met this guy Fross Maruti. He had this thing "The Free #Portrait #Studio"And he made this #pastel of me. After everything that happened I was sure he was some kind of #scammer. What did he want? A #Date? #Money? #Drugs? It was inconceivable to me that someone could do something nice just to be nice and not for some other #motive. I didn't really get it, but he was probably the most straightforward person I've ever met. I guess he cashed in big on the #dotcoms or something, and he was really just doing what he loved. He had a shop. You came and hung out. Or you didn't. I had been so #burned and so hurt because of my #innocence and #naÃ¯vetÃ©. And I vowed never to be so stupid and so taken advantage of again. And then I met this simple, honest, #generous guy. And I wasn't capable of believing him. I wasn't capable of taking things for the simple beauty of what they were.

Whatever you do, #DON'T #FOLLOW #ME! I know it might sound like a clever way of trying to get you to follow me, but it isn't. We're all so #obsessed with "follow me" that #meaningless follows and #goingViral become a #substitute for #real #substance, a substitute for actually being alive. I could care less who or what you follow, but follow something #real, and follow it for real.

#TheHague #2005. The whole Field Marshal Pennyroyal thing left me pretty #scarred for some time. I didn't want to do #karaoke for a while, although I did after a little bit go back to it. I was afraid because my #singing had gotten me in so much #trouble and caused me so much #pain. But what I realized is that your #voice is never your #enemy. Sometimes, if you #sing #loud enough, your voice can be heard by evil ears, but your voice is not your enemy, it's those ears. And maybe in a way my real enemy was my own neediness. I didn't have to be so susceptible to #Pennyroyal, but I think there were just such holes in my life that I craved the attention. If #breathing is #life, then singing is the #artForm that is closest to life itself. I'll never have a #rockstar voice, and I'm fine with that now. I don't care who hears me, or if anyone hears me, because I try as best as I can, to only sing for myself now. I don't want to have a big #heroic voice, I just want to have my own small, #honest voice. I sing because I am alive, nothing more.

And then things started to get really #weird. It all became a big #downward #spiral. @Fionablah came to visit, and we did #karaoke â€“ which was super fun, at least for a while â€“ But then we met this #FieldMarshal @Pennyroyal, who was pretty charismatic, but I think she #drugged us. Pennyroyal kidnapped us and held us captive in a tiny closet. She barely fed us, screamed at us constantly, and made us do things. They changed my name to #Tania, and Fiona's name to #Tonya. I was made to #rob #banks, and Fiona was made to #assault #iceSkaters. God what a #horrible #nadir for such previously privileged #princesses.

#paloalto #2001 oh gawd, I really WAS a #zombie! I look like I'd been #abducted by a #cult! Lucky me though, instead of joining Tom Cruise religion, I became a #performanceArtist! :)

#PaloAlto #2001#California. The Young #housewife. Mark was making so much #money with his #Internet #startUp. And I was so #bored. I started to make up #elaborate #rituals, just to convince myself that I was actually still #alive.

#delft #2005 #vermeer's place #netherlands. Sometimes I just go there and hang out for hours. #Johannes and I have long, rambling, #imaginary #conversations. Yes, of course, sometimes I am "The Girl". Who hasn't had that fantasy? Okay, often.

And then there was the time that Fiona thought it would be funny to #date two guys at the same time. Of course she used me to juggle her #boyfriends (thanks a lot) This is #NYC like #1986 and I accidentally sent them both to the same diner OMG! Fiona beat the crap out of me for that one! Ouchy! Thanks a lot! Like her flippin love life is my fault!? #Sisters! #uggh! Oh well, what do you expect when your sister is Fiona Shoot-the-messenger Blaylock!
