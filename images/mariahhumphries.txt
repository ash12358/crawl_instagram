I read so much about the history and current condition of people of color. It‚Äôs absolutely necessary for this work in racial reconciliation, but I gotta tell ya...I‚Äôm so excited to read a story about Native Americans, that don‚Äôt live on a reservation, that‚Äôs written by a Native American. #bethebridge

May 5 is National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. People, there is an epidemic of Missing or Murdered Native Women. They are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault and rape than any other ethnic group in the United States. 84% have experienced violence. 56% have experienced sexual violence. Over 90% have experienced violence at the hands of a non-tribal member. On some Native land women are murdered at 10 times our nation's average. #NotInvisible

Today I mourn the loss of Martin Luther King, Jr. not only for his perseverance for racial justice for the African American but also for his friendship to Native Americans. It is not well known that Dr. King was a great ally for Native Americans but it means a great deal to me today. Dr. King wrote about the historic injustices inflicted on Native people in his 1963 book "Why We Can't Wait‚Äù: "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles of racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its Indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it." #MLK50

#InternationalWomensDay. I am grateful for the women in my personal life who have not stopped because a door was closed and encourage me to do the same thing--from my mother Phyllis to achieving more in her 42 years of life than I will in my lifetime, to my aunt Barbara who not only was successful in her higher education career but had a mentor heart and left a piece of her with everyone she met, to my grandmother Jean Sinclair who was an incredible social and political power in her state and challenges me to not just see the other point of view but to learn from it, to my mother-in-law Bobbie who didn't let being paralyzed keep her from having an impactful life, to Dr. Ngan at Truett Seminary who is awesomely breaking my thought process down so it can be built back to be even stronger, to Tasha Morrison who is challenging hearts and minds through Be the Bridge and her work toward racial reconciliation--I am grateful she has asked me to come along for the journey. These are just some of the women from my past and present who have shaped me and I am thankful.

Today Amos is in his hometown of Detroit Michigan where he will receive the "Founders Award" and attend the 10th anniversary of Fish and Loaves Community Food Pantry. Fish and Loaves is a client-choice food pantry that gives dignity to the clients who shop for food there. If you have ever had to go to a "church food pantry" for food, you know how they can be -- expired food, unwanted food, "this makes no sense" bags put together and only non-perishable items. Amos, 12+ years ago, realized people in need deserved more than what churches gave them. He crossed over denominations (GASP!) and worked with local churches in Downriver Detroit to battle the ‚Äúfood insecurity‚Äù that hit many in our community. He, along with the excellent group of ministers and community leaders worked and battled to establish this amazing resource. Until his dying day, he will consider "Fish and Loaves one of the best things I have ever been a part of." As the one who witnessed countless hours/days/months of ideas, frustration, tears, laughter, determination, watched their literal blood and sweat go into the construction of this building and doors opening-- I can agree with his statement. This man makes this family proud. #humphriesnation

Presents were wrapped and opened. Food was prepared and eaten. Movies (SO many movies) were watched and enjoyed. Stories were told and laughs were shared. And now I am resting my head on my pillow, next to one I love the most in this world. I hope each of you had a wonderful Christmas, wherever your head rested. Peace be with each of you.

Only Baylor people will understand the meaning of this but when there was discussion about offering the women who were never allowed to run the Baylor Line, to run this year for the game during Inauguration week, I immediately thought of my friend Elizabeth Simmons. Within a month of meeting Elizabeth, she mentioned how she has always wanted to run the Baylor line. Years later, here she is running and hugging our new President:) I actually teared up for her yesterday. Can I mention again how thrilled I am about Linda Livingstone being here at Baylor?!üôåüèº #‚ÄôBoutTime

25 years ago this world lost one of the best. Grief evolves as time goes by and we enter new stages in life. I currently grieve that friend and confidant relationship we never got to have. She was a wise one - and Godly. I'd love to sit down and talk to her about life struggles, discuss current events and hear her perspective on the world in 2017.

Love this woman's heart and hate her thighsüòú She makes yummy food and I'm envious of her ability to grow that food. When you find someone who challenges you in life, cries alongside you and makes your belly hurt from laughing, you keep 'em.

My home away from home this past weekend. There were some loud laughs, flowing tears and deep conversations (ridiculous ones too). When God places friends in your life to walk alongside, it's best to give in to the blessings.

You are 18. How is that possible when I remember seeing your face for the first time like it was yesterday? There have been long days but the last 18 years have truly flown by. Perhaps a little too fast for this mom. It‚Äôs a big day for us and for you, but I can say you make this life better, Jonathan Clay Humphries. So thank you for making me a mom.

22 years being this mans wife. Thank you Amos for being my partner in this life. For taking my side even when you may disagree. For making me laugh until I can't breathe. For loving me when I am unlovable. For taking up a cause because I want to. For knowing what I'm thinking without me saying a word. For loving everyone for who they are and what they are. But mostly for showing the love of Christ to others at the most fundamental level. You believe everyone has a voice and everyone is worthy of grace and love. You are an honorable man.

This little cafe was one of my favorite spots in DC and it was the start of a great night on H Street. The best Earl Grey followed by an Ethiopian dinner at Ethiopic and then gelato at Rita's.

Cynicism can creep in when I think about the state of our country, politically, but there's nothing but awe and a true love for this country when I walk around DC. Especially when the view honors those who have sacrificed their life so I can freely be cynical at times. #wwiimemorial

Walking the streets and halls of DC as the parent is quite different than when I was the child. I don't remember so many naked ladies on the buildings and statues but I sure see them now as I walk with the offspring. üò≥

These ladies. We started off intentional, around a table, eating yummy food and slowly opening up about our life. Now they are dear friends in life.

One of my favorite nights of the year. Amos and I have been doing a "Community Christmas Party" for 17 years now. We take families who are having a difficult time putting gifts under the tree this year and our church "adopts" them. We buy their Christmas wish list, we invite everyone to a party, have pizza, sing silly songs, make crafts, give the parents a break from watching kids, and then we open gifts. It's not charity. It's Christianity at its core. It's showing the love of Christ to our community when the world we live in shows judgement. Some families take gifts home because this is all they're getting this year. Others open them right away and the faces make all the work we did worth it. I'm tired. My feet hurt. And more importantly, my heart is full. #parklakewaco #wacotown

Humphries Nation. My world in one image. -- Proud of this kid in the middle. Football Playoffs are up next but it's the man he's becoming that makes me proud. Proud of the little one on the right. Coming out of her shell and showing there's some mighty strength under that shyness. Proud of the one next to me. Learning who/what true friends are and becoming confident in who she is. The one with the hat makes me proud too. Making a difference in our community and state while showing humility.

Teen years can wreak havoc on a girl so it's great to know there's that friend that stays true through all the unneeded drama.

Hello to another year of life. Reaching 42 is a milestone for me as I've now made it to the birthday my mom never reached. So, 42 and beyond, let's see what you've got.

Visiting the 911 Memorial was the most cherished moment of this NYC visit. It was a heavy time of wordless conversations among strangers. I didn't think about looking up until I overheard a story by a man who worked in the North Tower. He was sharing stories of men and women he had worked with but then he said he never realized the beauty here until he lost so much. He then pointed at the buildings around the complex. He never noticed the time represented in the variety of buildings. He had never noticed the designs in the brickwork etc. So I snapped this picture so I could remember that new beauty he discovered in the wake of heartache. It's my favorite image from that visit.  #911memorial #neverforget

This little man is a friend of mine. He just turned 3 and in a couple hours he is going into surgery for some pretty intense issues with his heart. I can't tell you the impact this little guy has had on our family in such a short amount of time. His face lights up a room and you can't help but smile when he looks at you. For those friends of mine who pray, please take a moment to say one for Ty and his family today around noon Central Time. He needs it, his surgical team needs it, and his family needs it. Complete healing is the goal, but peace, comfort, and strength are specific needs for this family at this time.
