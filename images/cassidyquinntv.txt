I AM NOT WORTHY. Got to have these 2 incredibly talented and accomplished humans in the studio tonight, for the beginning of Joe's farewell week on @kgwnews. Seriously honored just to get to sit next to both of you! Joe, you will be SO missed. It's been a pleasure to watch you, and get to work with you! And Steph, I can't even say thank you enough for how much you've helped and inspired me (especially in umm February...)...

Making sweet potato lattes is SERIOUS business. Just ask resident-expert (and occasional Olympic skier) @jacquelinewiles. Also ask the pros at @lionheartcoffee who figured out how to make this delicious South Korean beverage back at home! Thank you, Ben and Lauren, for teaching us your magical ways! The latte and the cold brew version are on the SECRET MENU right now just for a little bit! Go get it because IT'S DELICIOUS. Link to the segment in my story! #pyeongchang2018 #teamusa #pinkyout

Holy moly this is one talented woman! When I was in high school, I wanted nothing more than to be on Broadway. I saw @wicked_musical starring @shobean and was OBSESSED. I had no idea that somehow I would actually get to talk to her someday and have her sing live on my show! She went to @beavertonhigh and is back in town to do a concert Wednesday night. Thanks Shoshana for being SO wonderful and fun, and just a total rockstar!! PS your song is now officially stuck in my head and I am not complaining about that at all!! So. Good.  #TonightWithCassidy Link to the interview in my story!

On the final night of the first week of #TonightWithCassidy, I fell in love... With baby Scarlett, aka Unipipette. She sat peacefully in @theunipiper's arms during her inaugural TV appearance, and just was a perfect little angel while we chatted about her future as a professional unicyclist. And then we presented her with our first ever piece of TWC merch! Thanks to @mschristianh for that awesome and adorable idea! And thanks to Brian (aka Unipiper) for being up for anything as usual and letting us put your daughter on TV!

I‚Äôve been in South Korea for 3 weeks, and I FINALLY tooo @jacquelinewiles‚Äô advice and found a sweet potato latte... Yum!! There‚Äôs no coffee in it, so it won‚Äôt help me stay awake... but it‚Äôs definitely delicious!

Well that was INSANE. Just got a tour of the DMZ, with a group of other NBC reporters. My heart is still beating SO fast. In this first picture, I‚Äôm standing IN North Korea. That‚Äôs in the Military Armistice Commission building, where the North and South meet on Conference Row. The Military Demarcatiom Line runs through the middle of the building, so you‚Äôre able to be on both the North and South. The 2nd picture is Check Point 3. From there, we were surrounded by North Korea from 3 sides, and were told there were snipers pointed at us from all angles. But we made it out safe. Now back to the Olympics.

Proof that the Olympics are actually happening in South Korea!! It's funny, we see our workspace, the buses, and some of the venues, but the athletes and spectators aren't here yet, so it doesn't quite feel REAL yet. I think that'll happen once the Olympics actually start in a few days. For now, I'm enjoying being able to walk around and explore a little bit! #pyeongchang2018

2017 was a year of adventures. And according to my #2017bestnine, a year of a lot of running... And some beer too. It really was a great year! I can't wait to see how 2018 shapes up. I used to hate both running AND beer, so who knows what I can expect for this next year...

Christmas definitely did NOT suck, but I definitely sucked at documenting it! I had a wonderful time with lots of loved ones, and I hope you all did too! Merry belated Christmas, and happy early New Year, in case I forget to post about that too...

Let me preface this by saying I really do love my job (duh)... but listen, anyone who says they get EXCITED to come back from vacation is lying. So yeah, I totally hit an extra snooze (or 2) on my alarm this morning. Then when I got to work and realized we don't have a 7pm show today (thanks #thursdaynightfootballüèà), I got a little excited... Anyway, I'll be back on Live at 7 tomorrow night to kick off December!

Someone just came up to me at the fancy Oregon Sports Hall of Fame ceremony, and said, "Ha! Now I know what you're really wearing on TV!" Yep ... Here's a secret.

The sun is hidden, but it still feels like it's a million degrees out in Portland today. Maybe because a crazy chunk of the state is on fire...

I may technically taste things "professionally" (aka at work), but I'm definitely not a professional taste-tester. I have no idea what 6 fruits are in this @lateshake Eclipse Shake... Besides the activated charcoal powder, which just makes me feel fancy.

This looks very mysterious... It's an #OREclipse milkshake! With mystery flavors... The only ingredient @lateshake will tell is the activated charcoal! Hmmm...

Stopping to smell the flowers on this Monday. Ok fine I'm actually just closing my eyes for a short nap but don't tell anyone. Volunteers at @the_bloom_project are working hard today to make beautiful bouquets to deliver to people in hospice care. And they do smell amazing!
