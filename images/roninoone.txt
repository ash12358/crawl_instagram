Inspired by the @playabowls I had on vacation I made my own smoothie bowl this morning. The base: Blackberries, blueberries, cherries, banana and pasteurized egg whites. On top: Granola and coconut This is gonna become a 'thing' for me. I can feel it.

Every year we take a photo booth shot before leaving the beach. This year the booth was broken so we sat in the booth and used my phone.  #catastrophediverted #traditionmaintained

Morning runs at the beach are the best! I'm shooting for a vacation streak. At least a mile a day.

Usually they only fall asleep on the way home from the beach so this quiet car on the way is a treat. Actually, it may end up being the most relaxing part of the trip.

Going to a potluck tomorrow and decided to have a little fun in the vegetable department. Inspired by @eatingbirdfood I whipped up this spiced roasted cauliflower salad. It's flavored with garlic, onion, ginger,  garam masala, curry and pepper.  Peas and cilantro add some pop and freshness.  It's gonna be awesome at room temp! @waseemask I used your spices! :)

This kid has tested my patience at dinner since the moment he was born. He's pickier than his brother ever was. He's never liked fruit, doesn't use condiments and heaven-forbid there's a grill mark on his meat. When we were in Key West I even had to plead with him to try Key Lime Pie. KEY LIME PIE! He didn't like it but at least he took a bite. He's starting to come around a little but we still have a long way to go. I let him pick one meal a week and he chose hot dogs, bun-less and with no mustard or ketchup, of course. üòè

Less than a month until my 42nd birthday and you know what? I feel (and look -- yeah, I said it) fantastic! Take a moment now and then to high-five yourself. Confidence builds with practice just like everything else.

I just made the best shrimp kabobs ever! They were marinated in olive oil, lemon, lime, garlic, maple syrup, salt and pepper. After skewering them I tossed the broccoli in the same marinade and put them in a grill pan to roast. A bag of instant rice on the side and bam! A perfect mid-week meal. I'm all sorts of motivated in the kitchen right now. I'm so ready to bring back @greenlitebites. I need to stop overthinking it and just do it!

Another Mother-Sons trip in the books! I've committed to taking at least a long weekend every year with just the boys and I going somplace we've never been or doing something we've never done. Key West met both those criteria and it was fun but, I must admit, not my favorite destination for us so far. This year I felt more pressed for time as I had to squeeze our trip out of what vacation days I could juggle at work and that added stress which affected me for sure. I can see these trips getting harder and harder if I don't evolve them as the boys get older. We always discuss what we'd like to do for the following year and I think we're settling on the Pacific  Northwest and possibly another @oars_rafting adventure. We've done two so far and they haven't dissapointed us yet. If you've been following along thanks for traveling with us. I enjoy sharing as it helps me keep my sanity while being alone with two growing boys. üòâ

A cubano at a Cuban restaurant, I didn't think there was any other choice. Until the 13-year-old ordered the palomilla steak (in the background with his bowl of black beans) and now I know.  #sofriggingood #tryingnewthings  #ontheroad #floridakeys #travelingwithkids

We made it to a beach! This is the 7th Mother-sons adventure I've taken the boys on and as they get older the trips are NOT getting easier.  I have less patience and they definitely fight more. It's exhausting! But then I sit on a beach and watch them play and experience the world, and it reenergizes me. #travelingwithkids #keywest

Sarcastic, moody, and annoying, I'm sure 13 is going to test my patience more than anything, but 13 is also wicked smart, hilariously funny, and mature in ways I never expected. I know he thinks birthday pancakes are eye-roll inducing but he let me keep the tradition because he knew it would make me happy. I absolutely love watching him grow up and although I'm nervous about the next few years I'm also excited to see what they bring.

Came home from work and cooked up this a simple meal for the kids and I -- salmon, asparagus and ready rice. I've been seriously considering bringing back the @greenlitebites blog. I love sharing my ideas for fast, nutritious meals and I miss having that outlet soooooo much.

I wanted to take the kids for a walk to get frozen yogurt. They were all whiny about the walking part so I finally said, "Ok, compromise, we'll drive but I'm parking in the furthest spot possible." They didn't believe me until I did. *insert evil laugh here*

I haven't shared a smoothie idea in awhile but this one was so good I felt compelled. Tips... The banana is frozen so no need for ice. I only buy unflavored whey so I'm not stuck with chocolate or vanilla. Plus, no crappy sweeteners. Extracts make great cal-free flavor enhancers! Blend until the whey makes it super frothy and thick.

Having a fun with leftovers during food prep today. I didn't hit the grocery story so I'm playing "Chopped" with what I can find in the pantry and the freezer. (This also has some curry, red pepper, cardamon, and tumeric in it. I'm just too lazy to add all the spices to MFP sometimes.)

The scale's been fairly stagnant but my body composition is still changing. I have never felt this good, even at my lowest WW weight which was 15 pounds lighter than I am right now. It's been 15 weeks of counting macros and I can't believe what a difference it's made. I've been far from perfect. I've just learned how to fuel myself so much better. One day I'll get enough nerve to do a bathing suit shot but that's just not my thing. I snapped this picture today because I stopped wearing that skirt a couple of years ago. It wasn't too flattering. Now it's loose! #celebratingprogress #macrocounting #strongeru #feelinggreat

I took breakfast for dinner to the next level tonight. French toast on leftover French bread and oven baked bacon. Even the 7-year-old said it was good. He never says ANYTHING is good. #winning

I've been counting and tracking macros for the last 12 weeks and I'm super happy with the results so far. I'm down nearly 2 sizes! Big thanks to @dtbaze for helping me figure it all out. I'm planning a post soon about it, but  I just wanted to take a min to celebrate. Those pants have been collecting dust in the back of my closet for a couple of years and today they fit perfectly!

I don't share many pics of him anymore because he's 12 with his own friends and social presence but today I couldn't help myself. 12 is moody, goofy yet, somehow, mature. He's reading for school tomorrow and did it with no complaints for, quite possibly, the first time ever. 13 is a mere months away and I'm bracing for the teen years. He continues to teach me more about myself than I sometimes care to know. I'm not sure if he'll ever comprehend how much he positively changed my life. Watching him grow has already been an amazing experience and I think it's only get more interesting.

Unexpectedly home for lunch because of the weather so I decided to have fun with lunch. 2 frozen mahi mahi fillets steamed in #instantpot with juice of lime, soy sauce and thyme -- 3 minutes.  I then reheated leftover brown rice with a dash of soy sauce, lime juice and thyme and placed the cooked fish fillets on top with a pinch of salt. So good and took all of 10 min!

I DID die of dysentery. The 12-year-old drowned. The Husband and 6-Year-Old both got bitten by snakes. We didn't make it. lol

Ok #instantpot let's do this! Bone-in chuck roast (thanks @gvfarm!) browned right in the pot.  I deglazed with a beer. Then added some spices and such plus onion, potatoes and carrots. Fingers crossed this comes out.  I'm making dinner 6! #livinontheedge #instapotnewbie  #ifiorderapizzalateryoullknowwhy

Absolutely, positively my favorite holiday tradition even when the only time we could do them was mid-week on a work night when I'm utterly exhausted.

This is why I want instruments in the house. :) Side note: I've picked up the guitar tonight for the first time in months -- basically since I went back to a traditional job. I have no time for lessons and I really can't afford them anyway so I just restarted @yousician missions. I forgot how fun it was!

Breakfast for dinner #thanksgivingleftovers style. That's and egg and egg white scramble with bacon, leftover turkey and leftover Brussels Sprouts topped with Siracha, of course. In the back you can see my two mini mashed-potato potato pancakes on the side. So yummy! And a new twist for me that I will make again.

Recommitting to my walks at lunch. There's so much to see here! Today I found a comic book store around the corner and strolled by the Baltimore Basilica so I could go in for a peek.

My new job is in such an amazing part of Baltimore. I need to get back to my lunch time walk habit just so I can use it as an excuse to take pictures. Especially on gorgeous fall days like today.

Not the best picture but I have to share.  I have finally joined the "zoodle" cult and I'm obsessed. I don't have a spiralizer but my local grocery started selling them so I gave them a try. #lifechanging Butternut squash is my favorite so far but those are carrot "noodles" pictured. I made shrimp and broccoli scampi the same way I would for linguine but tossed it with the carrots instead. So friggin' good! I'm sure most of you know this already because I'm late to the party, but I had to share. :) #soyummy

Halloween 2017 The closest thing to a theme we could agree on was animals. We've got a lion, penguin, racoon and shark.

Trying a new parenting technique.  I sometimes leave the kids checklists to do before I come home from work but I'm tired and haven't been doing them soooo... I made them make thier own lists tonight. We taked about what they can do around the house and without screens before I get home. I think this will become a nightly tradition. :)

First pilates class in the books! It's perfect for my recovery. All I have to do is get used to the mirrors (ugh), burning pulses (yikes!) and being humbled by these cute little hand weights. In all seriousness, I modified the core stuff, everything else felt great! My muscles were craving a challenge! #hysterectomy #recovery #day23

Sunday morning cooking soothes my soul. Brown sugar topped banana bread is done, meatballs browning (some for today but most are headed to the freezer), and a pot of homemade sauce on the stove for this weeks Sunday dinner. It all just makes me smile. :)
