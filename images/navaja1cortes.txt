Emmett Louis Till (7/25/41 – 8/28/55) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. The brutality of his murder and the fact that his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. His mother insisted on an open casket.  And to think things haven't changed since then.
