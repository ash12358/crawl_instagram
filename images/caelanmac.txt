A surprisingly warm winter weekend with the #huntresskids means lots of playgrounds and sunshine.

The Winter #Solstice in New Zealand has really made its presence known - we woke up to #frost on the windows, once the sun had risen so comically late. It’s disorienting to flip the Wheel of the Year, and celebrate Yule in June. The seasons themselves seem right, but they don’t track with the calendar as I’m used to. We found ourselves unprepared, and I’m missing our family traditions - Green Chili Stew and a Yule Log burning all night long - but this is only our first #wintersolstice in #newzealand, and it’s supposed to be the darkest and emptiest time of year. I huddle with my family against the cold, and make plans for next year. From here on out, it gets brighter every day. #happysolstice #southernhemisphere #wintersolstice #onwards

“Pain is inevitable. Misery is optional. Put a geranium in your hat and be happy.” I read this last night in ‘The History of New Zealand’ by Michael King, when he quoted a man who went panning for gold in the Otago during the Great Depression, housing his wife and children in a cave while it passed. I’m reminded of this story as I am stranded unexpectedly in Auckland, after my plane nearly landed in Windy Wellington, and missed the runway. During the second attempt at landing, we were struck by lightning, and the pilot gave up trying to land in the storm and came back to Auckland. Unprepared for an overnight trip, and missing my family, I could allow myself to be grumpy and irate, as is my inclination. Instead, I choose to treat these inconveniences as an adventure, so that I can decline the option of misery. Life is more fun this way, and tomorrow, I will be back home, with a great story to tell. I may as well enjoy the adventure in the meantime. Big thanks to @airnz for putting me up in a hotel tonight - it’s much better than a cave in the Otago. #newzealand #stranded #auckland #skytower

The horns on this beast are warm and full of life. He was docile, and let me hold his horn for a long moment, as I marveled at the heat running through them. I have always thought of horns as similar to nails, dead extensions of cartilage or bone, but this friendly beast let me feel the life coursing through his mighty horns.

The strangest thing about having #Easter in the Southern Hemisphere is the flipping of the Wheel of the Year. This is the time for harvest, for reaping the bounty, for emptying the gardens and filling the storehouse. Our traditions, earned in the North, give us the springtime festival of Easter this moon, to celebrate rebirth, renewal, and resurrection, and in the cycle of the seasons where we now live, it’s completely opposite to what Mother Nature is doing around us. All the same, we are hunting for Easter Eggs, eating chocolate, and thanking the natural forces that give us life and abundance. #huntresskids #easter #wheeloftheyear #southernhemisphere

I thank my lucky stars that I get to spend my life with a woman who has so much love to give. My lady wife is the center of our clan, and we all live our lives in orbit around her brilliance. Somehow, from the center, she encircles us with her embrace, always anticipating what would make someone happy, always investigating how to make someone feel better, always supporting us into becoming better versions of ourselves. Her nobility of character impels me to excel, so that I may prove myself worthy of this wonderful gift. Spending my life with her has been my greatest treasure.

My lady wife saith: "There is a traditional New Zealand dessert served on Christmas Day called Pavlova. It's made with meringue, and strawberries, and fresh kiwi fruit, and whipped cream. Do you want to try it?" Me: "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Do with me what you will, my lady, and I will love you for it." And Lo, it was so. She did her great works, and I did love her for them. #christmas #dessert #pavlova #merrychristmas #newzealand #holiday #merryxmas

Three little elves delivering Christmas cheer. The #huntresskids brought presents and cookies and gifts and goodies to surprise our neighbors with joy. These are my favourite exercises and lessons of #homeschooling - do good deeds for your community, because it makes the world better - and it makes you better - when you give.

Drinking #coffee in New Zealand has introduced me to the benefits of Americanos. This drink was invented by Italians in the 40s for American soldiers, who thought the closest they could get to drip coffee with their temperamental espresso machines was to just do an absurdly long pull of espresso. While living in America, I never much cared for Americanos, preferring a dark roast drip coffee over anything an espresso machine could create. But here, in New Zealand, nobody uses a drip coffee machine. Espresso machines are everywhere. Sometimes you can find a French Press (they call it 'plunger' coffee) but drip coffee doesn't exist here. I drink from a French Press at home, but anytime I am out somewhere, I order an Americano, which is a double shot of espresso with added hot water. It's grown on me. Maybe it's because in the absence of drip coffee, this is the closest I can find, and the most suitable for my palate; just like when it was invented in Italy nearly a century ago, for Americans living in a far-off land.

On a boat! Not only our family's first visit to the South Island of #newzealand - it is also the first time our kids have ever been on a boat. They have traveled the world, lived in different countries, crossed oceans in the sky - and somehow, they have never been on a boat until today.

This is not the first #thanksgiving we have spent outside the US, but it is the first in a long while that we have not prepared a Thanksgiving feast. Instead, we are ordering Indian "takeaway" (what they call "to-go" or "carry-out" in #newzealand) in order to preserve our energy, time, and resources for a trip this weekend, celebrating my lady wife's 40th birthday. With family visiting us this week, I wanted some sort of #gratitude exercise, to share my gratefuls and to hear theirs. Thankfully, there is the #Thanksgivingreader at www.thethanksgivingreader.com. Many thanks to @sethgodin for writing it, and Toku @unexecutive for telling me about it in his newsletter this morning. #happythanksgiving #expat #holiday #givingthanks

This guy is now old enough to take longer bike rides with me, and he loves it. On Sunday morning we set off, not knowing where we were going, or when we were coming back. We went across the city, following the river along a beautiful cycling path together, exploring the local landmarks and natural wonders. To turn the adventure into an educational lesson, when we got back home I showed him how to make a map on Google Earth with placement markers showing where we had been, and how to print that map from the computer. Then we sat with a marker and traced our route, imprinting the memories of where we had been within the contours of our local roads. Exercise, cartography, orienteering and computer skills - it was a good #homeschooling day.

Travel tip: ABC - Always Be Charging. Traveling with 3 kids on a five day international trip, there have been iPhones, laptops, and tablets to juggle, and running out of charge on a device means that I lose my most effective mood management machine for that kid. Whenever there is a layover and an electric socket, I open up my charging pouch and plug in everything that I can. When the plugs change in different countries, my equipment increases. Here's my best pro tip: always fold and tie each cord, before putting it away into a dedicated pouch (or pocket) that is just for charging accessories. That way, your cords don't get tangled in transit, and you don't have to hunt around to find them when you have a moment to recharge. #traveltips #internationaltravel #travelwithkids #chargingcable #travelhacks #rechargetime #worldschooling #traveltech

Since my plane lands in North America exactly one hour after the #equinox, I have changed seasons by traveling from winter into fall! This is a day of balance and transition.

Walking around Wellington on a warm winter's day, and everyone is smiling at the waterfront. Just a few days ago, it was windy and blustery and miserable - and now, it is sunny and beautiful, and everyone enjoys it even more because of the distance between the extremes. Hunger makes the best sauce.

You know how when you're renewing passports for three children, and you get all the original birth certificates and documents into one folder, you spill a whole cup of coffee all over them? Yeah, this is just like that. I hope the coffee stains on the applications count as extra Portland cred.

This massive tome is a handbook for excellence. (If you have really big hands.) @timferriss has given us 673 pages of concentrated wisdom, distilled from the 200+ conversations on his podcast, and delivered in a highly digestible format. This is the best of the best. If you are looking for a #fathersday present for a man in your life, this is the one that will level him up. I've had this book four days and it has already improved my life in three significant ways, and I'm delighted there is so much more to study. #excellence #productivity #lifehacking #highperformance #bookreview #toolsofthetrade #toolsoftitans

An #APA, I have just learned, is an American Pale Ale. A powerful, #hoppy #beer with a massive afterglow. From the label: "This is an All-American show with Centennial, Citra and Simcoe overwhelming your nose, kicking you in the taste buds, and departing with more bitterness than a Palm Springs divorce." Brewed in Upper Hutt, #newzealand and I love the #logo. #panhead #supercharger #brewing #greatbeer

The ideas in New Zealand - they are unlike anything I've ever seen. This is a completely self-contained canvas, with less than a thousand years of human population, and situated so far from the rest of the world, that ideas...percolate here. They ferment in a manner that is different than the rest of the world, where ideas are subject to interference across borders. This place is sequestered, in such a way that the integrity of the activities in this terrarium are protected from the outside world, allowing ideas to blossom here uncorrupted. #newzealand #wallflower #innovation

Hanging from the ceiling of the Wellington airport in #newzealand is a life-size replica of #Gandalf the Grey riding on the back of a giant eagle. Remember when he said, "Fly, you fools!" just before disappearing into the abyss? He was trying to give the Fellowship a hint of his secret plan: get through the tunnel, emerge on the other side of the mountain range, meet the giant eagles and drop the One Ring into Mount Doom. Unfortunately, in his battle with the Balrog, after Gandalf proclaimed "You shall not pass!" he dropped Glamdring, his magic sword. Even though he bested the Balrog, and the Fellowship was safely on their way, he crawled up to the edge of the abyss, and gave them the portentous hint they didn't understand: "Fly, you fools!" And then he left the Fellowship to voluntarily plunge into the abyss after the Balrog to get his sword. Gandalf risked the entire mission, and left the fate of the world to two hobbits, instead of securely bringing the Fellowship to the giant eagles and saving the world that way - because he really, really liked his sword. I think of that every time I have seen pictures of this magnificent statue, and today I got to see it in person. #LOTR #wellington #mightyeagle #statue #lordoftherings

Taking the #huntresskids to the theatre is not only good #homeschooling, it is also super fun. Now that they are all old enough to (mostly) sit still for an hour of live performance, we can watch a play like Robin Hood (performed excellently by @nwchildrenstheater) and then go home with library books about the legendary brigand. We talked about poaching, taxes, the rule of law, and the moral confusion of living under unjust rulers. "Is Robin Hood a bad guy, or a good guy?" launches us into an ethical discussion about right and wrong that makes me so proud of these growing philosophers. #robinhood #ethics #theatre #kidstheatre #goodandbad #rightandwrong #lifelessons

The best part is, I didn't even get mad. On the first day of Mercury Retrograde, I broke the screen of my phone while doing handstands. My very first thought (while still inverted) was, "Oh, good. That busted phone I have at home has a working screen. I can make the replacement into a homeschooling project!" I regained my feet and went to propose a new educational project to my kids, never once getting upset about the accident.

I met my lady wife at Coffee Time. We both worked there, for six months, without ever meeting each other - I worked the graveyard shift, and she worked afternoons. We had the same friends, went to the same parties, and even lived in the same building across the street - but we never met, dodging each other's existence until the time was just right. Sitting at this very spot, a few days before my roommate and I were to host a cocktail party (the first time I could legally host a drinking event) I realized, I had no date for my own party! But I didn't want to date, I was so worn down by women at the time; I decided what I really wanted was a woman who would look great on my arm, but wouldn't date me. Someone way out of my league, too beautiful to take me seriously, but could be charmed into a single date. Just as I had this thought, as if by magic, this woman way too beautiful to take me seriously pulled up to the curb. Embolden by my new decision, I asked her if she would be my date to a New Years Eve Eve party I was hosting in a couple days to celebrate the turn of the new millennium. She said yes, knowing her own recent commitment, to swear off dating until she found the man she would marry, would keep the evening trivial. To the surprise of both of us, we fell in love, and it's been a fairy tale ever since. Whenever I pass this spot in Portland, I bow to the moment our romance began, and I give thanks for the serendipity that kept us apart until the time was just right. #portland #lovestory #coffeetime

The #huntresskids on #easter 2017 went over the river and through the woods for a fancy brunch at Grandma's house, with an Easter egg #treasurehunt after giving pretty bags of jellybeans to dozens of perfect strangers. Spreading #love and #kindness is their #homeschooling prerequisite.

Yesterday was super fun. This was the first #aprilfoolsday that the #huntresskids really started developing their own pranks. Salt in my coffee, a fried egg disguise, fake dog poop in the hallway, and more unexpected farts than ever before. What a fun day. All the #creativity counts as #homeschooling projects, because they practiced their ingenuity and subterfuge. #lifelessons #aprilfools #whoopeecushion #pranks

My favorite wander downtown is through Powell's bookstore, looking for some random volume I haven't been able to locate anywhere. It's actually a rush when they don't have what I'm seeking; for a bibliophile, this is like a gambler beating the house. I know I can go online and locate any book if I really want it, but I treasure these idle meanderings in search of a book I don't truly need, but the idea of at least browsing through that book's pages has captured enough of my interest to serve as the goal of a quest that takes me on a journey through thousands of bookshelves. @powellsbooks is a favorite @portland #adventure. #pdx #portland #bookstore #bibliophile #quest

My daughter learned Photoshop with this fairy book. The CD has files full of fairies, with layers you can mix and match to swap out arms and legs, faces, wings, and outfits. When I showed her how to add colors to the elements, she crowed with joy and pushed me out of the way so she could dive in and create her art digitally for the first time. And then, after three hours of gleeful creation, she started weeping when her drawing broke and she couldn't fix it. "This is part of being an artist," I had to tell her.

Minecraft joke for parents: my son saw this sign and said, "Do creepers hang out in there?" I answered, "...yes. How do you know about creepers?" He says, "In Minecraft, if a creeper gets too close to you they explode, and destroy what you're building. So they would love to hang out in...the Boom Boom Room!" He laughed uproariously, and I grinned sidelong at my wife, "You're right, kid. Creepers hang out in the Boom Boom Room."

When the old German lady stopped us at Trader Joe's in the wine aisle, she pointed to this. "Mulled wine," she said, "it keeps the colds away. This is what you want to drink." And Lo, she was totally right - it is delicious. Perfect for the season. Grab a bottle, heat it up in a pan, mix in some cayenne pepper - it tastes like the warmer side of December.

Fifteen years ago, I was in a play with Laura Lou. She told me about a school called Dell'Arte, and a year later I went to study physical theater there. It was one of the most formative experiences of my life, and I have this funny girl to thank for it.

Rub-a-dub-dub, three #huntresskids in a tire swing. Their #imagination makes it a pirate ship, and here they have a lull between storms, eating cookies as their booty and assigning roles and plot points to each other. As the storm comes in, Daddy pushes them about, while they howl with delight. I love to eavesdrop on their story play, so I can marvel at the deftness of their minds.

Today Taos and I had the best time. We went hunting for the Hulkbuster Lego set, and between the four toy stores where we went looking for it, we had lunch at a big fountain, swung on swings, jumped on trampolines, and went exploring, just the two of us. The youngest child can be folded into the pack so often, following along in footsteps or moving with the group, that they don't get as much solo time as the older kids do. When I carve out this time for him, I get to see a side of him that only shows itself after an afternoon of exclusivity. He's not competing for attention with his siblings, or following along with their games; today he got to be the only kid for a while, and his independence really blossomed. When he had a notion to visit something nearby or do something different, he didn't have to convince his elder siblings, he just had to ask his sidekick parent. I relish these solo outings with him, because I really like this kid. We have some serious fun together. #huntresskids

Easter brunch with the family. The #huntresskids are all old enough to behave with genteel manners at a fancy restaurant; for the first time, we didn't have to take frequent breaks to let a toddler explore. They sat quietly, participated in conversations, and I don't think I ever had to shush anyone once. All those years of struggling to be civilized have paid off - now we can enjoy a nice meal like normal people, and not like babysitters.

"To be luckier, take better chances." In the upcoming #bornforthisbook Chris Guillebeau lays out the mechanics of improving your luck, both in careers and in life. "Stop playing the numbers game," he says, "and start playing a game that actually improves your odds."

"You don't need to make small changes; you need to level up. This book is designed to help you do just that." #bornforthisbook by @193countries is his best yet. It's got me looking at my work in the world in a whole new way.

"If you want momentum, you'll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started." - Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is The Way. This book is a fantastic a collection of Stoic philosophies, punctuated with stories from historical figures applying these principles - however, what I find really amazing is it's similarity to the philosophy of l'art du déplacement. In #parkour, we do not see an obstacle as an impairment to movement. Indeed, it is the obstacles that make the movements worthwhile. Seeing obstacles as the stepping-stones of your path gives you confidence and agility in dealing with anything that life places in your way.

I'm gonna miss this guy. @stevenshewach is off to roam the globe, and while I'm grateful that we've become such close friends while he was in Portland, the price for that is feeling really lonely now that he's gone. I love you, man. Enjoy your adventures, and make a few bad decisions, so you'll have some great stories to tell when you come back around.

"Simply understanding how #habits work - learning the structure of the habit loop - makes them easier to control. Once you break a #habit into it's components, you can fiddle with the gears." - from The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. He says that if you identify the Cue and the Reward of a habit you want to change, practicing a new Routine between those two will smoothly replace the old habit with the new one.
