Yesterday was incredible. We took the WB #HarryPotter Studio tour. It’s the actual backlot, with the actual sets, props, costumes, makeup, designs and so on. I was in awe. It took tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of hours to make these films and this is a celebration of all that work. Remember, there are so many jobs in entertainment and media, and they’re all valuable! . We stood in the actual great hall (smaller than you think), peeked in Hagrid’s Hut, saw the actual invisibility cloak, and marveled at the white card models and drawings of every major set piece and production item. Thousands of costumes, hundreds of thousands of props. Geez it was cool. . Something you might not know about me, when I was young my parents only let me watch 1 hour of TV a day. I had to pick the shows in advance and then had a schedule that was printed and placed in the living room. I chose movie magic, science, education, and history programs on The Learning and Discovery channels. So seeing the robots, the costumes, and the set designs with stories about how they were created? I was speechless the whole day. Agape. I loved it. If you can go. Go. :) . . #verytravel #hp #london #suchlondon #wbtourlondon #bts #movies #film #filmindustry #somanyjobs #wow #behindthescenes #iloveproduction

I took this yesterday on the Metro as we stopped in the tunnel. IT WAS SO HOT, but no one said anything. We all just endured while a nice-sounding conductor casually talked for a few minutes. Then we sat in silence before jerking back to life, and continuing on our way. I love Paris. // Parisians inaugurated their Metro on July 19, 1900, just in time for the World Exposition. It was built by 3,500 workers who froze the ground to drill beneath the Seine, sank sections of prefabricated tunnel into the riverbed and ripped up paving stones, turning boulevards into vast open wounds. The Metro was quickly adopted by Parisians, becoming an alternately adored and reviled -- but ultimately inescapable -- feature of French collective consciousness. — quote via @nytimes pic via me yesterday #paris #france #verytravel #metro #publictransit #humansofparis #🇫🇷

On this #EarthDay rememeber it’s not about the weather, it’s not about your lawn, it’s not about your community, it’s not about your country... It’s about all those things! It’s about how each small piece of our environment are pieces in the great puzzle of planet #earth. Every piece matters. If one burns up, gets lost, or is all soggy, the whole puzzle is ruined. Protect your piece! Love it. #happyearthday!

Yesterday, I stumbled upon an, almost literally, hole-in-the-wall place that sells handkerchief-wrapped lunches with amazingly fresh fish. You can eat “for here” and they gesture to a three-foot wide hallway where you stand at a ledge and enjoy huge fresh chunks of tuna. What a weird and pleasant experience…

“Out of a mountain of despair, a stone of hope.” The first time I saw this I knew it was a triumph of our nation. The voice of an American who railed, and raillied, and rose up against those in power, shares the same field as Jefferson, Washington and others. . These are the voices of our country, and they are all equal. They all had dreams. They all fought for what they knew was right. They all changed the face of this great nation. #MLK50 #blacklivesmatter #dc #bnw #blackandwhite #noir #nightshot

Happy #Spring!! I spotted this crazy patch of clover near my house, and thought... #scicomm opportunity! Clover is a far more interesting plant than I realized. They’re an abundant crop harvested for livestock feed, and have at least 300 species ranging in color. They’re found in red, white, yellow and purple. ⠀ 🍀⠀ Normally they have three leaves (or leaflets), but an inherited gene mutation creates a four-leafed clover and occurs every 10,000 plants. Ten thousand may sound like a lot, but there could be a few in THIS PATCH, because clover grow so densely that 10,000 can fit in just a few square meters!⠀ 🔬⠀ BTW, the mutation that causes four leaflet growth isn’t their only one — there are also fives and more! The world record is 56 leaflets! I keep saying leaflets though because (technically) all clover are ONE LEAFED. See, the little leaflets aren’t classified as leaves on their own, but as a whole the leaflets combine to make one leaf for the clover plant (it has to do with how leaves combine to attach to the stem and is common in lots of flora).⠀ ☘️⠀ One last thing, a four-leafed clover is fun, but it’s different from a SHAMROCK which a symbol for Ireland. Shamrocks have three leaves, never four, symbolizing the Holy Trinity (whatever that is 😉). ⠀ ☀️⠀ I hope the snow lets up for you, or at least you get to play in it one more time before spring… well, springs. Thanks to #JohnniewalkerUS for sponsoring this post. #ad. @jonniewalkerUS ⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #seasons #green #plants #nature #clover #🍀 #☘️ #☘️☘️ #greenisle #WhiskeyWednesday

I was in #Detroit last weekend. I grew up in the state, but not near the city. Whenever anyone talked about it in the 90s, they prefaced with how dangerous, decrepit, or corrupt it was — but the city I saw this weekend was beautiful and bright. It’s filled with hard-working and friendly people, small businesses, great food, and gorgeous architecture. (It was also cold as heck!) . This statue is called The Spirit of Detroit, and it’s always fascinated me. It’s representing a man with a god in one hand and a family in another. It represents this place, one of the oldest American cities, and says to me that Detroit is a family. . Good luck, fair city. #detroithustlesharder.

We’re moving offices in a month, so the space that held @revision3, #DiscoveryDigitalNetworks and now @seeker is being slowly dismantled.

Not a bad way to end the year. #bye2017 #happynewyear! I love you all. I’m going to #junkanoo tonight, a Carnival-like Street Party in Nassau, it starts at 2am and goes till 10. 😳😵 Midnight will be a speed bump.

Bye 2017! 👋🏼 There was good. There was bad. There was crazy. There was mad. But in the end, at least we weren’t alone on this space rock. I hope your 2018 shines! #bestnine2017

#SouthBeach: the first time i came here i stayed in a crap hotel, with five people in two beds. That was eight years ago. To be honest, recalling how we five poor grad students tried to squeeze every penny out of #Miami, conjures up some of my happiest memories of this place! Ain’t life funny? . . . Now, years later, it’s a little more dilapidated, more are businesses closed, and more rich people have high-rises with private beaches. America is getting sadder, but not because we’re not great. Instead, because some people think being great is having a Ferrari or denying someone else access. What great really is, is a healthy neighborhood, and strong sense of national purpose. . . #florida #fl #clubs #restaurant #dusk #sunset #verytravel #classiccar #chevy #hotel @travelchannel #palmtrees #streetphotography #streetscenes #artdeco #architecture #lights #streets

The air smells of campfire. It’s conflicting to be surrounded by a smell with a happy connotation, with these beautiful sunsets, but know it’s caused by suffering. Thinking of #norcalfires every day.

Here's #Voyager1 celebrating 40 years in space today. The blue dot is Earth -- magnified to be larger than the sun. This piece of technology is a message. A beacon. It's telling the universe, "We're here! And here's what we are." I love the science and the romance of it all.

Brit me baby, 100 feet high! 🎶 . . . #nyc #ny #verytravel #timessquare #justpassingthru #america #sobright #blur I took a few pictures of #TimesSquare as we drove through and honestly, this was the best. When it's clear you see the filth, cars and crowds… this is more accurate to my memory.

Heading out for #SuburbSaturday and caught a quick sunny view of the tall buildings downtown. That salesforce tower is terrible. . . . #sf #city #hellocity #blueskies #tallbuildings #igotnothing #sometimesapictureisjustpretty (the people inside the tower are nice!)

I love going to local comedy shows. It’s like the people who are funny on the internet, but for real. Went to see my work buddy, @mattmorales, and he is damn funny! There were other comics too. Some high. Some drunk. Some funny. Others less funny. How like the internet.

Six years ago this week the #spacecoast saw its very last space shuttle launch. On the drive from Titusville, Florida, to our campsite at @waltdisneyworld. We stopped at “Swampy” an incredible gator-themed tourist trap and got a stranger to snap this photo. I miss these babies. This was the best #roadtrip I’ve been on to date. Maybe we should try and top it? . . . #america #touristtrap #roadsideamerica #dc #florida #fl #verytravel #tbt #gators

Left: last night’s anniversary dinner. WOW! So good. Right: #tbt to four years ago, you were in NY and I was moving to SF… and we went for it anyway. I’m so happy we did. Now I say, “Four more years! Four more years!”

Of course when I crash my scooter I end up at a children’s hospital. BONUS: they laugh at all my jokes!
