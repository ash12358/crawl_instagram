Holy moly, it’s 3 p.m. and I nearly forgot about my Gratitude Challenge ALREADY. This one will be short and sweet because it’s hot AF in NYC and tourists have been walking in front of me slowly all day. Plus it’s FRIYAY and I get to see @caiteoh @ashleysalz for dinner tonight so I have ants in my pants til I can see them. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ In spite of the heat, humidity and slow walkin’ folk I am super grateful for these following things 🍝 Getting to have lunch with my great friend @caliserobert at @eatalyNYC today. We were @YEC’s earliest employees and have seen each other through *alotta* stuff. I’m very lucky for his friendship and unwavering support and the fact that he picked up the check at lunch because my delicious, chilled Lambrusco was not cheap and #startuplife ya know! Thanks Bob-o. 🗽 New York City, even in all of her humid, sweaty glory. Before I moved to Boston, NYC stressed me out for a while. It was loud and it was chaotic. I’ve returned with a new lense and choose to see the magic in all of these people and all of this chaos, everyone hustling to where they need to be and get sh*t done. The opportunity here > slow walkers! And I am grateful for all of it. 👩‍🏫 I am grateful for Elisa Miller-Out, longtime friend and now advisor to my company @raisewithbax. She’s a serial entrepreneur, wonderful woman and now investing in female led tech companies with @ChloeCapital. She’s joining the BAX community on Monday to lead a pitch workshop and I can’t wait for our fundraising #founders to learn from her! Thank you, Elisa! 🙌 Last but not least, for my rad friends @sunnybonnell @ashleigh_hansberger for letting me crash in their @wearemotto offices!! If you need #branding help, hit them up. World class creatives and awesome ladies. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #Gratitude #HappyFriday #NYC #founders #entrepreneur #mindfulness

#GratitudeChallenge Day 1 was a success! I was thrilled to see many of my mom’s friends comments expressing their appreciation for her. She didn’t know I was making the post + it was a nice surprise for her to see during the day while at work. MB School of Life Rule #237: When you think something nice about someone, or want to compliment them, tell them!! Even if it’s a stranger. If they think you’re a weirdo, that’s on them. But they probably will just smile big, say THANK YOU + have a better day because of it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Things I am grateful for today 🐶 Our dog, Chewie Murphy. Chewie makes me SO happy just by looking at him. He’s been with us these last few days because my dad is away, he sleeps with me + follows me around the house + wants to make sure no one else is leaving and does this new thing where he rests his head on your lap to get your attention. He’s just a fluffy puddle of love + I hope everyone has a Chewie in their life. 🤳 Group texts w/ best girlfriends, I have a few of them and am very lucky. w/ OGs @caiteoh + @ashleysalz, w/ my Hype Girls @rachaelgking @lisaframe @ms.vixxen + this AM I woke up to a flurry of texts from 7 College Street ladies @livho10 @spowers7 @claudiajimenez8 @srussell868 @caiteoh with lots of exciting news!! :D Sometimes I feel overloaded by all of the notifications, forms of messaging, ways people can get a hold of you etc but mostly I am grateful that it’s so easy to keep in touch with all these wonderful ladies that I love! 🛍️ My colorful, “social butterfly” carry on suitcase that has taken quite the beating over the last 3+ years. I just finally unpacked up it from MDW weekend + about to turn right around to pack for a night in the city and another day upstate with lots of family. I’ve never seen another one like it, so I always know it’s mine. (@theamydee once said it was like a bad tattoo lmao 😂) It fits a ton of stuff, even though I always try my hardest not to overpack but always do. It’s gotten me everywhere I’ve needed to go + shows no signs of breaking on me anytime soon. Plus, it was like 30 bucks at Marshalls!! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Day 2 down! Comment below with what you are grateful for today 🙏 #Gratitude

30 Day #Gratitude Challenge 💫 I turn 30 on June 22, which means that I’ve been thinking a lot about…well, being 30. I wanted to do something to mark the occasion in a positive, creative way. I was going to start June 1st but no time like the present, right? And kicking off a 30 Day Gratitude Challenge in honor of my 30th birthday on May 30th just sounds good (I have a thing with numbers ⚡ 11:11, 22, and 3:33…wait, whoa, 333! See!) Anyway, I’m challenging myself to share AT LEAST 3 things I am grateful for everyday for the next 30 days, maybe with a side of commentary on how I’m experiencing this work. I’d love if you joined me. Let’s go…🌈 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ❤️ My mom! I am grateful for my mom all days but the world deserves to know. We had a Mother/Daughter getaway this past weekend to the Catskills + Hudson Valley. My favorite times with her were in the car, “Roadtrip!” she always exclaims, or getting way too excited about an incredible list of desserts at a cute cafe in Saugerties. We shared the Lemon Tart with roasted lemon ice cream and the Strawberry Rhubarb with pistachio brittle and graham cracker crusts. Holymoly. She is the most supportive, patient, understanding person on the planet. ☘️ My Irish heritage. With my mom this weekend, we went to an Irish Fest that has been happening in the Catskills for 40 years. We stayed at a hotel owned and operated by a young Irish family, and it truly felt like we were staying in their home. We saw live music every night — incredibly talented musicians, singers, dancers and storytellers — alongside fellow freckled folks ranging from a few months old to 90 years+. In a room full of a Irish strangers, everyone somehow feels like family. 🌝 This cover of The Cranberries “Dreams” by Japanese Breakfast I found on @Spotify this AM. This is one of my all time favorite songs and it was such a delight to stumble upon it this morning. I guess this also ties into my Irish heritage, as well! Has anyone ever seen someone use “Dreams” for their first dance at a wedding? Asking for a friend. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Day 1 down! I’d love if you’d comment below w/ something you are grateful for today 🙏

Tonight I am spending #NYE resting, restoring and brainstorming for an epic #2018. I thought I’d spend the whole day in my sweat pants until I got a text from my brother, “What are you doing tonight?” I knew immediately that I had to muster up the energy, *paint my face*, and hit the town to spend the last few hours of the year with my “little” brother and best friends that feel like family. I am grateful to have an extended family, people like JB and the Andreassi’s, that now matter how much time passes are always curious about what you’re up to, wondering how they can be of help and only want the best for you. After a delicious dinner, a few cocktails and well wishes, I left the boys in the city to go do their thing while I do mine in cozy socks and a messy bun. I’m closing out the year feeling loved, being inspired and supported, doing what I want (aka absolutely nothing!!) and knowing that 2018 can’t wait to hear what I’m up to, wants to know how it can help and that it only wants the best for me. 🥂🕺🏻💕⭐️

Here’s my favorite photo from #Christmas: (some of) my family gathered ‘round, laughing, watching the @wetribute video everyone participated in as a gift to my mom. 30+ of the most wonderful, generous people in our lives submitted videos to share their gratitude and appreciation for my mom. (That’s her on the right, crying. She cried all day but that’s what we wanted! 😋) It is truly the best gift ever and I highly encourage anyone seeking something extra special to make a Tribute for their loved one. 🎁 @itsandrewhorn has created a delightful service / product and I hope that one day soon everyone is making Tributes. . . Even if you don’t make a Tribute, be sure to make the time in your day to tell the people in your life how much you appreciate them. My mom loved her Tribute so much and exclaimed, “It’s wonderful because usually people don’t say these things until you’re dead! And I’m alive! And everything they said is true!” 😂 . .  I think my favorite thing that anyone had to say about my mom was what my aunt Ann Marie shared. “You are the personification of grace under pressure. I even Googled what ‘grace under pressure’ is - it’s courage.” Who is the most courageous person you know? Tell them today. ❤️ . .  Thank you to everyone who participated in my mom’s Tribute and helped make this Christmas the best one ever! #gratitude #thankful #family #mom #bestmomever #tribute #joy

Though I work in an industry dominated by men, every now and then there is a powerful women that’s comes along who I instantly recognize as an ally and friend. @rachaelgking and I had been “Facebook friends” for three years (thanks @caliserobert !!) before we serendipitously connected in person. It’s been a year and a half of epic lady friendship and it culminated tonight in a conversation we were having around dating and balancing masculine / feminine energies in relationships. While simultaneously, for some reason, we found ourselves  validating the reasons we could possibly be in a relationship with a handsome, smart, funny, successful man who wants to serve us — we came to the realization that “we have everything.” With the power of a truly badass, best friend by your side, it lets you know that... I Am Enough.

I got to spend some time today with this guy, @prestonsmiles. If you don’t know who Preston is yet, remember his name because this will not be the last time you hear it. Preston and his wonderful wife and #PartnerinShine,  @alexipanos will be household names, you have my word. 🤩 This past April, I took the leap to join P’s 2nd ever #Stretch22 class. (Thanks to my girl @moniquebenabou for sharing P with the world and introducing me!) I worked with Preston and our Stretch #tribe for 6 months on everything from money to dating to health to spirituality. We went IN. 💥Joining Stretch was my first step, in a major way, of taking care of *me* and pulling away all the layers, undoing all the programming, rewriting all the stories and discovering my purpose and power. 🦋 We all already the tools we need to succeed and shine our light — sometimes you just need a little help from a person, or a group, of people who are also ready to step their game up. I encourage everyone to cultivate their community, their tribe, in whatever shape that takes. (Maybe it’s Stretch 22 Class 3 — I hear there night still be a couple spots open 😉) ✨ Stretch may have ended in September, but “the work” continues every day. I am eternally grateful to Preston and Stretch family for showing up, breaking themselves open and pouring their love into the world. 💕 Quit playing small. Know that you have everything you need right now within you. Be intentional with your word and be loving in your actions. We got this. 🙏✌️💜

I remember the day @caiteoh met Harry Brady. This lady just knew he was her man! I could rave forever about the two of them, they know I feel, and their wedding weekend was just a reflection of the love and generosity they show to their friends and family. My girl had a VISION for their wedding weekend and it was executed beyond everyone's dreams! From the food to the music to the speeches, to our dresses and THE dress, and celebrating at the O'Neill family home, everything was just perfect. I love you Cait and Harry, congratulations Mr. & Mrs. Brady!!! ❤️#CaityGoesBrady #mybestfriendswedding #NotOurWedding #IChooseYou

Going Home to #NewYork // *long post alert* I'm just 6 weeks shy of having lived in Boston for 5 years. It was Labor Day weekend 2012 when I was visiting @srussell868 @spowers7 and their families in Shrewsbury, MA. That weekend was a turning point in my life as personal chaos and uncertainty reached its peak back at home. I knew I needed time away from New York, and my kind friends in Shrewsbury and their extended network in Boston (@k8thedate @nhutson22 )seemed like the softest place to land. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made because though I knew I needed to separate myself, I felt like I was abandoning my family when I was needed most. I was extremely fortunate that my best friend, @caiteoh, was also open to taking the leap and provided me with the means to make the move happen. Within a couple of weeks, we were off - no jobs and not sure what might lie ahead. Of course, it took time for things to fall into place, but ultimately what I found was a city and a community that was the calming force I needed. Obviously, finding @ryanpaugh (and Scott Gerber back in NY) through a series of incredible small world connections (thank you, @caitlinmc!) and joining team YEC was the hands down the best thing that has happened to me in my professional life. So fortunate that many of the great friendships I have here in Boston are because of my job. "Cool friends who do cool shit," as I call it. So fortunate they are letting me continue my work with @YEC / CommunityCo from New York so I can better serve our members there and continue to build epic communities with them while I reconnect with my roots, spend time with my family and oldest friends. I never, ever had plans to go back to New York. In fact, most of the time I was asked I'd say "Never." (You know that they say....) In June when my mom suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a stroke, essentially - I knew where I needed to be. Thank God that she is okay (and OK'd me mentioning this publicly!) but ultimately I felt called to be close to  home and once again followed my gut, and made decisions quickly. Post cont'd in comments... ❤️

The best kind of friendships are fierce lady friendships where you aggressively believe in each other, defend each other, and think the other deserves the world. 💕 No best friend is more exemplary of that than @caiteoh. That's why we were delighted to celebrate one of her last days as a #singlelady 💃🏻through the rose gardens and vineyards of the #NorthFork, drinking all the wine we could handle, dancing whenever we got the chance and laughing till we cried. We love you, Cait, and we're so happy you found your Prince. 💍#CaityGoesBrady #PrinceHarry

Yesterday was just one of those days when the vibes are high and everything is awesome. Getting to spend hours drinking, laughing, dancing and listening to music with people that I love and adore is my #1 favorite thing to do. I took this pic yesterday of the wall at Drink in Fort Point, and it perfectly exemplifies the day. It's from Trader Vic's Bartender Guide which is now out of print but I'm going to get my hands on a copy!! Carry it and enjoy it, my friends!

My moms house had a big flood in the basement which sadly ruined a lot of things our family had been to holding onto over the years. Fortunately, there have been lots of photos recovered that we all forgot about and are so grateful to reminisce over again.
