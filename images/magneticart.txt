For Those Who Hurt On Mother’s Day Mother’s Day. For many people that means flowers and handmade cards and Sunday brunches and waves of laughter. It means celebration and gratitude and warm embraces and great rejoicing. It means resting fully in all that is good about loving and being loved. But not for some people. For some it only means tears. For some it just hurts. In the hearts of many, this day is a bitter, unsolicited reminder of what was but no longer is, or a heavy holiday of mourning what never was at all. Maybe it is such a day for you. It might bring with it the scalding sting of grief for the empty chair around a table. It might come with choking regret for a relationship that has been severed. It might be a day of looking around at other mothers and other children, and feeling the unwelcome intrusion of jealousy that comes with comparison. It might be yet another occasion to lament the mistakes you made or the words you didn’t say or the kindness you never knew. It might be an annual injury you sustain. Consider this a personal love letter to you who are struggling today; you whose Mother’s Day experience might be rather bittersweet— or perhaps only bitter. This is consent to feel fully the contents of your own heart without censorship or guilt or alteration. If you are hurting, then hurt. May you feel permission to cry, to grieve, to be not alright. May you relieve yourself of the burden of pretending everything is fine or faking stability or concealing the damage. May you feel not a trace of guilt for any twinge of pain or anger that seizes you today, because it is your right to feel. Above all though, may you find encouragement even in your profound anguish. May you find in your very sadness, the proof that your heart though badly broken, still works. Let the pain you are enduring reassure you that you still have the capacity to care deeply, despite how difficult it has been. See your grief as the terrible tax on loving people well, and see your unquenched longing for something better as a reminder of the goodness within you that desires a soft place to land.

I recently received this lens from a nice lady whose grandfather was a successful photographer in the New York area and used this very glass in his portraiture studio at the beginning of last century. The lens is a Bausch and Lomb 500mm f4.5 and it is not in pristine conditions ( the original owner dates it circa 1918) but it is still a great performer. It's mounted on a 9x9 inch lens board coupled to the largest Packard shutter I have ever come across, with an large opening of over 5 inches in diameter. Not owning a studio camera accepting such a large lens board (such an ANSCO or similar) and curious to test the lens, I crudely strapped the beastly optic to a tripod strong enough to sustain the 15 pounds it weights, and then built out of black velveteen, a rudimentary bag bellows to attach the contraption to the front standard of my 8x10 Deardorff camera. This is the fist test shot I made on paper negative. Extremely happy with the portraiture potential of this lens, I shall keep experimenting with it, while actively looking around for a camera accepting a 9x9 lens boards and retaining at least some degree of portability. #largeformat #heavylens #fifteenpoundslens #portraitlens #portraiture #oldlens

For a long time I wanted to use my 4x5 and 8x10 lenses on a smaller film format, specifically 6x9, with the ease of a focal plane shutter and enough bellows extension to focus. Finally yesterday I found the time to mount on the back of an old Burke and James 4x5 camera a 6x9 Graflex back I had banging around for the longest time. Very pleased with this simple mod, also considering that this little Graflex focal plane shutter can reliably go all the way up to 1/600th of a second, and that is without stressing the tension excessively.  Another positive note is that the B&J camera, with its 5x5 lens board accommodates larger lenses such as the 14"inch Verito, the Kodak Portrait (as pictured) or the 50cm Jena, giving me very interesting results on the smaller (6x9) film size. #graflex #cameramod #largeformat #mediumformat

SHOOTING DRY GLASS PLATES In the rapidly shrinking landscape of film stocks and, by now, the lonely desert of instant film availability, I thought it was time to experiment with oblique strategies (as always preached by Brian Eno). So I was most interested to discover another pioneer of a much needed anti-technocracy renaissance who is producing glass plates. It is only the beginning of production and there are still flaws in the coating of the plates as you can see from my image, but that is surely bound to be solved in future batches. I am very excited by the results. I only tested half a dozen plates, so far, but the results are very encouraging, and certainly worth further experimenting. This is indeed a viable alternative for me to the usual orthochromatic film I use for my portraiture. The modus operandi is very straight forward, something that was never so with the various attempts to re-produce polaroid-like instant films, after the demise of Polaroid. If you want to give it a go, here's the producer, a very friendly and professional manufacturer with an impeccable customer care: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Pictoriographica?ref=l2-shopheader-name Exposed with 1 pop of 1200W/sec strobe in a soft box at 1ft from face of subject.

A great start of 2018 with a portraiture sitting with my good friend Peter. BEST wishes for 2018 to ALL !! #largeformat #portraiture #2018

What is 2018 going to bring us ? Hard to predict. Personally, I wish good health to all. Politically I wish for the removal of the gang of criminals at the helm of my country, although I am aware that would be just a first step towards rebuilding civic decency and far more than that needs to be done. Socially I wish for more human interactivity among us and less social media(tion). Remember how good it was getting together and doing things together ? I still do. Photographically, I wish for good light and at least six remarkable photos in the new year. (yes you heard right: six. And that's a lot already, believe me.) There are several other things I wish for, in the New Year, but I'll keep them to myself for now. Perhaps we can discuss them, face to face, next time we get together. Peace and love to all.

S.S. MARIA del TINDARI "Nigra Sum Sed (Et) Formosa. HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ONE AND ALL (from the article The Global Consequences of Mistranslation: The Adoption ofthe “Black but …” Formulation in Europe, 1440–1650 by Kate Lowe) This article investigates the genesis of a linguistic model occasioned by a mistranslation that was taken up in the Renaissance, and had an enduring global impact. I call this model the ―black but…‖ formulation, and it is to be found in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout written texts and reported speech, in historical as well as literary works. It was modeled grammatically and ideologically on the statement ―I am black but beautiful‖ often attributed to the Queen of Sheba in 1:5 of the―Song of Songs‖, and had a detrimental effect on how members of the early African forced diaspora were viewed by Renaissance Europeans. I argue that the newly adversarial nature of the phrase was adopted as a linguistic and cultural formulation, and introduced into Western European cultures a whole way of approaching and perceiving blackness or looking at black African people. [....] I examine what I am calling the ―black but…‖ formulation, which is to be found in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout written texts and reported speech, historical as well as literary works. It must have been modelled grammatically and ideologically on a statement often attributed to the Queen of Sheba in 1:5 of the Biblical book called the Song of Songs, the Song of Solomon or the Canticle of Canticles (also known by its Latin name as the Cantica Canticorum) in the Old Testament of the Bible.2 The Song of Songs is a collection of intense love lyrics between a man and a woman, resembling those found in ancient Egyptian collections. The propriety of including the Song of Songs in the Bible was questioned from the start (and there has been more fuss in the last century) but it has been accepted as canonical by both Jews and Christians. There have also been many different theories about how the Song of Songs should be interpreted: (continued in comments below...)

GABAPENTIN.  A visual meditation on the plethora of pharmacological devices to which most of us have easy access. In a society that denies the most basic medical care and even euthanasia, the enormous amount of pills, often unnecessary, that everyone can find at home, could easily provide a last option. #bigpharma #healthcare #pills #euthanasia

When everything else fails: EMBRACE YOUR MISTAKES ! I took a 4x5 Graflex for a stroll downtown today, wide angle lens, hand held. This was after months of not shooting anything in the street, by choice and necessity (I am still limping badly). So, I did - everything I could do - wrong. Out of a Graflex magazine of 6 negatives I managed to fog three, the other three, I double exposed twice or three times ( I lost count). Back in my darkroom, I threw the three surviving negatives, all together, in an overly hot developer soup, left them there and went to make myself a coffee.  An unspecified amount of time later, I pulled them from the developer, I under-fixed them, under-washed them and just chucked them on the kitchen window to dry. This is my favorite one of the lot.

Children seem to enjoy the experience, when I take their portrait: they always ask me questions about the huge wooden camera between us, they want to look in the ground glass, from under the focusing cloth and inevitably they want to give at least couple of squeezes to the rubber bulb that triggers the shutter (probably the most fascinating item to many of them). I photographed this smart young man in his mother 's kitchen, in Italy, only using natural light from a large window. We all had fun and both mother and son loved the print !!

Yesterday, on the day after the Presidential election, as I walked across town on my way to a medical appointment (my thanks to the existence of "Obamacare"), I noticed an eerie, unusual silence in the streets of New York. Then I saw someone with an umbrella walking in front of me. On the umbrella I saw a very American symbol, perhaps one of our most successful exports worldwide, aside chewing gum. I assume all Americans know the meaning of a raised middle finger, and so do most citizens of the world, by now. The real question is who or what do we raise our middle finger to. But I found no clear answers to my question. It felt as if that finger was mainly raised towards ourselves, towards our fellow Americans, towards all those frustrations, anger, injustices, we appear to have now decided to hate and despise, to angrily, violently fight against, not to debate anymore with decency, in search of solutions and civil compromises. Suddenly the rain felt much colder and a police siren broke the silence, just a few blocks away. #trump #darkages

As 2015 draws to an end, I can sum up my feelings with one word: gratitude. I feel grateful for many things: to simplify I 'll just say that I am grateful for one marvelous gift I am receiving everyday: TIME. Time to do what I love, to be with my loved ones, time to learn how to better use my time, time to think, time to listen, time to learn, time to expose a frame. In 2016 I wish you to be blessed with a better understanding of your inner time, and I exhort you to make the best of it, not based on someone else's definition of "best", not based on someone else's definition of "valuable", but simply listening to and trusting more your inner clock. Happy New Year !

You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may tread me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops. Weakened by my soulful cries. Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own back yard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise. by Maya Angelou

From last week photo shoot with wonderful Elektra. This was the very first shot of the portraiture sitting, on instant film, something I usually do to double check lighting setup and exposure. There are several other images I am happy with from my shoot with Elektra but the visual tension in this one probably makes it a big favorite. #aeroektar #1944lens #f2.5lens

From the series: people who inspire me. Who are they ? I hear you ask. Usually they are invisible people, humble artisans doing something in their own way and doing it very well. Usually they are not well known, they are not publicly celebrated, they don't get "likes" on their FB stream ( in fact they don't even have an internet connection), their "BS factor" is below zero.They are, as Musil used to say, "the heroes of the everyday"... Your watch stopped working ? Let me take a look at it..... There- it's working again- That'll be five dollars. Unfortunately this kind of people are a rapidly dying breed.

Straight out of my coffee- flavored darkroom,one of the first developed images, a lovely shot, in my opinion, from the latest portraiture sitting with model and actress extraordinaire @miszjez !! A real pleasure working with her ! Shot on 4x5 paper negative (3ASA), Tachihara camera, Fuji 250mm Soft Focus lens, developed in coffee. No Photoshop or retouching whatsoever was applied. Instead I achieved the soft look by using a portraiture lens (soft focus), an extremely low ASA rating (3), and a very careful illumination with roughly 2400 Watts per second strobe heads. The harsher is the  light on the subject, the softer the glow on the highlights, with this type of lens.

@house.of.windows One of those rare occasions when a portraiture sitting becomes a true meeting of minds and souls. 3 ASA paper negative, 8x10 Deardorff camera, Gundlach Manhattan Triple Convertible Lens. I am definitely looking forward to working together again !!!

At this time in my career I mostly shoot portraits. So it is not everyday that someone else take my portrait, especially using one of my "weapons of choice", in this case a 100 years old Cooke AVIAR lens on a large format camera. Last week, one of my favorite contemporary photographers, #vivianaperetti visited me in my studio and got to shoot my portrait. Lots of fun, enjoying Slow Photography with Viviana,  savoring each step of the process ! I took this snap of her while pulling the focusing cloth over her head to compose one of the portraits. I like it, Viviana looks like she is about to take off in flight!! And in fact, photographically speaking, she is already flying very high!! Check out her superlative work at vivianaperetti.com

No photoshop, no apps. no postproduction. How ? 3 ASA paper negative lit with a 75 watts bulb. Burke and James Rembrandt 4x5 . The lens was a broken reader magnifier I picked from the trash about 20 years ago in England and recently re-discovered at the bottom of an old suitcase. I attached it to the camera with gaffer tape. #lessismore is my mantra,

Photographs can lie. And sometimes they will. There is nothing tragic or abnormal or distressing about this image. This is a perfectly healthy girl who fell asleep on her mother's lap while visiting the Wall Street area in NYC. And yet it would be easy to convey a perception of human suffering in the viewer, depending on how we contextualize, or simply caption this picture. Just saying.....

I recently had the honor of photographing president Clinton. It wasn't the first time, as I was fortunate enough to photograph and record him in several other occasions during my career, but, as always, it was a real pleasure. Now, I am usually behind the camera, and it is part of my work ethic to never ask my subjects to pose next to me, but  this time it was Mr Clinton who suggested we take a photo together at the end of our session. Of course I was only too pleased to oblige, so I  handed my camera to a secret service officer who took a couple of shots of us. Mr Clinton remains one of my favorite American Presidents ( in my lifetime) and I do greatly miss the economic surplus we enjoyed during his presidency !

NO LIGHT NO PHOTOGRAPHY. And I think you'll find this statement particularly true the moment you put down your super duper high ISO digital camera and try to get an image focused on a 90 years old ground glass onto a piece of NEGATIVE printing paper rated 3ASA. Then again, whatever camera you use, light IS photography (or should I say photography IS light?) ! BTW never forget the shadows... they are photography too. Just as important as light !!

A little social networking experiment: I realized today that there are 5152 people following my work on Instagram. I was never on the gatekeepers "who to follow list", so it would appear that 5152 people are genuinely interested in the images I create. As some of them might know already I am an advocate for slow photography. My really big picture is really about practicing (again) a more organic, more focused, more humanly connected lifestyle in our age of fast web. So let's bring our conversation up a notch. I invite anyone who sees this message to write to me. Send me a postcard, a print of a photo of yours, a letter, some mail art you create… Or just a simple handwritten note. I promise I shall reply to you. My address is : P.O. BOX N, NY, NY, 10034, USA Giovanni Savino

I am back in town. I was in a place where beauty and tragedy often share the same space. Where I had no running water for two weeks. Where I had no electricity for two weeks. Where I had no phone or Internet for two weeks (actually I rather enjoyed that). Where I endured violent dust storms everyday, filling my camera, scratching my negatives, chocking my lungs, because it hadn’t rained in four months. Where I suffered a death in the family. Love and Photography pulled me through it all. I feel very grateful for that.
