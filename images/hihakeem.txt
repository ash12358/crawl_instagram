If your story doesn't move forward it most often has to do with either the protagonist's undefined goal or the fact that the plot isn't forcing him/her to take action. In other words, there are too few conflicts that force the protagonist to choose. Example: A man with a heart disease is promised a new heart. He is doomed to die very soon, will he not get a new heart soon. Suddenly there is the desired call. The surgeon is scheduling him for the next day. The man is very happy and celebrates a little too extravagant the night before. At night the surgeons' son has an accident. He was drunk driving and crashed him and a friend into a truck. The friend is dead and the son will be too, if he doesn't  get a new heart soon. Now the conflict is locked. The surgeon decides to give the heart to his son. The second act will be about playing out the conflict back and forth. It helps immensely to shape this overall conflict into a question. In this case it could be: Who is more deserving of the new heart? You present reasons why the son deserves the heart more and then you show why the other man is more deserving. The conflict has to culminate at a point where both, the son and the man are lying on the operating table at the same time. The one who gets the heart will survive, the other will die. Who will the surgeon choose? This needs to be the point of no return. A decision has to be made at this point, because the third act will all be about this decision and the consequences of it. #storyteller #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #screencraft #writersofinstagram #filmmaker #film #movie #authorsofinstagram #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

I cannot stretch this enough, be very very precise in choosing your protagonist. The journey will only matter if the lesson a character has to learn is related to inner need. If it isn‚Äôt then it will not be a satisfying experience for the reader/audience. Make sure that the protagonist‚Äôs scar matches the outer goal, or in other words the outer goal has to force the protagonist to deal with his/her scar. One other thing. Do not make the protagonist too nice. We like imperfect, flawed and struggling characters, that are forced to make descisions, but do not always make the right choices. You can also create an amoral character if you make sure that the motivation, the why, is clear from the get go. We as a reader do not need to approve of the action, but we need to understand the why. I often get scripts where the protagonist doesn‚Äôt change, doesn‚Äôt transform, but another supporting character does change a lot and therefore immediately becomes more compelling. Two reasons for this can be, that the writer did not choose the right protagonist for the story he/she wants to tell, or the journey isn‚Äôt forcing the protagonist to be active and to deal with his/her scar. Also you want to be looking at a redemption arc of the protagonist. Something where this characters needs to redeem him/herself from past sins. This will make the transformation even more compelling, because it gives the character an edge and and urge. A fun thing to also include is the fatal flaw. Something that always causes trouble for the protagonist, like for instance the character being a sex addict, but wanting to hold onto his/her true love. And last but not least, give your protagonist a skill. We like to watch people that are skillful. It also gives the character a sense of meaning and purpose. Whatever story you create you better make sure that the protagonist fits the story and that it becomes his/her journey, otherwise you will get the note that your script feels plot driven, because the motivation and the choices the protagonist makes, aren‚Äôt born from the character, but are forced onto him/her by the plot. #storyteller #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Taglines are single lines of dialogue, or sentences that a character uses as a kind of signature sentence that not only defines the character's attitude, maybe even his moral compass, but also can be used to state the theme in a movie. Example: One character comments on things that happen with this one tagline: "It is what it is." Now this tells us a lot about the character's world view and overall attitude towards life. But in the right context it becomes more than this: A woman is in love with a man. She has been her whole life. But she is to shy to admit it. The sad part is that the man is too but since she is to shy he thinks she is not interested. Then she has to move to a different place to work. He stays. When they meet for one last time, before she moves, she says: "It is what it is." But we know it must not be this way, if even they would talk to each other. So this becomes the thematic question: Is life predetermined? Are we victims of our fate? Fast forward to it 10 years in the future. Both of them are married, have children, but their marriages are sad indications of their wrongful choices. As fate has it they meet again and now they talk. They talk it all out, the love they feel, the bad decision they made, everything. And in the end, they go back to their families and she ends the conversation with: "It is what it is." #screenwriting #writing #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Ok you have written a script and finally got a meeting with some executives and/or producers. Celebrate, but then get to work. Meetings almost always end with you writing another draft. It's just the way it is. Any producer will want to make this project one he/she can believe in and more importantly invest in. This usually means there will be a lot of rewriting. I often get called to these meetings nowadays to 'translate' back and forth. Meaning I do try to explain to the writer what the producer thinks needs to be changed and tell the producer why it might not be a good idea based on what the writer wants. I always try to break a leg for the writers, but having had my own production company for a decade, I know what the concerns of producers are. It sure is a fragile business, but here's what I suggest you as a writer should start to think about: The decision to work with you is almost always solely based on whether the producer can imagine spending time with you as a person. Surprised? So it isn't about the writing? Yes, of course it is, that's what got you the meeting in the first place. But more importantly it's about your personality. With the list above, based on my experiences, having sat in those meetings, you should be able to leave a professional impression, which will be a game changer for you and your career. One last thing: Try to keep calm. It won't always be easy, I know. Not every producer has the ability to communicate that it‚Äôs not offending to us writers, but do yourself a favor and save your complaints for fellow writers and/or friends AFTER the meeting.

Let the villain have blind spots. Something the villain overlooks because he/she is too power hungry, too egocentric, too angry, too hateful, only concerned about his/her own interests. This is where the 'hero' can look for ways to defeat the villain. #Repost @dr.sharpwrite #screenwriting #amwriting #scriptwriter #writing

In a screenplay, there are two major forces at play: 1. action and 2. cause and effect. Action is the forward movement, that through a constant effort finally can lead to success. Cause and effect is the pattern which makes sure that there is a constant movement. Action has it‚Äôs origin in the character. It‚Äôs motivated by his/her decisions and actions, an action that provokes the next action, that constantly causes a new action to happen, based on the former. The trick now is to make sure you implement as many obstacles as possible. Take a bow and an arrow for example. The shooting of the arrow is the inciting incident, the one action that causes all the others. The goal is to hit the target. Now it‚Äôs your job to make sure the arrow doesn‚Äôt go in a straight line, bring in wind, an unexpected bush, that causes the arrow to loose speed and drop to the ground (cause and effect) The arrow needs to get picked up again‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what you want to achieve in a script. No straight line ever made a good story. Example: Jessy (16) shy to a degree it is painful to watch, a bike hiking extremist. One day, while on a hike, she crashes her bike. Along comes Mike on a motor bike and safes the day. This is the kick off to all the action to follow. Now it will be all about the goal of getting the boy. Every action she takes needs to be related to her character and every decision she makes needs to be rooted in her character as well. This means that her being shy causes a lot of trouble and obstacles for her. She might have been to shy to ask Mike about his number, but she managed to sneak a picture of him. She posts this to her Facebook wall and asks around if anyone knows Mike. His girlfriend replies to her. Oh ok, Mike has a girlfriend, that makes it worse, but now she starts to follow him on social media. He posts that he is going to karaoke night. Jessy is going too, but she is so very shy. Will she start to sing or not, can she win his heart over? See, how organically this story unfolds, based on action, cause and effect and obstacles you bring in? #sharingiscaring #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #storytelling

This applies to almost every feeling in your screenplay. The way humans are wired we are the most emotional if we understand the loss. Do not just show loss without gain. Only if we know and understand how happy goes, we can be pushed to extreme sadness. This is a method almost every romantic comedy uses. If the main plot is boy wants girl, then there  will be a part in the screenplay where boy gets girl, only to make us understand how great it feels and then destroy it moments later. Flashbacks have the most impact if they contradict or add to the present situation and create an understanding and an emotion that interacts with the present. Californication made this a center piece of his desire. By showing how happy they were, as a couple, we understand his inner struggle and we share the thrill with him to want to be together again. BUT beware! Before you dive into a flashbacks make sure you‚Äôve introduced the hero first. Connect us to the hero and then make him more complex by adding layers to him/her. For example: Meet Jenny (40). We see her buying birthday gifts. The way she treats everyone at the shops makes us like her. She‚Äôs nice, others talk nice about her, at work everyone wants to works with her because she is so skilled in creating gardens. BUT she seems to be lonely and extremely scared of loud noises, especially those that sound like gun shots. Taking a closer look we realize how tense she is. Her eyes are always on the move, she biting her nails, constantly faking her smile. At night we see her sitting in a very sparse apartment kitchen, gifts on the table and a small cake with a candle on it. On the cake it says. Happy Birthday Patrick. While unwrapping the gifts, start the flashback. Start with the same cake. Patrick smiles at Jenny, blows out the candles and kisses her. They seem happy. Then he excuses himself and leaves for the bathroom. She puts all the gifts on the table and waits for him when she hears a gun shot. End the flashback and get back to the present and show her throwing around the gifts in the kitchen crying. #sharingiscaring #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writers #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

When creating a hero you want to pay close attention to the hero‚Äôs past. View his/her past as a wound that hasn‚Äôt healed yet, but could rip open any second now. Make it personal. It can be a flaw, a secret or a habit that causes great trouble in the present and raises the stakes for the hero. This wound needs to be closed for good, before he/she can heal to become their true selves. This is best shown as a kind of lesson the hero has to learn to evolve beyond his/her history. Meet Mike (21) he‚Äôs in a wheelchair, because he saved his younger brother from getting hit by a car and sort of took the hit for him. Mike‚Äôs life is bleak, his major flaw is that he uses his disability to be a jerk to anyone surrounding him, he has a record for mentally abusing others, especially his younger brother. One day he receives a call that his younger brother is in hospital. Cancer. He needs a bone marrow donor. Mike is the only one who can donate, but he refuses to do so. He still blames his brother for his bleak existence and wants to see him suffer too. His brother is married to a beautiful wife and just had a little daughter. His sister in law begs to help his brother, but Mike refuses and instead takes off. Now, his journey has to be all about the lesson Mike has to learn, which is: He needs to come to peace with his decision to safe his brother in the past and he has to accept his fate and start seeing that he is still alive and that being a live is a true blessing. Let Mike run away, ride the wheelchair down the dark streets at night, totally wasted, until he causes an accident. The driver of the car is badly injured but Mike manages to save her. Mike then stops by the hospital everyday to make up for the damage he caused. At first, she doesn‚Äôt want to see him, but he‚Äôs persistent and while getting to know her better, he learns his lesson(s) and finally apologizes to his brother, donates his bone marrow and falls in love with the girl who is slowly recovering from the accident. Or, if you hate happy endings, let Mike die donating. #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writersofinstagram #write #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Understanding the characters actions is not only crucial to the writer, it is important for the reader too. Only if the thoughts that lead to intentions and then to actions are clear, will the reader be emotionally involved in the plot that leads to the transformation of that character.  In other words, what a character does, his/her actions define their character. Based upon their moral compass, forced into intense situations, where they have to make a choice, they will make decisions that reveal their character and therefore their moral quality. So character equals moral quality. For example: If a woman doesn‚Äôt believe in marriage but marries a man to help him get a green card, but does so because of the money he‚Äôs willing to pay her, it reveals a lot about her moral qualities. Included in this example is also a possible transformation, from a greedy materialist to maybe a loving ascetic having found a new path in life. The intentions of the characters are what makes a reader care. Another example: Stealing a car for the sake of driving around in a Lamborghini, does make you a whole other person, than stealing a Lamborghini to race more quickly to the next hospital to safe a dangerously injured child. You don‚Äôt always have to highlight the hero though process beforehand to make the reader understand, but it is important that while the character is doing what he‚Äôs doing it becomes clear why he/she does it the way he/she does it. Knowing this gives you some great tools at hand such as creating anticipations that lead in a different direction and might even make the hero look bad ,but then you reverse the readers notion by revealing the hero‚Äôs thoughts/intentions and the whole scenario can be seen in a different light. Just keep in mind: Action reveals character, but the without understanding the intentions we cannot be emotionally involved. #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writersofinstagram #write #screenwriter #script #storytelling #words #filmmaker #film #movie #writingadvice #ebook #freeebook #book #motivation #inspiration #dailytips #goals #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Turn around your hero‚Äôs luck to amp up the emotional drama in your script. Especially if you reverse the hero‚Äôs good luck, this will not fail to create lots of emotional tension in the reader. Most likely at a point in the script, where the hero has already been through hell and is just recovering, has somewhat learned his lesson and made a decision to change his/her life and then hit him/her hard by reversing his/her fortune and turning into the next disaster. Remember, creating emotions is raising and lowering the hero‚Äôs fate. Therefore the reversal of his/her luck is the building block to achieving this in your screenplay. The beauty of it is, the hero can directly cause this reversal by his/her actions, or it can be indirectly, forced upon him/her from the outside world, maybe as a result of his former actions. You‚Äôve all heard of karma, right? This is where Karma comes into play. For example: John (65), a retired warden just bought a boat to go fishing to savor his pension.  While working in prison he made a lot of enemies, because of his brutal punishments of inmates who weren‚Äôt always justified. Divorced three times, his life has been lonely and hard. But he had an epiphany when his only son had a child and he became a grandpa. His grandchild teaches him valuable lessons about life, respect for other human beings and a great lesson about punishment. John‚Äôs epiphany leads to him trying to be a better person. He‚Äôs contacting all his ex-wifes, apologizing for what an asshole he has been. Then one day his new mind set gets tested by his grandchild. The kid ruined his boat, but instead of taking it out on him he keeps calm, recaptures his dignity. Now he has to get the boat to the repair shop. At the repair shop works a son of a former inmate and he recognizes the warden from stories his father told him. The warden was responsible for his father dying in prison. A couple of days later, the warden picks up the boat and goes on a little fishing trip. Half way into the bay the boat explodes and kills the warden. #sharingiscaring #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writersofinstagram #write #screenwriter #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Often the subplots deal with elements of your story that highlight your theme. They make the theme visible. Whereas plot is where the action takes place. Subplots are connected to the wish, the inner goal of your hero and plot is your hero‚Äôs desire, the outer goal. Which means they are connected. A subplot that works best is one that is interwoven with the plot. Meaning, at some point, usually at the end of act two, subplot and plot intertwine. Subplots are also a great way to get deeper in terms of character. It‚Äôs the place where you can show how much the hero has changed, or how vulnerable he/she really is. But whatever way you choose it to be, make sure it‚Äôs connect through the theme of your movie. Example: If your main plot is about a love story between a gay couple (Rick 'n Pat) and your theme is identity, then a probable subplot set up could look like this: Rick‚Äôs desire is getting Pat. Rick‚Äôs inner conflict could be to accept himself. This would mean that your main plot is about Rick getting together with Pat and overcoming all the obstacles that make it nearly impossible from them to be together. The subplot could be something like Rick hiding his true sexual preferences at work and therefore denying his identity. You could even add more punch to it, if you‚Äôd put Rick in an environment where it‚Äôs all about being a macho man, e.g. make him a Rap artist. The subplot deals with the theme and makes it visible, as well as the hero‚Äôs inner conflict and takes the plot a notch further by giving the main plot more substance and also by raising the stakes. For eg. if other Rappers would threaten Rick‚Äôs life because he is gay. #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writersofinstagram #write #screenwriter #script #storytelling #words #filmmaker #film #movie #writingadvice #Repost @dr.sharpwrite

Cut your exposition, now! The start of your script is the most arbitrative. Let‚Äôs be honest. When you pick up a new book in the store, often, after you've read the cover text, you‚Äôll be reading the first few pages. Why? Because if the story doesn‚Äôt draw you in, you won‚Äôt feel the need to spend your money on it. Same goes for screenplays. You need to make sure that the first two pages shine so bright that no producer, executive etc. can and will put your script down. Often writers get carried away with exposition. Most of the times when my students hand in their screenplays, it‚Äôs the part that lacks the most. Before you give your script to anyone, make sure you only included the most crucial aspects in your exposition and then cut right to the chase. (not to be taken only literally!)But what do you need to include: 1. An opening image that says it all. Tone, Voice and theme. 2. Genre. Make no mistake, genre is the most underrated aspects writers pay attention to, but it‚Äôs the one that will sell your script. 3. A hook. A hook can be: A question, a dilemma, a feeling, a sound, an exclamation, a complaint. 4. Introduce your hero (in action!!!) 5. Establish the context of your story: Where, when, who, what?  6. Give a sense of the vastness of your story. Is it going to be a one set piece or an epic battle drama? If you need to explain how a world works, because its different to the one we know, do this in a way that is entertaining. Don‚Äôt make people read, don‚Äôt use voice over. Webb in your information on how the world works by using your hero and letting him explore the world and by that introduce not only him/her but also the rules of this world. Have a great writing weekend. #screenplay #screenwriting #writing #writer #amwriting #creativewriting #writersofinstagram #write #screenwriter #script #storytelling #words #filmmaker #film #movie #writingadvice repost by @dr.sharpwrite

Procrastination is the death of every transformation. No matter what you call it; Lack of time, exhaustion, writer‚Äôs block, self doubt, fear .. it doesn‚Äôt matter, they are all based on the same mindset: I write when I‚Äôm ready. Guess what, you will never feel fully ready. Having an idea is exciting, but shaping this idea into a story is painful and exhausting, but it‚Äôs what separates the pros from the amateurs. It‚Äôs not all about talent and creativity, it‚Äôs more about will power and discipline. Writers need to have self discipline. Writers need to be able to motivate themselves to sit down and do the work, have the discipline to stay focused for hours and have the courage to go back and rewrite every single word. This is a mindset that you as a writer need to establish to succeed. No one else can do this for you. This is the hard part. All this motivation out there falls flat, if you don‚Äôt put in the work. Write. Write now. Here're some tips that help me get to work: 1. Turn everything off. Yes, even Instagram ;) Distraction is the food procrastination lives on. 2. Set a time slot. Sit down in your chair in front of whatever you write on and don‚Äôt move away. Stay put. Even if you just stare on the blank screen, don‚Äôt move. After a while writing will feel like the only option, that‚Äôs when you‚Äôre in the right mindset. 3. Give yourself deadlines. Have a goal. Remember, your hero needs to have a goal, right? Without it the story lacks momentum. It‚Äôs the same with your writing. 4. Talk about your work. Often ideas start to flow when I‚Äôm talking about what I‚Äôm working on at the moment with either fellow writers, or friends, or even family. Every time you talk about your writing the story will evolve. Your get a better picture of what you want to tell. 5. Listen. Yeah you heard right. We live in a world where there‚Äôs a lot of talking, but no one actually listens. You as a writer should listen carefully to what‚Äôs around you. You‚Äôll be amazed of how much you learn and how much your writing will improve. Not to mention the source of inspiration that listening holds.

Every writer knows the struggle. Sitting your butt down in a chair, putting words on the page, can come easy, but too often it‚Äôs just a drag. Writing is hard, no doubt. Considering all the emotional turmoil that comes with being honest to yourself and your readers, the nagging self doubt, the constant struggle to find words and the brutal truth of reading what you wrote yesterday. All of this is daily business for us writers. It comes with the territory so to speak. But what can be done about it? I myself do two things. First, if self doubt strikes I remind myself that there was a spark that set the whole effort of writing in motion. Self doubt just means I have lost that spark. So I need to find it again. What helps is asking why do I want to tell the story, what matters to me? Stop reading other writers,stop watching great TV Shows or movies, concentrate on just your story, nothing else. The reason why you are drowning in self doubt is probably that you lost connection to your story. Try rewriting aspects of your work and by that find a new approach and with that confidence. Which brings me to the second thing I do. I seek confidence. We writers are fragile individuals we need a pat on the back from time to time, someone that tells us that it‚Äôs worth the effort, that we are no fraud, no fake, that we are the real deal. Go out, surround yourself with friends who take you the way you are. Build up your confidence by talking about your work, find out what sticks when telling your story. Go home and concentrate on these moments. Write from there. And last but not least, the one thing that helps me the most is: Taking the time to suck in what‚Äôs happing around me. Most of the time I get stuck with my story is because I ran out of inspiration. Observe people, read the newspaper, watch documentaries that deal with your theme, go out take a walk, let the sun lead you the way. Walking and looking around you does magic. Writers tend to "only‚Äú exist in their heads, it‚Äôs ok to step out of your self imagined prison from time to time and experience some peace of mind, by just being for a moment. Hit the breaks, before it breaks you. #screenwriting #scriptwriting #writer

Let your hero make good and bad decisions. No one is purely either good or bad. It‚Äôs the variety of bad and good decisions that form a complex hero. It doesn't matter if it's the hero of the story or the villain. If they only serve the purpose of a protagonist and an antagonist, your story will feel flat and your characters won't  feel vivid. Keep in mind that people can change their minds and change their attitudes, but they will only do so, if they are forced to think about their actions. It's your job as a storyteller to create those conflicts where the characters are forced to make decisions. Now broaden your variety of conflicts by letting your characters break out of their stereotypical behaviors, like the hero only making good decisions and the villain therefore only bad ones. But there's one trap. You need to let your characters make those decision based on his/her principles and believes. If you don't it'll come across as made up, because it doesn't fit naturally into the realm of the characters motivations.

Top 10 Secrets to Writing #screenwriting #screenwriter #scriptwriting #filmmaking
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c36813df649036a9b6a05f71ee180dff/5BDD11EF/t51.2885-15/e35/12724753_1676537595951998_1570403882_n.jpg
Bring in a visual element that the hero and villain fight over, that reflects their conflict based on the theme. For instance, if you have two parties, one lead by the hero, the other by the villain, but both are fighting for the same thing, to survive in a hostile environment, make the theme question about s.th. like: Is survival of the fittest really what guarantees the future of mankind, or are there other human virtues at play, as well? Now make the struggle real, by choosing a setting that is primal and forces each side to act or die. Take a bottle of water, for instance. Pretty trivial, right? But if you embed the struggle in a hostile environment, where water is the most valuable good, the stakes are pretty high and it suddenly it makes perfect sense to fight over it. By having this simple visual element that projects the theme, the struggle and of course the desire, you set what‚Äôs called a visual anchor to help convey the message of your movie and built suspense.  Depending on what your message is going to be, you need to tweak the outcome to what fits your needs, and again be visual in doing so. Example: First let the hero find the bottle, but the villain takes it away, before the hero could drink from it, because the hero is too full of himself and therefore acts sloppy.  The hero chases after the villain, reclaims it before the villain could drink from it, because the villain is so blind from hate that he is easily tricked by the hero, but in the end the bottle just smashes to the ground and neither of them gets to drink the water. Proverbs are a good reference here. Like, where two are fighting, the third wins. Then of course you would bring in a third one, like a little smart kid,  who takes off with the water and drinks it, while the hero and the villain are still busy fighting. #screenplay #screenwriting #screenwriter #storytellers #film #filmmaker #filmmaking #writing #creativewriting #writer #writersofinstagram #words #teaching #amwriting #creativewriting #writingadvice
