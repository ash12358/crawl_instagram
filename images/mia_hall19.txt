This last month has been a great one. I always smile big but this one is even huge for me. I relish in the wisdom of intelligent women and men following and living their dreams. . . . Had a great time hosting @thephiltaittshow’s #dreamreachinspire event, but an amazing time hearing the stories, lessons learned, insights and advice from @misahylton and @erickampittman. My biggest takeaway was how much all three features value giving back to the community. I’m thoroughly convinced that giving back to help others fulfill their dreams is a large part of people making their own a reality.

Love the fact that @cherylwills_ny1 truly practices what she teaches. I have now seen her on three different occasions, directly serving the community she often reports on and seeks to develop, especially young Black Kings and Queens. Our stories are important and Cheryl is working hard to make sure they are being told to millions in New York City and beyond through her reporting, hosting, books, keynotes and more. Thank you for being an active inspiration to all! #keepelevating #mhbastorytellers

I realize the sad news wont stop, so neither will I.

**Empowered women empower women** *********** One of the main reasons I have such a great passion for training young women to thrive from the inside out is because of the awesome women God put in my life to do the same for me. Have felt nothing but gracious energy since the first time I met Ashley and have received so much care from before I stepped on campus until today. Thank you for leading me to my home by the sea and all you do to improve the education of thousands of students and your own young queen. Much love to you always @akp1913 💙💙🤗😘

In 2012, the United Nations declared October 11th as "International Day of the Girl Child" to help galvanize worldwide enthusiasm for the betterment of the lives of young girls and to provide opportunities for them to show leadership and reach their full potential.

**Trying times brings out the greatness in people** We've seen some wild times recently and at the same time, we see people speaking out, standing up, living in their truth, supporting each other and coming together in great numbers. We all have a role to play and it's not by any means the same. Know you are appreciated for anything you do for the end goal of liberation, celebration, and support of your neighbors near and far. _________ NYC!

New week, new goals, who's stopping you? __________ Had the great opp to speak with @lenawaithe about a challenge that actually turned out to be an opportunity in disguise that helped her continue to work and write and eventually catapult her way into Hollywood history. Congratulations Lena, @childishgambino and all of those who are able to tell the story of African Americans from a first person perspective - diversifying and reconstructing the Black narrative one story at a time.

Rooted. Grounded.🌳 -- My trip back to 'The Boot' was a memorable one, not just because of the time I had at #nabj17 but also being able to visit my paternal grandparents' home state and my first memorialized plantation (as I went to school on a former one) The Whitney Plantation. Will share my blog on my YouTube page as the experience was one for the books. It's one thing to see slave quarters on TV and in museums but another to walk in one on the original land where slaves once were. -- Thankful to my ancestors for somehow surviving and making it possible for my family to live today. Sad that the struggle continues but will always celebrate those before us without whom the liberties we do have wouldn't be possible without.

Since @adena_jones has known me and knew my desires to go deeper into media, she's been telling me about the @nabjofficial convention. Excuses were made for likely 5 years until thankfully I was sponsored by my job to attend in 2016. Of course I was blown away by the amount of community, resources and content offered in one week for Black people that wanted to use their voice to report news and more. Sad it took me so long, but am happy to have made it to my 2nd convention as it's always a time to remember. Appreciate you always AJ!

King said a lot of great things, but more importantly followed his words with actions.

Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay — the day black women’s pay finally catches up to white men’s pay from last year 😞 (via @splcenter) Looking forward to continuing to prep young women for college and careers, but not without encouraging them to fight and negotiate for what they are owed. -- Quick tips: 'As woman of color we should always be prepared! First research, research, research! ...One tool we recommend during our career boot camps for women of color at The Memo is Get Raised. This online tool helps women research their market value and generates a letter one can give to their manager. Additionally, document your wins throughout the year, this is a good time to remind your employer that you are a great asset to the companies bottom line. You are your best advocate!' @myweeklymemo Founder @mindaharts via @nbcblk #keepelevating! #girlpower 👑💖💁🏾 📷: @jswiftphotos

Gabi is a master connecter and not only connected me to Lina, after I met her online through @heragenda, but also helped me gain a new client which I look forward to working with in the next few weeks. *** Lina told me about this @oneyoungworld event at @facebook and shared a story this week with a networking tip I try to practice, and was able to, at the session: 'When asking a question, introduce yourself. Let people know what you offer, you never know who in the room may need you.' *** Had a great time reconnecting with @theshantaej @cavaughn and @tperez_4prez and meeting @kels_cw and @jeromejarre *** Check out @oneyoungworld if you're interested in meeting people and getting inspiration to making changes in the world.

Remember #womentowatch19 Wednesdays? May have to bring it back🤔 or at least updates😁 For instance, little over a year ago I posted about @iamjazaugust (below) fast forward to today she won Rookie of the Year for her department at the @nba.

**One Love ❤️💚💛🖤** *** Great times celebrating #Chadena with some amazing people this weekend! I learned a lot from @aandrews00 over the years and this weekend learned even more keys: 1) when you give love you get love - over 50 people came from across the country to celebrate she and @sneaker_galactus because of what they give to the world 2) Greats roll with the greats - you are the average of the five people you hang with the most so I'm not surprised at the dope, caring, brilliant, loving family and friends of Chad and Adena I met this weekend. 🎹KEA's: Keep elevating always🚀

'Don't nitpick at your dreams' - @kelawalker ✨✨✨✨✨ Booked: When I wanted to pursue reporting more seriously, Kéla allowed me to 'book' a Meetup with her to learn more about how she got into her career. Busy: With her advice, I got to work with more confidence, competence, and thanks to her blog, class. Blessed: not only did I win a chance to have my Kloset transformed with #kelavie's expertise, I've continued to learn from her as she elevates and doesn't shy away from sharing advice on the way. Hope you had an amazing birthday and may this upcoming year be your most #bookedbusyblessed yet 💖

Got transparent in my newsletter today and am beyond thankful for @wendy_wins and @thekatrinaclayton who always put eyes on it before I send it out, and Tyelise, founder of @iadonia, who shared her feedback on this quarter's letter on IG. I am definitely inspired to keep going and continue to encourage anyone reading this to keep pushing as you never know who you're impacting. You can subscribe at the link in my bio. Love you Ty! #Repost @iadonia ・・・ I'm sitting in my car with thoughts in my head debating what to post on my personal IG. God knows my heart & what I WANT to say. But He's been working on me & my lashing tongue lately, so I can't say it. 😳 lolol. Instead I stopped pondering, open my email & see the latest Mia's Full Court Press newsletter from my little sister @mia_hall19 & felt instant gratification. She writes "Sometimes you make mistakes but you have to own up to them, get up and keep going, harder.....I encourage you to remember 'to whom much is given, much is required' and stay encouraged through the process of moving from aspirations to manifestations." Thank you Mia. You dropped those jewels Girl!! 😘 I love what I do. But every so often I want to stop, scream &/or occasionally choke someone out (Sorry Baby Jesus, 👼🏽I'm just being real 😌). 17 years in the game, & this entrepreneurship thing can STILL work my nerves. But the job was given to me by God & requires lots of patience, faith & owning up to the mistakes I make. Then Going even harder & not letting it happen again. If you don't follow my girl, please do so ASAP. Then subscribe to her website www.miahall19.com and her YouTube Channel (Mia's Full Court Press). Every now and then she'll drop a serious #jewel 💎 in addition to her numerous interviews with the best in Sports and Entertainment.  #iadonia #marketing #pr #sports #eventplanner #changes #mistakes #Godis #bosslady #miasfullcourtpress #miahall #entrepreneurs #gottafocus

Before launching my site, sharing my business cards and building relationships in was great, though I am happy I made the investment in a website to grow my business further than ever.

🗝Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it 🗝Nelson Mandela David did in one day what the people of Israel couldn't do in a month and a half?! Small group last night and devotions this morning has my mind going - thankful for my iron sharpeners for your words that pierce, challenge, and encourage me along this journey @ashleyblkwood @seshmi and @msdrysdale 🙏🏾 #accountabilityworks #coworldchangers #community

Learning more about revolutionary women through art by revolutionary women with a revolutionary woman (and man:) was pretty...awesome😁 Loving @iamaprilwalker's new #walkergemsbook - very practical takeaways that I am using even now. Make sure you visit @walkerwear dotcom and check it out! #readysetgrow #walkergems

🎼🎤...Brooklyn keep on takin' it🎤🎼 Brooklyn is a very different place than I remember it being growing up or even five years ago, nonetheless, so is the digital space 👨🏾‍💻👩🏼‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻. ➡️@Google tapped Brooklyn born and bred  @linadarrisaw as their coach to help businesses level up throughout the city and she's prepped to help develop businesses owned by women, people of color, residents of New York City Housing, etc. to get access to, disrupt, and occupy more spaces in tech and beyond. Was happy to share this experience w more born and bred Brooklynites: mogul-in-the-making @mzgrant and the founder of one of my favorite women's empowerment empires @neshasagenda. 💖 Can't speak about google w/o saluting the awesome work Head of Black Community Engagement @valeisha is doing to change the face of tech and increase access across the board! 👸🏾 #itsgoingdown #basement

✨Focus on the journey, not just the destination✨ I first heard these words from @therealarbernard. They get me through many a long, uneventful days and the 'in-between times' Minister @gabbycwilkes speaks about. When I started 'Mia's Full Court Press' four years ago, I was happy to help my friends navigate their next career step and my mentees along their journey to life after college. Today, I enjoy creating creative content online and visiting different colleges and organizations, empowering people to break out of their comfort zones and into their dream careers. I am thankful for the way technology gives me the freedom to be bold and follow my small business passions on a larger scale. Being able to connect with existing and potential clients, working with interns, and building my database is much simpler now than ever before🙏🏾 💻Check out the link in my bio to see how awesome women across the country are brazenly navigating their industries as entrepreneurs! @intel #SHEOWNSIT #Sponsored #smallbiz

*Ask and you shall receive...' ~Matt 7:7 When I texted my friends my prayer for 4 @washwizards playoff tickets, I had no idea I'd get an answer to my prayers a few days later. Always great to see my big, @lives2inspire and my Pirate @kris10miles in her hometown. Thankful to the @atlhawks for their awesome hospitality and a great first experience at #phillipsArena. Though the Hawks lost the series, they've won a special place in my heart 😁
