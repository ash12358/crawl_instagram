Loot from #cafkl. Finally got my hands on komik ronyok by @azwanjjai and the second book of Taubat Si Tanggang, of which I raged a little about the different size from the first book. Fat cat stickers and bookmark from @bulatcat_house, botanical stickers from @cloveraureate, create stickers from @azreenchan, gemstone and cat faces from a booth at the end, near where the line forms for signings. If anyone knows who this last one was, please let me know. @andrealism, @thestrangefroot and I bought different gem colours and swapped them around. There‚Äôs tons of cool stuff but didn‚Äôt buy prints or postcards because I don‚Äôt have any space to display them.

Is this a great photo or is this a great photo? Team Nasi Lemak (-1) outside the Mauerpark flea market after we acquired our loot on Sunday morning. Despite the persistent drizzle, we had a good muck around, buying old things and new things. The flea market is comprehensive enough to have items ripe for thrifting and local artists hawking their wares. They even sell furniture and kitchenware, y‚Äôall! On that note, I‚Äôm gonna miss exploring Berlin with this lot and all the new friends I made this trip. üì∑ by @hamztravels. #BallinInBerlin #flyscoot #visitberlin #berlin365 #berlincity #scoot2berlin #mauerpark #mauerparkflohmarkt #fleamarket

Yesterday‚Äôs cool discovery: this man covering one of Berlin‚Äôs beautiful manhole covers with paint, and then taking a print of it with a large sheet of brown or black paper. I especially love the dramatic contrast of colours on the black paper but unfortunately ended up not buying one because I can‚Äôt pack it in my luggage and I don‚Äôt want to hand carry a fragile roll of paper from here to Kuching. What a great souvenir that would have been! If you‚Äôre interested, you can find him at Hackescher Markt in the afternoon. He told me that he‚Äôs there every day for about 3 hours, weather permitting. We found him at about 4.30pm on Sunday. Each print will set you back at about ‚Ç¨5. And oh, have a way to carry a meter-long tube of paper back to where you came from. #BallinInBerlin #flyscoot #visitberlin #berlin365 #berlincity #scoot2berlin #streetartist #manholecover #manholecoverprint

Intermission at The One Grand Show and I am so thrilled and grateful to @flyscoot and @visit_berlin for this opportunity to watch a stage theatre musical show after a long break. This is a crazy ass costume extravaganza with costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, featuring some dance and acrobatics. The stage is insanely versatile; just before intermission, it ‚Äúcracked‚Äù open into chunks like icebergs, with light and smoke pouring out of them. Intermission over.

Visiting the Denkmal f√ºr die ermordeten Juden Europas, or Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. There are 2,711 concrete slabs or "stelae", arranged in a grid pattern on a sloping field. Some are low, and some loom overhead. It was a slightly unsettling experience, walking through a labyrinth with no dead ends, although if you want out, you can keep walking until you run out of rows and columns. It‚Äôs easy to lose a friend here; the moment one of us stepped sideways or turn a corner, it‚Äôs hard to find each other again. There‚Äôs probably some cool metaphor in there somewhere but I‚Äôll leave that for a future poem. Here I am with Keng Yap and Isaac, my young gents from Singapore, who were both good at directions and art direction. I really want to come back here to shoot a poetry video. #scoot2berlin #memorialforthemurderedjewsofeurope #BallinInBerlin #flyscoot #visitberlin #berlin365 #berlincity

Sanssouci Palace. Fredrick the Great‚Äôs modest 12-room summer place. Strictly pleasure only - wine, music, poetry, books, entertaining. He lived here with his dogs and was eventually buried in the garden with his dogs. It was a self-guided audio tour, meaning I can take my time to examine the rooms and take photos. This is the ceiling of the palace‚Äôs reception - columns, cherubs, er .... headless armless golden torsos. If you can‚Äôt be here in person, Google Arts & Culture has a streetview of the palace‚Äôs interiors but alas, no guided tour. I think this was genuinely a happy place. None of the spiritual heaviness of the Berlin Wall, just a disarming emotional blank slate, generously slathered in gold and marble, and drowned in wine. #scoot2berlin #explorepotsdam #sanssouci

Surprisingly, most in attendance do not currently use a bujo. I also did not know most of them which is cool coz I thought half the room was gonna be friends who came to give me face. Hope people learned something. Maybe a more detailed report tomorrow. I‚Äôm all talked out. First pic is by @peggyzoewong. Second one by me when I found the poster downstairs. Thank you @icubeinno and @malcolm_bocao for this opportunity.

Something about the road to Serian makes me borderline narcoleptic. Fortunately I‚Äôm not driving today so I took a nap in the back seat.

Prepping for tomorrow. Got two finished copy of the poem I‚Äôm handwriting to raise funds for @neynaprada ‚Äòs bills hanging up to dry completely before I pack and ship. One more order to process.

Drill, drill, drill. This piece is coming closer to how I want to lay it out but each page is practice unless it is perfect.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fix ugly.‚Äù Sure you can. The outside is easy enough to fix with some carefully applied make-up, or in this case, a light touch of post-processing. The inside, however, is usually a bigger problem, something beyond the capabilities of a beauty app. You can‚Äôt select ‚Äògratitude‚Äô or ‚Äòaltruism‚Äô and pull the slider up to maximum. You can‚Äôt select ‚Äòempathy‚Äô or ‚Äòlove‚Äô and slide it high enough not to be a sociopath yet low enough so you can still function. You can‚Äôt contour your expectations or slim down your insecurities. Or maybe you can. It‚Äôll take time. It‚Äôll take work. It‚Äôll take your willingness to bare it all and say, ‚ÄúThis is me, staying true and taking care of myself, so I can give the universe better than I got.‚Äù #selfcare #sacredbitch

After work this evening, I felt compelled to drop by mph. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was looking for but I knew when I spotted it - the lone copy of Taboo by @melizarani. I‚Äôve been meaning to get a copy but couldn‚Äôt find it until now. Meliza brought limited copies back in October, but they quickly sold out.  I read @szelyn ‚Äòs copy last year and am delighted to finally own a copy. While I was there, I also picked up the Malay version of Felicia Yap‚Äôs Yesterday. I want to improve my Malay and also *cough* this version is a third or a quarter the price of the English one.

This week‚Äôs #minutemondays poetry video features ... ME! Pop over to @wordsmithsofkuching to view. ‚Ä¢ I wrote this inspired by something I said to a friend recently, so it has no relation at all to the story I‚Äôm about to tell you. ‚Ä¢ My friend @neynaprada is in the hospital with serious lung and kidney infection. Its turning out to be a large medical bill because she‚Äôs in a private hospital. Neyna lives her life being true to herself, which is something a lot of us struggle with, and something that is extremely courageous for her. She lights the room up when she walks in, probably because she lights us on fire, yo. ‚Ä¢ Anyway, we don‚Äôt want Neyna and her family to face this huge bill alone. I will be selling a very limited number of individually written copies of this very poem to help raise some funds. The piece is A4 with room to frame. Each piece will look a little different because I‚Äôm not a photocopy machine. Interested? DM me for details. If you prefer to donate directly to Neyna‚Äôs funds, head to my profile for the link to our fundraiser. ‚Ä¢ #wordsmithsofkuching #calligraphyaf #teamneyna #fundraising #wok #wordofmouthkch

Editing the February poem. You‚Äôve seen a snippet of it a few posts back. The editing process is both exhilarating and exhausting, a period swinging between ‚Äúnearly there‚Äù and ‚Äúlol nope‚Äù. A learning process, as always.

I‚Äôm glad I got to see some friends today. I was still on leave and didn‚Äôt want to vegetate at home. But I was also feeling a bit down and snappy. Been a bit like that since the new moon. People around us also seemed to be off-balanced today - mostly knocking stuff over or tripping on something. I nearly walked into a waitress myself. This week‚Äôs bujo layout, which I didn‚Äôt get around to doing until tonight, reflects my mood. I‚Äôm in bed already since staying up to layan my ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù mood isn‚Äôt really helping anyone.

Getting my soul ready for @markzdanielewski ‚Äòs #houseofleaves book club end of this month. I‚Äôve been obsessed with this album since I stumbled upon it and found that it‚Äôs a companion album to a weird book called House of Leaves and @officialpoe is MZD‚Äôs sister. Their respective work was based on their childhood and their father. It took me years to find a copy of the book, but it‚Äôs been sitting on my shelf for just as long after I got a copy some years ago. Hoping this will finally kicked me off into reading.

This poem calligraphy piece was in the pipes for a couple of weeks, as some of you might have noticed in my feed, and finally went to its intended owner tonight. The Xmas gift exchange was a lucky draw but the luck of the draw seemed to have matched the gift of words with all the right people although we didn‚Äôt know who would end up with it. Good end to the year!  #georgettetan #calligraphyaf

A packing list for January. I posted a plainer version of this on my Facebook earlier but since I‚Äôve acquired my new Koi brush pen, I‚Äôve been jazzing things up here and there.

I don‚Äôt give gifts, but when I do...

Picked up some lavender essential oil this evening. Tonight‚Äôs blend is lavender and bergamot instead of my usual eucalyptus. Wish me a good night!

Affirmation comes in unexpected ways. I was just thinking about how I fell so short of my reading goals this year (19/50 books) and that I need to work my way through my unread library next year. Then a lovely friend shows up at my doorstep with this beautiful leather page corner bookmark as a gift. I wasn‚Äôt even looking for a sign but it came. Thanks, friend. You know who you are.

I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs looking for. She came here and stared so intently into the drain this morning and evening that I ended up poking the foliage a few times to make sure there wasn‚Äôt a kitten or puppy hiding in there.

I really like this moon phases washi tape but would apply a lighter hand the next time! I‚Äôm drawn to using it because the full moon is this week. The habit tracker is for a few simple things that I‚Äôve been failing at this year. This page is sponsored by @mrronnieteo (I didn‚Äôt finish that roll of tape).

When your colleague have a washi tape stash and you raided for variety. I should have taken a photo of the washi tape rack!

The fact that my last day at this house is on a full moon is very interesting. Very cun, if you know what I mean. I plan on dedicating January to packing up this house and moving bits and pieces over to my parents‚Äô new place.

If you think my 2018 bullet journal is pretty well laid out, you have to understand that behind that is hours of surfing through Instagram looking at bujo porn for inspiration. I‚Äôm enjoying this layout for my minimalist monthly page. I‚Äôll probably jazz it up later down the line. Swipe for my current December spread.
