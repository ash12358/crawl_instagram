Dekada Nobenta... With Fritzy (a Japanese Spitz pup gift from my ex-gf) and my first car (a 4-door VW Brasilia I bought from Ihra Potestas). Photo taken sometime in 1990 when I was a Farm Manager at Jenny Agri Marine Company in Balaring, Silay City. During this time, I never dreamt of becoming an OFW. But 14 years before I became an OFW in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 I already looked like one... hahaha with my long hair, my RayBan glasses, and yes the thick gold chain necklace. #ThrowBack #PhotographsAndMemories

#Kansi is an Ilonggo recipe that is like a cross between Bulalo (beef bone marrow and vegetables soup) and Sinigang (sour pork soup). Kansi is one of the finest Ilonggo delicacies, a  version of the famous Bulalo. The tangy and flavorful taste of Kansi and the aroma of lemon grass will surely make you love the food. On the other hand, #Kanxee for #Nepalis mean more than just food. It means your darling, your love, the apple of your eyes! @suras.suras.3 @shyamshyam4589

Chicken karaage with sriracha mayonnaise is one of the must-try dishes at The Pig & Palm. When you have sriracha mayonnaise, you can’t really go wrong with anything… especially not with The Pig & Palm’s chicken karaage. It’s a slightly heavier appetizer so tasty that you’re going to want to keep grabbing seconds. This, or the main courses? Yep, this definitely makes setting priorities difficult.

The Pig & Palm is the first Filipino restaurant from Michelin-starred British chef Jason Atherton and his wife Irha Atherton. Located in Irha’s hometown of Cebu, the restaurant offers a modern Spanish tapas menu with a focus on pork dishes. An adjoining bar serves innovative cocktails and bar snacks. The Pig & Palm is the 16th restaurant worldwide for the Athertons’ critically acclaimed restaurant group, The Social Company, which holds three Michelin stars and spans London, New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai and Sydney. The restaurant has been created in collaboration with their business partners, Cebu-based property developers Chris and Carla McKowen and architect Lyndon Neri, with the aim of bringing a taste of Spanish gastronomy to Cebu in an informal, contemporary environment. Together, Jason Atherton and head chef Karl Emsen have developed a menu of modern tapas-style sharing dishes, interpreted using the best of Filipino produce. As suggested by the restaurant’s name, dishes celebrate Cebu’s reputation as a destination for pork, with a focus on pig-based plates sourced from local farms in Cebu. In addition, a brunch menu is served from 8am to 3pm, with a range of inventive egg-based dishes. With a reputation for award-winning and innovative cocktail bars, group bar executive Jamie Jones has created a drinks menu for The Pig & Palm’s bar that blends traditional Filipino fruits and flavors with British cocktail styles. Designed by Shanghai-based studio Neri & Hu (of whom business partner and Cebu native Lyndon Neri is a founder), the design concept takes cues from Cebu’s Spanish colonial past, drawing inspiration from nearby historic monument, Fort San Pedro. In the main dining area, patterned grey bricks flow from the outside area to within. From: The Story thepigandpalm.ph www.jasonatherton.com

Eight hundred sakura trees live in Tokyo on the Meguro River. Takashi Komatsubara (@takashi_komatsubara) captured one in all its glory at night. 🌸 “The Japanese strongly feel the four seasons in their daily lives,” explains Takashi. “Many people love the cherry blossoms in spring.” #TheWeekOnInstagram Photo by @takashi_komatsubara #Repost @instagram

For centuries, the steep walls above Nepal’s upper Marshyangdi valley echoed with the staccato footsteps of horses and yaks and the quiet mantras of religious pilgrims, barely audible above the tumbling river. This was a path very few people other than the locals ever traveled. Winding high onto the Tibetan plateau, the terrain is steep and unforgiving. The valley is sealed on all sides by the Himalayas, curtained year-round with snow. ~ In the sixties and seventies, foreign trekkers began following the ancient trade routes and the valley began to ring with the windy chords of rock and roll, the whistle of pressure cookers making intricate meals and delicious local apple pies. The Annapurna Circuit became one of the most iconic trekking routes in the world, attracting upwards of 20,000 trekkers a year in its heyday. ~ The road to Manang was completed only a few years ago, adding the percussion of dynamite and the incessant clatter and growl of heavy machinery to the mix. For the first time in history, locals could reach Kathmandu in only two days - a journey that previously took weeks. ~ For all the change, this magical valley has not lost any of its rugged impossibility. The sun still sets pink and fiery upon the tallest mountains on Earth. What was once a dusty path is now shared by trekkers and mules, locals and machines alike. It’s a haven for motorcycling and is allowing climbers faster and easier access to new peaks and new routes than ever before. ~ And, above it all, the cold river still rushes below - murmuring one single syllable since the beginning of time: change. #Repost @natgeo ・・・ Photo by @renan_ozturk // words by @jetbutterflies

A very-Filipino dinner,  or should I say an Ilocano dinner for tonight - #Pinakbet #ChickenDinakdakan #MangoSalad *Pinakbet (also called pakbet) is an indigenous Filipino dish from the northern regions of the Philippines. Pinakbet is made from mixed vegetables steamed in fish or shrimp sauce. The word is the contracted form of the Ilokano word pinakebbet, meaning "shrunk" or "shriveled". * Dinakdakan is an appetizer dish that originated from the Ilocos Region. It looks like sisig except that the ingredients are not finely chopped. #CoconutMilk was used instead of that animal's brain. #FilipinoDish #PinoyFood #Filipino #Ilocano #PrepackedMeals #PreCookedMeals #LuluHypermart #OFW #BachelorLife #LivingAlone #SaudiArabia

Wat Pho, the temple of the Reclining Buddha (1781), Thanon Chetuphon, Rattanakosin area,  Bangkok The Wat Pho or “Temple of the Reclining Buddha” is one of Bangkok’s most attractive temples. It is a much visited temple complex due to its location immediately South of the Grand Palace and the huge Reclining Buddha image it houses. The temple that is officially named Wat Phra Chetuphon Wimonmangkhalaram is one of the six temples in Thailand that are of the highest grade of the first class Royal temples. The temple is famous for its enormous gold plated Reclining Buddha image. The image named Phra Phuttha Saiyat was build during the reign of King Rama III in 1832 and is 46 meters long and 15 meters high. Although the image is sometimes referred to as the lying Buddha or the sleeping Buddha, the Reclining Buddha shows the passing of the Buddha into final Nirvana after death. #WatPho #RecliningBuddha #Bangkok #Thailand #FamilyOuting #NewYearEscapade

MBK (Ma Boon Khrong)  Center is probably Bangkok's most legendary shopping mall, popular with both tourists and locals, and busy with shoppers every day. There are eight floors packed with 2,000 shops that sell everything from clothing, fashion accessories, handbags, leather products and luggage to furniture, mobile phones, electric appliances, cameras, stationery and DVDs. Launched in 1986, MBK Center is a beehive of activity, especially on weekends, when half of Bangkok converges to shop for bargains. It's not as up-market or stylish as neighbouring #SiamDiscovery, #SiamCentre and the glitzy #SiamParagon, but it offers a mind-boggling range of goods spread over 89,000 square metres and is considerably less expensive. #MBKCenter #Bangkok #Thailand #FamilyOuting #NewYearEscapade #Shopping

Looks like Bohol's #Kalamay but it's not!  It's #LakangHaringKahal! The Lakang Haring Wines have three flavours, Kahal from coconut water, Imperial Basi from sugar cane juice and Filivinum, the first Filipino-made red wine. Lakang Haring Kahal is produced in the Philippines from young coconut water under #OrdoEcclesiaris in collaboration with Institut Oenologique de Champagne (IOC)  France. It was originally commissioned by the government to toast the Philippine centennial in 1998 and was previously known as Cocovino Malakan'yan. Today, Lakang Haring Kahal is commercially available in the Philippines and is being exported to a few neighboring countries as well. Fermented from the water of young coconuts, it has a delightful flavor comparable to that of the world's finest white wines. The bottle is encased in real coconut shell, giving it a native look. With its aesthetically appealing design, Lakang Haring Kahal is ideal for gifts or corporate giveaways. Casing is natural and hand-crafted so size and details of the shell may vary. Approx. height: 6" Net Content: 450 ml.Alcohol: 12% #WhiteWine #CoconutWine 😂😂😂 Let's drink to that! 🍸🍹🍻

We don't come to the table to fight or to defend. We don't come to prove or to conquer, to draw lines in the sand or to stir up trouble. We come to the table because our hunger brings us there. We come with a need, with fragility, with an admission of our humanity. The table is the great equalizer, the level playing field many of us have been looking everywhere for. The table is the place where the doing stops, the trying stops, the masks are removed, and we allow ourselves to be nourished, like children. We allow someone else to meet our need. In a world that prides people on not having needs, on going longer and faster, on going without, on powering through, the table is a place of safety and rest and humanity, where we are allowed to be as fragile as we feel. ~Shauna Niequist,  Bread And Wine:  A Love Letter to Life Around the Table with Recipe #RaphaValley #Sanctuary #Wellness #OrganicFarm #Friends #Friendship #FriendsReunion #HealthyLiving #HealthyLifestyle #HealthyFood

Friends' reunion at Rapha Valley. Friends are a strange, volatile, contradictory, yet sticky phenomenon. They are made, crafted, shaped, molded, created by focused effort and intent. And yet, true friendship, once recognized, in its essence is effortless. Best friends are formed by time. Everyone is someone's friend, even when they think they are all alone. If the friendship is not working, your heart will know. It's when you start being less than perfectly honest and perfectly earnest in your dealings. And it's when the things you do together no longer feel right. However, sometimes it takes more effort to make it work after all. Stick around long enough to become someone's best friend. ~Vera Nazarian, The Perpetual Calendar of Inspiration #RaphaValley #Friends #Friendship #FriendsReunion #Wellness #HealthyFood #HealthyLifeStyle #Sanctuary

Here's a Time Magazine article criticizing PRRDuterte's  war on drugs. Seems that the writer is clueless about Philippine Politics. "When he was elected President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed that the "fish would grow fat" from all the criminals he killed, and every drug user and pusher would be "put either behind bars or below the ground." He's doing what he promised, and — two months and 3,000+ deaths later — shows no sign of slowing down." Here's the story of Rishi Iyengar in this week's TIME international cover. http://time.com/4495896/philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte/?xid=tcoshare

Qasr al Bint, “Palace of the Daughter or Maiden,” is the largest tomb facade at Mada’in Saleh, with a height of 16 m. It lends its name to the group of adjacent tombs. The portal is raised above ground. Above the doorway an inscription plaque indicates that it dates to circa 31 CE.

In the middle of the Jebel Ithlib is a natural slit that measures 40 m (131 feet), called the Siq, after a similar corridor at Petra. At its entrance, to the right, is a square chamber containing three stone benches that served as a triclinium for sacred feasts. Today, the chamber is known as al-Diwan (court). Its large entrance suggests that the feasts extended into the open space before it.

The most photogenic and most iconic symbol of Mada’in Saleh is Qasr al-Farid, a single tomb carved into a small dome that stands alone in the open. The façade was never finished, so the heavily chiseled surface of the lower third documents how the tombs were fashioned from the top down.

Can you see 9 faces in this painting 🎨 of The General’s Family by Octavio Ocampo? The human brain has an incredible ability to tune in to what’s important, while ignoring the rest. It’s something we often take for granted, but when you really think about it, we wouldn’t be able to drive or really do much of anything if our brains were constantly directing our attention at everything. There are many optical illusions which take advantage of how our brains process information to allow us to function. How many faces are you able to see in the picture? #opticalillusions

Do you know what the "i" in iPhone means? We’ve been seeing it for years. The iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad -- the omnipresent “i” prefix has marked most Apple products since the release of the iMac in 1998. But why? What does it mean? The "i" stands for Internet. Besides Internet, Apple's prefix also stood for individual, instruct, inform and inspire. #Apple #iPhone #Trivia #SteveJobs

The latest puzzle dividing the Internet is a seemingly straight-forward math problem, featuring apples, bananas and coconuts. But due a bit of visual trickery, those sharing the viral image since December are having trouble arriving at a clear-cut answer. The problem challenges the solver to determine the numeric value of each image of fruit. What is your answer? 14 or 16?

A bird is safe in its nest - but that is not what its wings are made for. It has to fly everyday to search for food because even if God gives every bird his worm, He does not throw it into the nest. #Work #WorkSmart #Birds #Nest

Can you tell who's the mom in this selfie? Kaylan Mahomes recently snapped a selfie of her twin sister and mom, and the Internet is flummoxed -- who is who in this photo? Is that the mom on the right ... or is that really Kaylan's twin sister? Maybe it is Kaylan herself. The selfie shows the three women sitting in a line with the caption, "Mom, twin & me." Take a look at the original tweet here: https://mobile.twitter.com/kaylan_17/status/692827112873594885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

More children than adults can figure out which way this school bus is going If you want to figure out the Internet's latest brainteaser, it's time to think like a child. National Geographic posed a question on its TV show Brain Games that is stumping many more adults than children. Take a look at this drawing of a school bus below: Can you tell which way it's headed? Now, do this simple logic problem in your head in less than a second, like any 10-year-old can. Children are much better at taking in the first visual cue given and making a snap judgement based on that cue. Adults, on the other hand, take in different visual and other sensory cues before coming to a final judgement — making their decisions slower and perhaps more thought out (though there were no specific figures as to how many adults were stumped by the problem). #BrainTeaser #InternetBrainTeaser #NationalGeographic #BrainGames #SchoolBusPuzzle Full article here by @Mashable http://mashable.com/2016/02/04/school-bus-puzzle-national-geographic/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-pete-link

MESSI FAN. In this photograph taken on January 29, 2016, Afghan boy and Lionel Messi fan Murtaza Ahmadi, 5, wears a plastic bag jersey as he plays football in Jaghori district of Ghazni province. Photo by AFP Afghan boy becomes Internet star after plastic shirt goes viral! "I want to be like Lionel Messi when I grow up,' says 5-year-old Murtaza Ahmadi. JAGHORI, Afghanistan – A five-year-old Afghan boy has become an Internet star after pictures went viral of him wearing an Argentina football shirt made out of a plastic bag, complete with his hero Lionel Messi's name. Murtaza Ahmadi has never met his idol and lives in a Taliban-controlled area of Afghanistan, but footage and photos of him wearing the improvised shirt, with Messi's named scrawled in marker pen, went round the world. Murtaza's elder brother Homayoun, 15, made him the shirt and first posted the photos of Murtaza wearing it on Facebook two weeks ago. After creating waves on social media, there were claims Argentina and Barcelona star Messi wanted to find his young fan and give him a proper jersey. Murtaza, whose father admitted he could not afford to buy him a replica jersey, said he had only a punctured ball to play with in his village in Afghanistan's Ghazni province. But he told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he idolized Messi. "I love Messi, he plays well, the shirt was made by my brother and I liked it very much," Murtaza Ahamdi said. "We do not have a football playground near our house, and the only ball I have is punctured." But he added: "I want to be like Messi, when I grow up." Internet users had quickly tried to identify the boy shown in the pictures and it was initially claimed he was an Iraqi Kurd before Murtaza's uncle Azim Ahamdi, who lives in Australia, posted pictures of his nephew and said he was the unwitting star of the story.

Talk about consistency! This picture of Mark Zuckerberg's wardrobe is hard to believe! Having a wardrobe is not cool. You know what's really cool? Grey t-shirts and hoodies. Lots of them. On Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a picture of his incredibly monochromatic wardrobe, proving once and for all that the billionaire founder really does just buy grey t-shirts and hoodies in bulk and wear them every day. "I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community," Zuckerberg once explained of the curious sartorial decision. As it turns out, many of the most successful people in the world use the same strategy to cut down on the burdens of making choices. The sneak peek at Zuckerberg's closest was shared in honor of his first day back at work following two months of paternity leave for the birth of his first child — an unusual and, hopefully, precedent-setting move for men in Zuckerberg's position.
