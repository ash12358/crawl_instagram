Bodys Isek Kingelez (Congolese, 1948-2015). Ville de S√®te 3009. 2000. "Made during a month-long residency in the South of France, this is the only work in which Kingelez incorporated electric lights. While some of its features have real-life equivalents in the actual city of S√®te, such as the H√¥tel Azur, where Kingelez stayed, others, like the Baie d‚ÄôEspoir (Bay of Hope), are pure inventions. Such seamless intermingling of the real and fictive is central to Kingelez‚Äôs work. With its gardens, bank, administrative buildings, ecological office, stadium, police station, and marina, Ville de S√®te 3009 is a highly functional, prosperous, and sparkling city‚Äîhowever, it is not of today. The title‚Äôs future tense invites us to join the artist in envisioning what he called ‚Äúa better, more prosperous world.‚Äù As a partner of contemporary Art at @themuseumofmodernart in New York, Allianz is proud to celebrate the exhibition "Bodys Isek Kingelez: City Dreams."

That‚Äôs why I enjoy the art of @toyinojihodutola. Do you ever get curious about the women around you - like this young woman leaning against the wall? I wonder about her life - if she is somewhere in Africa taking a break after work. Or maybe she is going to the market.

To truly document everyday life the medium doesn‚Äôt matter. From gritty black-and-white street photographs to high gloss color documentation and iPhone snapshots here on Instagram, the famous @stephen.shore has spent five decades capturing the worldly aspects of American pop culture in very straightforward and unglamorous images.

One of the most significant photographers of our time, @Stephen.Shore rose to prominence in the 1970s by capturing the mundane aspects of American popular culture in straightforward, unglamorous images.

In the early 1970s, @Stephen.Shore created images that would be more in tune with his time. He turned to a technique that was then largely overlooked by the art photography community ‚Äî color photography. Then in June 1972, he embarked on a road trip and began capturing everyday life. For two months, he cataloged his existence: unremarkable buildings, street signs, highway intersections, hotel rooms, television screens, people, unmade beds, plates of food, shop windows, and commercial signs. Throughout a career that has spanned five decades, Stephen has always challenged expectations, conventions and helped us see the world differently.

Another remarkable entry to the #LiveToExplore competition that captured our attention was @florianwellnhofer's serene shot and his adventurous outlook on life. "The most important lesson exploring taught me is how valuable our time is...I love the excitement of not knowing what's going to happen next, and taking a step into the unknown makes me feel alive again."

An early entry to the #LiveToExplore competition, @tha_asian_sensation encourages you to stop whatever it is you're doing and admire the simplistic beauty of his shot. His personal 'drive-in theatre', under a canopy of stars, evokes a calmness and perspective that reminds us why we love to explore. To simply stop, step-back and stargaze reminds you of the universe's immense majesty and mystery. Where is your favourite place to stargaze?

Photographer @solli_k's ominous entry to the #LiveToExplore competition captured our attention. As did her desire to explore Antarctica‚Äôs profound beauty, and document its landscape's decline from the ground and above. "This ice chunk is a part of a melting glacier. Reminding us how fragile our planet earth is. A planet filled with so much beauty that we're sadly not taking care of. If I had the opportunity, I would explore Antarctica's pristine, beautiful continent, filled with a mystery that's attracted history's brave explorers." What do you think of her haunting shot?

@joie_de_vieve was one of the first to enter the #LiveToExplore competition. Always on-the-move, accompanied by her husky and trusty camper, her outlook is remarkable, and we think it captures the explorer's spirit perfectly: "This is my life, in all its grandiose absurdity. It continues to inspire me to push forward when I get tired, lonely & unmotivated. My life on the road." What do you think of her dramatic shot?

@benn_tudor's' #LiveToExplore competition entry "takes him right back to being in the moment." We agree. His dark and dramatic POV immerses you in the anticipation of the unknown ‚Äì the excitement & adventure that lies ahead of his exploratory dive of Western Australia's Ningaloo Reef.

Here's @tidesinourveins' #LiveToExplore competition entry. "When I think of exploration, I think of Indonesia and how I only touched the surface of its beauty. I want to do three things: explore more dive sites, go deeper into the heart of Bali and Java's volcanoes, and shoot the Mentawai waves from underneath the barrel. You know something is great when it keeps drawing you back." Jeremy's desire to courageously return to Indonesia's coastlines and volcanoes typifies the explorers' bravery and spirit. What do you think of his fantastic photo?

Our judges have selected a winner, but with so many remarkable entries to our #LiveToExplore competition, over the coming weeks, we're celebrating the entries that evoked the very essence of exploration. Such as @peterdijkgraaf: "I moved to Munich two years ago. Coming from the Netherlands, which is pretty much the flattest country on Earth it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the German Alps. It's hard to describe the effort it takes to climb up a mountain and the rewarding feeling you get once you reach the top...I'd love to climb to the Basecamp of Mount Everest, Nepal and combine my passions for climbing, photography and videography." Peter's desires to push himself higher, further and harder in his life's adventures captured the explorers' spirit and captured our imagination.

Please join us in congratulating Diana, winner of our #LiveToExplore competition. In the words of @wrenees, drone adventurer on our judging panel: "@spaghetto brings together a real sense of adventure with a strong, personal story of why she dreams of exploring a particular place in a way that really touches on a human level. Exploration isn't just about personal accomplishment, but connecting with a place in a meaningful way." We couldn't have put it any better ourselves.

"This photo is of an iceberg in Disko Bay, Greenland. It's a massive island of ice that's travelled quite a way since breaking from one of the most active glaciers in the world. Taken from my drone at max altitude, you can imagine how massive this iceberg is." Drone adventurer @wrenees will help judge the winner of our #LiveToExplore competition. And if you‚Äôve been following her this far, you may have noticed that Renee is especially drawn to cold, remote places: "My most recent adventure was to Greenland, which was my first time above the Arctic Circle.

There's still 1 week for you to get involved in the competition to #WIN a life-changing opportunity ‚Äì not to mention a DJ I Mavic Pro Drone!" In this photo, while on a surfing expedition in Indonesia, @woodygphoto and his friends stopped to reflect on how many amazing parts there are to this world: "When you explore you‚Äôre bound to come across places that make you think about this incredible earth we live on ‚Äì these places are so different to the ones that are close to home and they stop you in your tracks."

"If I was to enter @allianz‚Äô amazing #LiveToExplore competition, I would love to venture to the coastal parts of Chile for its sand bottom point breaks and jaw dropping national parks. This is one of my must-see places with some close friends! Choosing to travel to faraway places involves the journey. Some of my most enjoyable moments have appeared on the journey to where you are going and the journey home. You can choose many ways to get to where you are going and each road there throws up new experiences and adventures ‚Äì new people and new places ‚Äì new stories. So, seek out an interesting way to get to where you are going ‚Äì make the journey an expedition if you can, and go for it!" In this photo @woodygphoto and his crew hit some pretty radical roads on their way to the northern parts of Indonesia. While some tried to figure out how to negotiate them, the first scout never lost sight of where they were going.

"You don‚Äôt need to go far to explore. It can be as simple as being in a place close to you, at a different time of day or night, maybe when no one else is about. Your favourite spots can reveal something different each time you go there." We're proud to partner with global explorer @woodygphoto in our #LiveToExplore competition. Over the coming weeks, he'll be sharing his personal adventures and unique stories about the corners of the world which inspire him to keep exploring ‚Äì before helping us judge the winner of our life-changing #LiveToExplore competition. In his first photo, Woody takes us to his very first memories as an adventurous young boy. Where, with his friends, he learned the fundamentals of exploring as a way of life, that shaped his outlook on the world today as a man. We hope this inspires you to think about your perfect place to explore and get involved. Then Woody himself will help us pick a winner, who'll be challenged to undertake their adventure of a lifetime! Use #LiveToExplore and tag @allianz for a chance to win.

Please join us in congratulating the second of our #EverydayExplorers competition winners, as chosen by @mortenordstrom. ‚ÄúOne piece stood out that truly holds the spirit of everyday exploration: ‚ÄòMoody Paris Reflection‚Äô by @kev_mrc. I love the tight composition and desaturated look. It also holds the quality of making the ordinary look extraordinary. Something I find very interesting. The best photos are often the ones you can't plan for and I think this one is a good example. Hopefully this will inspire others to see the beauty that surrounds them everyday, no matter where in the world they are.‚Äù

MoMA After Hours: Is this a painting, or is it a sculpture? Lee Bontecou challenged the traditional presentation of sculptures by hanging her works on a wall. Created with steel and canvas, it draws the viewer in, daring them to focus on the black cavity at the center. How does this artwork make you feel? Artist Joseph Cornell described the cavities as summoning "the terror of the yawning mouths of cannons, of violent craters, of windows opened to receive your flight without return, and the jaws of the great beasts." Share your thoughts in the comments. You can view this work in the fourth floor galleries @themuseumofmodernart. #DareTo

MoMA After Hours: @themuseumofmodernart dared to break the rules when it added the Jaguar E-Type to its design collection in 1996. This was only the third automobile to be admitted to the museum. Malcolm Sayer's beautiful design set it apart from' anything else on the road with Enzo Ferrari calling it "the most beautiful car ever made‚Äù.

MoMA After Hours: French painter, Michel Parmentier created this striking composition by folding the canvas and then spraying the remaining parts with lacquer to create alternating bands of identical colour. An advocate of minimalism, Parmentier was part of BMPT, a group of four artists who challenged conventional ideas about art. Their defiance of tradition was incredibly daring at a time when contemporary art was being used as a medium for political messages. Does art have to contain a meaning for you to enjoy it?

MoMA After Hours: Why do you take photos of your friends? Nan Goldin used photography as a visual diary, capturing candid moments with her friends in the 70s & 80s.

Need some #inspiration for our #DareTo competition? Alexander "Sandy" Calder is one of modernism's most famous artists. Before Calder, sculpture was mostly considered a stationary art form, but Calder was interested in bringing his works to life. This is "Sandy's Butterfly." Constructed from painted sheet steel and iron rods, it sways in the wind, bringing a new element of delight to the viewer's experience. Take inspiration from Calder and break away from the traditional and established, and dare to challenge conventions! For your chance to #win a visit to @themuseumofmodernart in New York and experience this sculpture in person, take a photo or video that creatively defines courage. Post your image with its backstory on Instagram with #DareTo and mention @Allianz in the post to enter. Full Ts&Cs available from link in our bio.

Here‚Äôs some #inspiration for our #DareTo competition. Bruce Nauman, an American sculptor, was inspired by the hypnotic aura of neon advertisements to expose the irony of what ads sell us. We all have human wants, they are as simple as things we need, dream, desire, and hope for. The words in Nauman‚Äôs piece light up in a pulsing cycle, continually evoking and replacing meaning, just as our own wants constantly shift. This artwork, called "Human/Need/Desire," is in the collection of @themuseumofmodernart, where the artist will be the subject of a major retrospective in 2018. If you want/desire/hope to visit New York soon then read on. For your chance to win a trip to #NewYork and a VIP tour of @themuseumofmodernart, take a photo that creatively defines courage and post your image on Instagram with #DareTo and tag @Allianz in the post to enter.

Presented for the first time since its inaugural exhibition at @themuseumofmodernart in 1995, Teiji Furuhashi's ‚ÄúLovers" returns to the Museum on 30th July. Created just one year before the Japanese artist's death, this room-sized multi-media installation features life-sized figures who move around the room in a choreographed loop, overlapping but never touching. Enter our #DareTo Instagram competition now and you could be visiting this exhibition on your very own private tour in December. To enter, take a photo or video that creatively defines courage and post on Instagram with #DareTo and tag @Allianz in the post. (Closes 11:59pm on 16/08/2016 18+ only) Photo ‚í∏ARTLAB, Canon Inc.
