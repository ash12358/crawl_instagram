I’m fascinated by labyrinths, especially this one we encountered last month while in Orlando for a wedding. Enter the labyrinth with a question or meditative thought and walk along its winding path. The twists and turns changing your perspective, stimulating cross brain thinking where new ideas and insights emerge, unwinding and releasing the stored energy, and harnessing moments of flow. With a fractured heart at its center that honors the victims of the shooting at Pulse nightclub and the names of the 49 souls along its perimeter, the path made for a meaningful journey to its center. Where the labyrinth is placed has its own reflective power like the ones we encountered hiking the Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve during a short stay back in the Bay Area. Ten million years ago, lava from the depths of the Earth flowed through that exact spot giving the labyrinth another measure of energy as we traversed its winding path. Two others I’m sharing including one from the Bali silent meditation retreat center I visited in October of last year and another from the back yard of a friend and labyrinth expert in beautiful Lisbon, Portugal. Thanks @laura_pt for teaching @derekbroo and myself all about this beautiful form. #labyrinth #labyrinths #meditation #orlando #florida #unitedorlando #bayarea #california #bali #indonesia #lisbon #portugal #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Filled my inner engineering geek with excitement witnessing these three sailboats share the lane with two tank ships through the Miraflores locks on the Panama Canal.  The entire process of lowering the ships through their 11 hour journey through the canal is super interesting, but the history of getting this thing made is even more fascinating. While there is a museum at the locks, if you go, be sure to check out the Panama Canal Museum in the original French Canal Company headquarters in downtown Panama City for a more rich experience. Our AirBnB sat at the very end of the West Coast of the canal, and our bonus was a view of the ships coming and going into the canal all day and night, open 12 hours east and then 12 hours west. So many different types of ships! #panamacanal #panamacity #mirafloreslocks #panama #exporetheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Asesinos ... killers Fascinating being in Colombia over its congressional election with the former Farc guerrila fighters running for seats for the first time as part of its peace settlement just a few years ago. They had fought the government for 50 years and the peace deal earned the Colombia President Juan Manuel Santo the Nobel Peace Prize. For security no alcohol was served from 6pm Saturday night before Election Day until 6am the following Monday. Farc didn’t win but is still guaranteed seats as part of the peace agreement. #nobelpeaceprize #farc #bogota #colombia #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Impressive fortress built by the Spanish beginning in the 16th century and expanding its fortifications of the strategic seaport of Cartagena for the next 200 years. My favorite part of the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, as it is now called, was the intricate tunnel system throughout its interior which was created to serve as a last stand against an invader allowing the Spanish enough time to blow it all up. We just had fun getting lost within it. #cartagena #colombia #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Graffiti, hip hop and the revitalization of the most dangerous neighborhood in what was the most dangerous city in the world in the early 90s... Our tour of Comuna 13, courtesy of @graffitour , showcased the work of so many amazing graffiti artists telling the story of an area of Medellin that was once controlled by the most aggressive and ruthless Colombian’s drug trafficking organization. After 21 military operations culminating with a final major operation using over 800 federal troops and two Blackhawk helicopters that easily tore through the tin roof buildings, the community began a rebirth from the ashes.

Felt pretty special to view the beautiful temporary memorial for the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled the country for 70 years. An ornate Royal Crematorium was built during the year mourning his death and culminated in a funeral procession to this final place. Until the year end, the space is an exhibit looking at the life of what was the world’s longest reigning monarch. Everywhere we’ve been in Bangkok, the love and respect for him is prevelant. #bangkok #thailand #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

“Impermanence is inescapable. Everything vanishes.” Buddhism is a way of life in Luang Prabang, Laos. Temples fill what is one of my favorite cities we’ve come through.

Found this monument to show where Senator John McCain was shot down at Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi so interesting. Featuring a person on his knees, arms raised in surrender, our guide says it’s considered a victory monument for the Vietnamese.

Emerging from 7 days of silence, yoga, and meditation at @BaliSilentRetreat in rural Bali. Silent contemplation with no Internet for a week is an unique experience and quite a challenge. Definitely one of the more difficult experiments I’ve done. Special thanks to the great yoga and meditation instructors as well as the team at @NewEarthCooking for our delicious, local vegatarian food, which was perfect for mindful eating. One takeaway: I didn’t miss meat, alcohol, or even talking that much. What I could feel was the need to want to have access to the Internet, for the random nature of the most addictive apps to deliver a dopamine release.

Spread over two floors, not only does it have several food style areas, a movie room, a pool table, two PlayStation rooms (one designed for kids and one for adults), two grand pianos, an electric race car area, showers, and masseuses, it also had a driving range. Finally got to get some golfing in on this journey. It’s open 24hrs ... I want to move in!

“Nowhere you can go is more peaceful, more free of interruptions, than your own soul…Retreat to consult your own soul and then return to face what awaits you.” Was surprised to run into this sculpture of Marcus Aurelius at the Istanbul history museum, the Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD. He kept a daily diary of sorts now compiled for our modern day reading called Meditations that helped him face the adversity of life based on the Stoic philosophy. It’s an excellent read and is considered by many to be the definitive text on self-discipline, personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength. This is one of my favorite quotes from the book. #stoicism #stoicphilosophy #istanbul #turkey #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Medusa on her head after being moved from somewhere in the Roman Empire to the water storage Basilica Cistern in Istanbul as a pedestal for a support column in the underground structure.

The Olympic torch relay originated at the 1936 Summer Olympics, carrying the flame from Greece to the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. It now has been done every Olympics since then. Just one of the many fascinating facts we discovered at Berlin's Olympiastadion, the host of those pre-WWII Olympic games where the spirit of unity and community at the heart of the International Olympic Committee’s mission collided with the ideology of Nazism. It was here Jesse Owens won four gold medals and ended Hitler's myth of Aryan supremacy. I asked why it didn’t get destroyed in the war, and one of the theories is that it’s size and shape was ideal in a pre-GPS world as a visual guide to help planes navigate from the West into Berlin. It’s location and open spaces were also ideal for a post-war military base. It became home to the British forces after the victory over the Nazis. Today, it’s a beautiful soccer, track & field, and concert stadium. #olympics #jesseowens #olympicflame #WWII #olympiastadion #stadiumtour #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Scotland is home to many comic book legends including Mark Millar, Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, the latter who resides in Glasgow where we visited the best comic book exhibit I've ever seen. Housed in the historic @glasgowkelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum at the University of Glasgow, the exhibit is a deep dive into Quitely's gorgeous visual storytelling and collaborations with Millar and Morrison. Fun fact: the Glaswegians call Quitely by his actual name, Vincent Deighan, or Vinny as Morrison said when talking about being the only one he trusts to bring his brilliant storytelling to life. #comicbooks #superheroes #batman #superman #allstarsuperman #batmanandrobin #glasgow #scotland #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Impressive bronze equestrian statue at the main square Praça do Comércio (Commerce Square) in Lisbon where we started another great podcast audio tour by @ricksteveseurope. The statue features King José I who oversaw the rebuilding of Lisbon after a devastating earthquake which caused a tsunami and then fires that destroyed most of the city and killed 100k Lisboans. I dug the snakes the horse is stomping on to symbolize how easily the Portuguese vanquished its enemies at the height of its empire. The King is looking out at the Tagus river where all the riches of Portugal flowed in from its colonies.  #lisboa #lisbon #portugal #statue #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Standing atop beautiful Lisbon on the lookout deck of The Elevador de Santa Justa. It's designed by a student of the tower guy, Gustave Eiffel, and was originally built to lift people up a steep hill in the middle of the city. We rode a funicular up the hill. Behind me above the historic center of the city are two sites on our Lisbon site seeing list, Saint George Castle and the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jerónimos Monastery, on my right. #lisboa #portugal #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

At a stop during our walking tour led by the great @ricksteveseurope podcast. The Plaza Mayor was once the center of Madrid. We learned about the mix of activities in the plaza from bullfighting, to public executions during the Spanish Inquisitions, to the drinking and refreshments enjoyed in the space today. @derekbroo stands in front of the statue of King Phillip III whose father moved the capital to Madrid. #spain #exploretheworld #traveler #keepexploring

Snapped this shot of the Puerta de Alcalá on our run to its neighbor, the beautiful Parque del Retiro.

Up early this morning to eagerly start reading my galley copy of @nilofermerchant's new book The Power of Onlyness - Make Your Wild Ideas Mighty Enough to Dent the World. It's the inspiring stories she shares on how anyone can make an impact, ideas that have influenced me during our many walk and talks, including the one we got soaked in during a Silicon Valley downpour yesterday. It begins chapter one with this great Mary Oliver quote, "Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?" #onlyness #purpose #leadership #innovation #entrepreneurship
