It would be nice if those of us that walk these paths could figure out how to do for ourselves what we so effortlessly do for others.

Here‚Äôs my first bit of homework I had to do before week 2: following examples, write out in hiragana the proper sentences (and responses where necessary). I took it further and wrote the r≈çmaji so I could review easily while I‚Äôm still learning the hiragana syllabary. . . . . . . . . . . . #japanese #language #study #nihongo #minnanonihongo #japanesemelbourne #languagestudy #japanesestudy #homework #„Å´„Åª„Çì„Åî #Êó•Êú¨Ë™û #„Åó„ÇÖ„Åè„Å†„ÅÑ

Love looking back at things that have happened over the years. Here‚Äôs me in the NSW bush as a becloaked photogm‚Äôn at my friend @lucycavendish‚Äôs wedding. So many fond memories spring up surrounding a single moment in time like this.

Work on the novel is fully and finally underway, with chapter/sub-chapter titles in place, main character movements plotted, and chapter overviews written up to almost chapter six. Next step: write the damn novel! Haha! . . . . . . . . . . . #writing #novel #fantasy #author #aspiringauthor #dream #dreams #herewego #finally #awen #merulia #magic #fiction #novelwriting

Mainly posting this for myself so I can reflect back and see just how much I actually *did* Belive In Myself in 2018. . . . . . . . . . . . #tarot #theplangame #spread #tarotreading #acting #decisions #howto #thepath #manifest #direction #understanding #peekbehindmybraincurtain #thoth #thothtarot #crowley #aleistercrowley #crowleythoth #thehermit #hermit #actor #actorlife #actorslife #planning #2018

After I rearranged my room, I was clear to setup my small altar again, and gifted my Quan Yin and Buddha statues with a solar system bracelet for them to wear as necklaces, bringing their energies to/from the cosmos as well as to our home.  I‚Äôm so happy to have them set up and next to my bed again, though I do need to start filling the space above on the wall again. üíú . . . . . . . . . . . #druid #altar #guanyin #buddha #bodhisattva #kuanyin #ËßÇÈü≥ #buddhism #meditation #reflection #relaxation #zhenshanren #qigong #falungong #falundafa #aum #om #druidry #philosophy #esoteric #esoterica #githelgerel
