Lamb was on sale at my local butchers (shout out to @sanagansmeatlocker for their excellent service every time) so I tried to recreate cumin lamb skewers from those chinese street food festivals. It's really the taste of summer for me, the spicy cumin flavours with juicy lamb meat. I marinated the lamb leg pieces in soy sauce and xiaoxing wine first before skewering them and browning on the cast iron. While they sizzle, I sprinkled with a spice mixture of cumin, ground pepper, pepper flakes and kosher salt. #homecook #homechef #lamb #dinner #food #carnivore #amateurcook

Enjoyed a very unusual dessert today. It's the kanten ramen dessert from dessert house. Fruit flavored syrup poured over slippery blue jelly noodles that cover a mango and gluten-y rice balls concoction kept cold on shaved ice. Juicy fresh fruit balls round out the bowl. Very novel! #dessert #hkdessert #foodporn #torontoeats #foodadventures #fruits #toronto

This Chef's menu at @thecarbonbar was mind and gut blowing! Im back in my Toronto HQ now and had a southern BBQ experience, and it was delicious 😋. Proptip: maybe don't indulge in this right before bikini season. Or if you're one of those badasses that shun societal norms and expectations do what pleases you, try this menu, and schedule the bypass surgery later. Carbon bar special menu serves up generous plates of smokey sweet ribs, soft, fall-apart brisket, amazing side sauces, soft shell duck tacos with crispy skin (that crispy skin was sensational), flaky fish, crunky fried chicken (it's the next step up from crunchy), buttery collard greens, and finishes with a delicate cheesecake that's been a bit sunburned on top and comes with boozy chocolate skull bites to remind you that life is short and sweet, just eat all the things 'cause you'll die sooner or later. Nom.

Who knew corn nuts in a salad could be so good. Went to Brave Horse for their deep fried cheese curds, and got the salad with thyme vinaigrette to even things out. Yes that's right. Deep. Fried. Cheese curds. Plus smoked spice tater tots, and a house made pretzel with peanut butter and bacon bits. But those cheese curds man, crunchy on the outside and chewy, mildly salty cheese taste on the inside. They even squeak between your teeth. So good. #foodporn #foodie #seattle #washingtonstate #Restaurant #lunch

Wowee wowee, this Schilling cold brew "Grumpy Bear" is so delicious. Who knew cold brew and cider would make such a delicious combo. It's like a sweetened coffee drink with a wonderful coffee aroma. The sweet fruit and slight coffee bitterness is so well balanced, it makes for a delightful drinking experience. #beer #seattle #coldbrew #cider What else do I hashtag this, lol?

When in Seattle, of course have clam chowder. The best place is Pike Place Chowder, where they offer their best 8 soups as a sampler platter with fresh sourdough bread. My favorites were the classic New England clam chowder, the market special crab and lobster chowder, plus the seared scallops chowder. Also on the menu was a smoked salmon chowder and seafood bisque. The flavours that got left behind was the coconut and lime, and the Manhattan style chowder. Coconut and lime didn't taste as vibrant as it sounds, and Manhattan style was wayyyyy too salty. Get there early or prepare to wait in line! #Seattle #seafood #foodie #travel #tourist #northwestpacific #foodpics  #lunch

Did someone ask for more food pics? No? OK here's some more food pics. Japonessa in Seattle is well know for their signature sushi rolls you can't find anywhere else. Their use of fresh fish ingredients plus other creative flavours makes for a wonderful food experience. I love spicy food, so their Barcelona and Diabla Say roll, which includes a great kick from habañero, was totally tasty to me. I even got a seaweed and octopus salad with little baby bite-sized octopi looking up at me before I chowed down and enjoyed the great combination of tangy sweet flavours and wet crunchy textures. #Restaurant #Seattle #washingtonstate #foodie #sushi #tourist #seafood #WestCoast #foodpics

Had a wonderful lunch today in beautiful sunny Victoria with family. I found an article about @nubotapas in a local eats magazine and suggested we head there for lunch for their special teishoku lunch sets. The sashimi and sushi were super fresh, soft and tasty, and the variety of delicious sides really made the meal fun to eat. There were crunchy and soft textures, sweet flavours, savory, fried foods and fresh. What a great place to enjoy real Japanese flavours! #japanesefood #lunch #VictoriaBC #BritishColumbia #foodporn #foodie #foodpics #sushi

Our waiter at Miku Vancouver recommended Jam for breakfast in Victoria, and boy it did not disappoint. We went with the crowd favorite, chicken and waffles, as well as the Charlie bowl and then had to add a side of deep fried pancake battered sausage on a stick. Hash potatoes, chicken gravy, peas, cheese, crumbled biscuits and eggs made up the contents of the ginormous Charlie bowl. The battered chicken was so juicy and flavourful. That maple butter tasted like liquid gold. Okay I better start walking this off, I should work it off if I walk home to Toronto from here, right? #VictoriaBC #foodporn #breakfast #foodie #goodeats #delicious #travel #highlyrecommended #BritishColumbia

Visited Miku Vancouver and enjoyed a lovely Aburi 3 (4?) course dinner. It was a stellar experience and the service was impeccable. The darling waiter who brought the desserts actually ran around the corner to wait while I was in the bathroom, and upon my return and being seated proceeded to come out of hiding and present our desserts at the same time. The food was fresh and delicious, my favorite bites are always the wagyu beef and otoro bits. Their flavours just overwhelmed my taste buds with so much delightful tastiness. Thanks to my darling husband for being so clever and making advanced Reservations for a window seat, we also got to enjoy the wonderful Harbour view. It was a great way to spend my last evening in Vancouver.

My compliments to all the staff at @akirabacktoronto for an amazing evening at their gorgeous Toronto restaurant. This was the finishing dish with four desserts and lovely message to personalize the meal for my evening out with my ladies. Yuzu citrus curd, matcha mousse, apple harumaki, and black sesame cheesecake lie in waiting on this lovely charcoal canvas, ready to take your mouth on a waltz through the parkette of flavours. I was super pleased with the level of attention the food and service received all night long, and hope the restaurant can maintain this level of excellence. Will need to take the husband on a date here next time. #torontoeats #toronto #foodporn #culinaryplating #foodie #restaurant #dessert #dinner #plating #torontofood

Here in Toronto, we're so spoiled for choice in food. The diversity of flavours found in the Chef's Assembly hall is like a mini world tour of flavours, there's food stands featuring authentic dishes from a myriad of different countries. Here's the takoyaki and hiyayakko (tofu topped with bamboo, chili and spring onions) with their house made ginger ale from Isshin Ramen. The Bonito flakes are so full of umami, and the takoyaki are springy with a great chew. The tofu is really fresh and light, just what I'm feeling tonight. I need to come back when half the places I want to try aren't sold out of their best dishes, lol. #foodporn #japanesefood #toronto #torontoeats #tdot #goodeats

Best place to watch people get pulled over for violating rules of a traffic experiment in Toronto is Home of the Brave. Even better then that is gorging on their delicious crispy fried chicken and cheesy tater tots with a pint of craft beer. I went for the Italian Insetto plum sour ale but there were also some tasty left field collabs available when I was there a few days ago. If there's a king street business worth supporting, it's this place. #toronto #foodporn #craftbeer #Restaurant #goodfood #noms #torontoeats

We saved some money on our phone bill today so that means we get to go splurge on something right? Chose to stop by @merchant_sons to pick up their ultra luxurious sweatshirt robe. It's a house robe made with super soft cotton knit hoodie material, so like you're wearing a hoodie but also a wizard robe. The quality is amazing, it's fully lined, has deep pockets, sewn on waist tie so you'll never lose it, ribbed cuffs so it'll stay up when you pull the sleeves up and feels like lazy Sundays. Best of all, it's Canadian made. #hoodie #comfort #chill #lazysundays #giftideas #madeincanada #Toronto #shopping #giftsforhim

Food pic spam incoming! My darling husbando took me to Miku for their kaiseki dinner for my birthday and we enjoyed a number of delicious dishes infused with Japanese flavours and presentation. I think my favorites were the seared scallop, the wagyu beef sushi, the sous vid beef filet and the Jasmine green tea ice cream. I also discovered a love of yuzu wine, hehe.

So there's a potato dashi Ramen?! With matchstick potatoes??? And sour cream with chives in it??!!??? 😱😱😱 what a time to be alive. Verdict: It was *okay*, never been a fan of Japanese yam though, it feels super slimey. I don't feel like there was the same level of umami as their other dishes. Nice as an unique veg option though. #foodporn #japanesefoodish #ramen #dinner #torontoeats #toronto

#summerlicious duck breast from the menu at Sassafraz today with my darling, it was really tasty! There was so much going on, roasted cauliflower, bits of bacon, brussel sprouts, fennel puree, orange slices, toasted nuts and some sort of grand Marnier sauce, nummmmm~~~ The best bit is when they seat you in the couches by the big open windows and you get to see the fancy cars whizzing by. There is someone driving around Toronto in a call of duty branded SUV. Ya rly.

Tried @mary_berg3 spaghetti recipe for dinner today, had to add some bacon to mine, sorry not sorry. Lemon, parmesan, olive oil, parsley, salt and pepper and smokey bacon sounds like a weird combo, but it works great!

When in Japan....have English afternoon tea! Found the Anne-Marie Cafe in Nara after visiting the deer park and had a spot of tea (or technically coffee because I pointed to the wrong thing on the menu) sitting amongst decor reminiscent of an English grandmother's house, complete with floral wallpaper, doilies and wooden woodland creature mantle decor. Afterwards we went to the craft beer and wine place around the corner and had Belgium beers. Hah! #afternoontea #nara #japan #sweets

The sakura trees in the southern parts of Japan have mostly shed their petals now, they pave the paths in pretty pink.

Pretty proud of this haul from GU Japan. Their sailoroon collab is going on and there were racks of t-shirts with sailor moon (and dragon ball z) themes for all you 90's kids, plus awesome Luna and Artemis bags.

The kuro okonomiyaki manju is a black bao you can get from the fushimi Inari shrine near the end of the trails. It's a hot steamed bun with gooey, what I think is seafood flavor filling. Not bad after a long hike around the torii gates. ⛩ ⛩ ⛩ #japan #japanesefood #tourist

On my adventures through the famous bamboo forests of Kyoto, I encountered a couple of women dressed as maiko. I am not super familiar with the differences between real geishas and tourists dressed up as geiko or maiko, so I don't know if they're real, but they were in a major tourist spot with their own photographers posing for shoots in the daytime so I think they're just dressed up locals modeling for a photoshoot. Still looked really awesome and attracted a loooot of attention. #kyoto #geisha #maiko #geiko #japan #beauty #modelling #kimono #spring #bamboo

I swear these dango were either going to kill me or give me horrible digestive issues. They looked like the ones you see in anime so I just *had* to have one. After they took my money, I saw them grab the dango out with their bare hands, put them inside a microwave on the un-cleaned turning plates, and took them out with dirty looking tongs. One of them flipped the paper container it was held in, and kind of touched the dirty countertop. So, ya! If you don't see me again, it'll be because of these adorable looking things!

Ryokan yukata life, now this I can get used to. After the hectic hubbub of Tokyo, it's nice to settle back and relax for a few days in the hot springs areas around Hakone. Only issue is there are few pokestops around our secluded and rural-ish onsen ryokan. Nothing interesting to catch around here. :/

Went to the ultra tourist attraction, robot restaurant, and selfie'd with a local. I went into this show not really understanding what I bought tickets for, and I still don't really know what I watched. It was like a comical underground Caribana parade with EDM and cosplay mixed with animatronics written by a bunch of drunk otakus. There could be some deep metaphorical message about the meaning of life in there but I can't figure it out because I'm too overstimulated by lasers and taiko drums and heavy metal guitar solos and fire. Also I can't get over the fact that you could buy Dom Perignon to enjoy during the show for a meer 60,000 yen or something super affordable like that. #robotrestaurant #shinjuku #japan #tourist #selfie

Random wanderings brought us to a craft beer bar. With twenty Japanese and Scandinavian beers on tap, this seemed as good a place as any to wet our throats and wait out the fickle Tokyo rain. Here is the Baird beer saison sayuri on the left, light and fruity, and the Nøgneø Sunturn brew barley wine, a strong flavourful beer. His and hers. #craftbeer #tokyo #beer

This game is....wow. Just....wow. Wow music. Wow graphics. Wow game play. Wow character movements. Wow character designs. Wow environments. I'm went in with no expectations and never played the original and I experienced such amazing sensory inputs I don't even know how to express them except by flailing my hands around and gesturing emphatically like I've lost my mind. There's so many amazing games to play right now but this one should be on the top of anyone's list. Someone please share the burden of my feels for this game for it is too much for me. What a wonderful time to be alive. I'm sick today, but alive! #squareenix #nierautomata #playstation #ps4 #videogames #2B

I've come up with a new recipeh! Tried to recreate Iggy's veggie medley stew from Final Fantasy XV, which is an amazing game, really the most fun I've had from a video game in a long time. Here I've used shiitake, king oyster, brown beech and white button mushrooms, as well as carrots, onions, watercress, thyme and soy sauce. Also used lots of pepper because I love the heavy taste of pepper and mushrooms. The mushrooms are really juicy but shrink a lot when cooked so make sure you really pack it in! Now, I wonder if my local butcher carries gigantoad steak. #homechef #finalfantasyxv #ffxv #ignis #soup #vegetarian

An afternoon treat from from @butteravenue courtesy of the boss. Perfection as always, the St. Honoré lychee raspberry tart is full of luscious fruit flavors, bursting on the tongue with every bite.

Vday dinner at home, away from the overpriced and overbooked restaurant lines~ I thank all the TV chef personalities and YouTube channels that taught me all the cooking tips and tricks to cook at home.

The rabbit and snails with artichokes on rice from @lenarestaurante last night, deeeelicious. Never had such succulent snails before :D Rice was fragrant and soft, tomato sauce was super flavourful.

That time I went to see the Nintendo Switch event at their Toronto stop. They did not cheap out in this promotion, let me tell you. Free games everywhere! Free hats! Walking Mario mascot and of course this Mariokart photo op display! The switch looks much more modern, sleeker and more compact. The small controllers feel super flimsy and light though, like fisher price baby-safe toys. Easily fixed by getting the pro controller. Sort of worth getting up at 7:30am in the morning to experience, heh. Too bad no playable demo of fire emblem warriors, the tecmo koei warriors series are my jam~~~ #nintendoswitch #consoles

Some of my favorite signs from the "wall of solidarity" today on the fence outside Osgoode Hall in Toronto after the Toronto women's march. Let us come together in dark times to raise each other up. It was nice to be among happy and peaceful women, children, and also all the lovely men who support women's rights and the stand against racism, bigotry, sexism and hate. I was especially warmed to see many mothers and fathers pointing to the signs and telling their daughters to be strong and do anything they want because they're powerful and the future will be theirs. #womensmarch #toronto #lovenothate

Happy pride day! Proud to be an ally, and support the continued effort for an equal and loving society~🌈 ♥ Also solemnly remembering the victims of hate in Orlando and elsewhere, it saddens me that ignorance can drive fools to such cowardly actions, and breaks my heart to know there are people out there afraid to live as their true self. I feel lucky and grateful that our city of #Toronto has such a great showing of support for #prideparade2016 to let everyone know that it's okay to be who you are and love who you love! #lotd #selfie #makeup #pride #lgbtqally

Aboard a viking ship, Odin's Ravens stand watch perched near the ship's steering wheel, believed to provide protection to the captain and crew on their aquatic journey. They fly ahead to scout for dangers and fly back with news for the captain so that they may find safe passage through dangerous seas and unknown waters.

Afternoon snack, found at a "farmer's market" today. Takoyaki! My favourite! Some restaurants these days cheat and deep fry their balls in a vat, which makes me sad, but the real deal needs a special iron griddle for best taste and texture.

Another Anime North find, this shirt from local designer and artist @oceaninspace. I lucked out and got the last size small at her booth, this shirt is an absolute gem!

This year's Anime North haul. Cat sold separately. Let me declare my absolute adoration for the nominichi, where I scored the sailor moon locket things for about $8 each, instead of the $25 normally being asked for around the dealer's room. My inner frugal asianess cackled maniacally when I found those. Also the harvest moon Miku was kind of Anime North related and I'm so proud to finally have her, shes absolutely adorable. It's been a good con~ #animenorth #animenorth2016 #manga #haul #otaku #nerd #cat

Patio weather meal at the Amsterdam Brewery by Lake Ontario yesterday. Featuring Amsterdam brewery's sweetwater radler sangria, soft pretzel and chicken schnitzel with rapini in lemon sauce.

Late night take out dinner from R&D, the restaurant started by masterchef Canada winner Eric and "demon chef" Alvin. The CSB (char siu bao) is amazing, delicious juicy pork pieces in a crusty pastry-topped bun. Chili venison spring rolls, also very good, larger than expected. Finally the beef curry on the bottom, very flavourful, meat is juicy, just altogether good life decisions. #masterchef #foodporn

Only a half hour wait at new Japanese dessert place Tsujiri for a refreshing matcha and vanilla soft serve! Their matcha maple and salt latte was also very delicious! #Toronto #dessert

The closest I've gotten my girlfriend to look like Hatsune Miku. I don't want to change her name from Furniture though... #waifu #nizikano #dreamgirlfriend #vocaloid #animegirl #kawaii

Just received my Miku Expo glow stick, in support of the 2016 Miku concert tour! The cat seems to think it's a super sized laser pointer or something. Please try to refrain from making dildo jokes kthnx. XD

Tried to make zabaglione, didn't have enough egg yolk. T-T. Here is just a regular strawberry dessert with grand marnier custard and a nadege green tea macaron. #foodporn #homechef #dessert

Today: adventures in pasta making without a pasta roller! First attempt at home made pasta, using a rolling pin and brute strength. Finished with Alfredo sauce and criminal amounts of parmesan cheese. It tasted nice and was chewy but probably too thick. Buon appetito~

Made personal oden stew for dinner tonight. Used pork and chicken stock base with some chili for a warming winter evening broth. My favourite foods in this kind of thing is tendon beef balls, baby corn, shitake, daikon, lotus root, baby bok choy and salmon slices. #foodporn #homecooking

Got stopped by these gorgeous babes today. New Giuseppe Zanotti Design shoes, spotted at The Bay. You can almost see the drool spilling out of my face reflected in the shoes. #shoeporn

My humble bowl of Shin Ramyun. With leftover rib roast, daikon and lettuce. One week later and I'm still eating leftovers. Lol.
