I wrote this post for @lencollective but it is worth repeating. If you are not enraged, you are not paying attention! This is not an immigrant issue or even a political issue...this is a HUMAN issue! If we refuse to defend those in this world without a voice and no choice over their circumstances, we have truly lost our humanity. No child should have to feel the terror of being ripped apart from their family...a family who has already risked so much to seek asylum from conditions many of us cannot even fathom. We are causing irreparable psychological trauma to these children! No matter their countries of origin, these are fragile HUMAN BEINGS, not a bartering chip for some sick political game. Families deserve to be together! We must use our voices to speak up for those who cannot! And when the time comes...we must use our vote! • Please swipe through the images. Don’t look away. The little boy in the second to the last image was torn away from his family and assigned a number. To our government he is now #47. Like a prisoner of war...like a stockyard animal! • “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.” • #keepfamiliestogether #familiesbelongtogether #wherearethechildren #callcongress #callyourcomgressmen #votetrumpout #votethemout #fucktrump 📷 Thank you for these powerful images @therealdebramessing @jbmoorephoto @stevedressler @washingtonpost

Be kind to each other. Be kind to yourself. It’s a tough world out there and so many are fighting battles we will never even know about. If you are struggling, you are not alone and you don’t need to suffer in silence. Reach out...even though it may feel like the hardest thing to do! You matter! Your life and story have meaning! The world needs you! • If you see someone struggling it’s okay to ask “are you ok.” Talking about suicide does not cause suicide. It’s time to work towards ending the stigma towards suicide and mental health struggles. Be a part of the conversation. Share your story. We share more commonality through our struggles than through anything else. Nobody should ever have to feel that they are alone. We are in this mad mad world together! • National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255 • US Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741 • To Write Love on Her Arms @TWLOHA has a list of US resources as well as INTERNATIONAL help links! #suicideprevention #suicideawareness #mentalhealth #depression #anxiety #endthestigma #pleasestay #theworldneedsyou Images from @superfurry and Pinterest

It’s the end of Mental Health Awareness Month, so I want to talk about something real for a moment. • Do you ever find yourself caught up in the comparison game between the “perfect lives” you see online vs. what your real life looks like? Both hands way up over here. We all want to present our best selves to the world and curate beauty. There is absolutely nothing wrong or shameful about this…the world needs more beauty and goodness in it! The part that sucks is the times when we struggle to separate a representation on the screen from reality, and begin to see ourselves as less-than or somehow failing as a reflection of these images. The truth is that we never really know what is going on behind the lens. • Like so many others, I have struggled immensely with depression and anxiety throughout my life. There is nothing pretty about being curled up in bed too riddled with self-doubt and sadness to move, or glamorous about an anxiety attack that leaves you shaken and drained. For me personally, there are times when I post a pretty photo in a desperate effort to find just one little glimmer of light in my day…a big F-you to depression, because I’m just not willing to let it rob me of anything else. I’m sure that I’m not the only one who utilizes Instagram posts as a welcome bit of escapism, right? “An image isn’t the full picture.” • My point for this little tangent isn’t for pity, but rather to say that if you too struggle with any or all of these things…you’re not alone. Be gentle with yourself. Your worth is not determined by what others are doing/sharing online. It’s okay if all you did today was survive! 💕 #mentalhealthawareness #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth #yourenotalone #aquietstyle 📸 by my daughter

If you know me at all, then you know that I rarely if ever feel comfortable in front of a camera. But yesterday my daughter put me instantly at ease and captured these shots. Her photos are wonderful, but what I know I’ll treasure most of all when looking through these images in the future, is the memory of getting to spend that time creating with her again. 👭🌼 I’m still learning how to be the mom of an adult daughter. But I know how important it is to treasure the beautiful but rare times we now have together. It all goes by so fast (just like they always said it would)!

Today I light a candle as a small gesture of love and support for Kerri @tenthingsjewelry and her family who lost their precious daughter in a tragic accident on her 22nd birthday a few days ago. I cannot even fathom the kind of excruciating pain that they must be going through from this devastatingly unexpected loss. There just are no words. Mikaela was the light of her family’s life and had a heart full of compassion for neglected animals. She recently shared with her mom that felt it was her calling to do all she could to aid and find shelter for abandoned pets. Because of this, her friends and family have joined together to keep her dream alive through a gofundme page with all donations being given to Mikaela’s favorite animal shelter. If you feel moved to share her story or donate to further her dream, a link to the gofundme page can be found in profile @nicolecalvo or directly at www.gofundme.com/Mikaela-Jones . I know it would mean a great deal to her loved ones. 💕⭐️🌙 Mikaela’s light will never go out! It will be shining on through all who knew and loved her. So much love being sent your way Kerri 💕⭐️🌙
