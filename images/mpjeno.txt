I'm really glad I took some pictures of my daughter nursing (not this pic, but in this set). It was hard. And we weren't very good at it ... ever. But we were EBF for 3 months and now that I can look back on it, I can treasure that time with her and what I was able to provide.

I love our zoo. Today Ev and I were 2 of the first few people in, and while so many folks stopped at the aquarium or headed straight for the Asian Highlands, we got the African grasslands almost entirely to ourselves. The giraffes and ostriches racing around, the quiet moments with the lions, and the sweet, curious baby cheetahs. The cheetahs are my new favorites, hands down ‚ô•Ô∏è. Even the gorillas were out and active (although they terrified Ev). We are so lucky to have this gem right here in our town.

This guy. This week marked 1 year since he went all in and started his own company. Thursday will be two years since we welcomed Ev into the world and made our family whole. And today it's been nine years since the day we got all dressed up, threw a big party and signed some paperwork making it "official." But here's the thing -- he'd still be my person all these years later even without that piece of paper. And I'm super lucky that I get to be his.

Me: "We shouldn't have too many clothes to sell in the garage sale; I've been selling them on BST sites." Also me: üòÆ . . . . But seriously, if you know anyone looking for baby clothes (mostly boy), baby toys, swaddles, etc -- we'll be here June 1 and June 2. We also have furniture. Home decor. Christmas decor (including a tree!). Probably a bunch of books, if I get around to it. And that's just our family -- there will be others.

This hasn't happened for months. So I'm acutely aware that it may be the last time my last baby falls asleep on my chest. And I'm so grateful she is growing and gaining independence but maybe crying a little, too. (ok, a lot) #momlife

I usually spend at least an hour painstakingly choosing my wrapping paper for the year. All of the rolls have to go together. It has to have cute tags and ribbon that fit the theme. In short ... it's kind of a big deal. This year, I let N take the lead. We were done in 5 minutes with pizza, tacos, hot chocolate and monsters. I don't hate it. Merry Christmas from the Homanns ü§∑

I often daydream of a time when these two are a little older and a little more self-sufficient. It would make this day full of of birthday breakfasts and zoo classes and family holidays a little less stressful. But then I open the door as we pull in at home and see this. And, just ... we're right where we need to be. And it's pretty great here.

One insisted on no clothes besides one blue sock, the other insisted on wearing and holding everything. Maybe these 2 are more alike than I realize. Stubborn. #16months
