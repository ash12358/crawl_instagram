Huge congrats on opening weekend, Jen. Let’s do this thing.

Kadota Figs aren't as cloying and rich as black figs and have much smaller seeds. They're a lovely pink inside. They're ripe when they're a yellowish green and slightly firm. About 15 percent of CA figs are Kadotas, and they grow on Ficus trees, which are apparently a kind of Mulberry. #taste1000fruits #lifelist

Bronx Grapes are a rare cross of Concord grapes and Thompson grapes, developed in NY in 1933. They're small, with a floral aftertaste, and the pinker ones have a honey-sweetness. Green ones are a slightly tart, lovely counterpoint. Their delicate skins make them difficult to ship, but there's one ranch in Northern California that has cuttings from the original vines. They're supposed to be seedless, but every fifth one you get a little crunch. #taste1000fruits #lifelist

The Kent Mango is a cross between Brooks and Haden mangoes that originated in South Florida in the 1930s. Super sweet with lots of meat and almost no fiber.

@yay.camille took my favorite family photo so far. Lovely things: Writing weather. Dogs that run at you and flop over on their backs for tummy rubs. The woman in a rainbow striped skirt, long orange sweater with moth holes up the back, and layers of yellow shirts emerges from her ocean-side  house, which is overgrown with succulents and her buoy collection.
