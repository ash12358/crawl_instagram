I see you mom in the splash pad at the park who‚Äôs kid is wearing underwear and not a swimming suit. . I see you and I understand you because my baby is simply wearing a diaper and that‚Äôs OK! . I see you and honor that you are trying to smile at everything your kid does even though I can tell you are tired. . I see you and relate to the anxiety you feel because you forgot to pack the water toys... but let‚Äôs be honest there‚Äôs always that epic mom that brings extra for others to share, so don‚Äôt worry! . I see you and I admire your strength because I have one child and sometimes I‚Äôm tired; but you have two and you are still present and letting them enjoy in a hot day. . I see you and want to tell you that it‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt smile every time, it‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt want to get wet with them and you just want to rest in the shade for a second and catch your breath. . I see you and honor you and want to tell you that your kids will be fine playing and discovering on their own. . I see you and want to celebrate that you accomplished being there for them. That you took the extra step to not care that you didn‚Äôt pack a swimming suit when you left the house. . I would encourage you if you wish to get wet with them once in a while just to feel the joy and the freedom they feel. . I see you sister and I thank you for the look you gifted me that acknowledged we are in this adventure together regardless of race, status or religion. . I see you and appreciate you for being! . Thank you! üòòüôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è . . . #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #consciousmom #consciousparenting #parenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #magnificentmama #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

One day she will not need me as much but for now I embrace her dependence. . As a parent sometimes it‚Äôs hard to realize a tiny person relies on you 24/7. . But it‚Äôs an honor to realize that someone needs you and loves you unconditionally. . After becoming a mom I realize that I kind of lost my identity and I‚Äôve learned to embrace a new version of myself. . It‚Äôs hard to understand that you have transformed and that you are no longer one person but are linked to another forever. . This feeling might happen with your life partner but never as real as a parent-child relationship. . Your child will need you a lot during their first years of life and this puts a pressure that might be difficult to assume. . The reality is that she is growing fast and one day she won‚Äôt look up to me with such intensity and that‚Äôs OK. . I look forward to her finding a stronger trust in herself. . I‚Äôm excited to see her grow. . I will always be there for her if she needs me but I will let her be, because she is her own self. . And I have to be my own self. . We are connected but are strong independently I‚Äôm sure of it. . I trust her and believe that she can do anything she wants if she puts her heart and soul into it. . I love you munchkin! . . . #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #familyportraits #holisticmoms #babiesofinstagram #toddlersofinstagram #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #consciousmom #consciousparenting #parenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #magnificentmama #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

One month off social media to detox and our baby girl has become a toddler who sleeps through the night. . She still wakes up a couple of times, but hey I will take it. . Grateful for being able to take time to focus on family and prioritize life. . Love you my little hero! . . . #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #familyportraits #holisticmoms #babiesofinstagram #toddlersofinstagram #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #consciousmom #consciousparenting #parenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #magnificentmama #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

Personal and emotional challenges are not easy with sleep deprivation. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve decided to take MAY as ‚ÄúSELF MONTH‚Äù. . Why focus on self you might ask? Well, since becoming a parent everything has shifted. I‚Äôve questioned everything from who I am, to what I do for work, or even how our society functions. . @drshefalitsabary says children are here as a gift to help us rediscover our true essence. I totally agree with this and yes Maya has reminded me of my inner child and taught me the importance of being mindful. . But while you transition to a better self you sometimes lose track of who you once were. . Especially when your baby cries ‚Äúmama‚Äù then you forget to focus on yourself and give everything to them. . It‚Äôs our responsibility as parents to awaken ourselves and to be the best we can be. But it‚Äôs also important to recognize red flags when we are not doing so well. . It‚Äôs been almost a year and a half of constant interrupted sleep. Some nights waking up every hour and not being able to go to sleep again. It‚Äôs taken a big toll both physically and mentally. . I understand how important it is to take time to focus on Maya‚Äôs sleep challenges while finding sanity and balance in our family life. . The only way Maya‚Äôs sleep will improve is if we have the energy to guide her through emotional swings through the night. We can only do this if we rest and regain energy throughout the day. . That‚Äôs why @pedramdara and I are taking this month as a healing one to go deeper into our stillness and peace. . Not only will this help Maya, but it will help us as individuals to be in a higher vibration with each other allowing our relationship to get even stronger and find clarity in other aspects of our lives. . As of May 1st I will not be active on social media nor will I respond to any messages, so if you want to keep in touch PM me before that and I‚Äôll gladly provide my personal email or phone number. . I will be sending all of you much love and good vibes. . See you soon! . Love you all! . . . #selfcare #consciousmom #consciousparenting #consciousliving #digitaldetox #socialmediasabbatical #deepthinking #innerpeace #minfulness

My current rainbow üåà involves kettlebells and colourful toys... . The kettlebells help me get stronger to be able to play with little Maya. . The wooden toys are eco friendly and non toxic so they don‚Äôt cause negative effects on her. . The truth is Maya likes the kettlebells more lol! . The lesson is babies don‚Äôt really need toys but we as parents need toys to awaken our inner child and learn to play again. . . . #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #familyportraits #holisticmoms #babiesofinstagram #toddlersofinstagram #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #consciousmom #consciousparenting #parenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #magnificentmama #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

Yesterday I was feeling ‚Äúmom guilt‚Äù for taking Maya to daycare. . But when I picked her up they had put a ponytail on her and she looked adorable. . It totally made my day! . Especially because I‚Äôve been sick and I wouldn‚Äôt of thought to do this... . I realize that as parents we worry about so many things, but in reality our little ones are stronger than we think. . Maya enjoys interacting with other little ones and it helps me as a mother to gain the strength I need to raise her. . In a perfect world daycare wouldn‚Äôt exist and we would live in communities where each parent helps out. . But for now I‚Äôm glad she is enjoying some fun times with a lovely lady and other kids for a few hours a day. . Love you munchkin! . . . #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #babiesofinstagram #toddlersofinstagram #kidsareourfuture #kidsarethefuture #kidsarethebestteachers #parenting

‚ÄúBe a rainbow in someone else‚Äôs cloud‚Äù by Maya Angelou. . Today I honor this wonderful quote by an epic soul because it‚Äôs a great reminder to hold space for others, no matter the age. . The other night Maya was crying and I remembered the power of sound vibration we practiced in Costa Rica. . So I started to Om. . I focused on holding space for her instead of stressing or trying to understand what was wrong with her. . I simply took a breath and then omed (if that‚Äôs even a word lol) . I focused on an epic night we experienced in Costa Rica, were @lisagrafos and her family did a healing sound bowl ceremony for Maya. . Even though I don‚Äôt have singing bowls yet, I tried replicating the vibration with my voice. . I let Maya cry in my arms. . But very fast her emotions shifted and she started singing Om as well! . Soon she fell asleep and I felt so at ease. . Sometimes as parents we think we can‚Äôt handle everything. . But we can! We simply have to remember we are the rainbow for our children. . We can enlighten them and provide comfort when their cloud is grey. . Sending you love fellow parents! . Let‚Äôs brighten our rainbow colors and spread light. .

Coming back to city life has been hard... . It made me think of how important it is to connect to nature. . We are lucky that Montreal has beautiful nature views! . Even though it definitely doesn‚Äôt look like spring here, it‚Äôs so clean an the air is pure. . Taking sometime to ground and reflect before our next adventure and gifts to the world! .

From the sunny jungle to a snowy city... . We‚Äôve been back for a week and it‚Äôs been hard adapting to city life. . Indoor life is definitely not the same than spending days in sunny nature! . Maya is integrating well and keeps our family positive. . Again she is our teacher showing us that in life you should love it all. . We are inspired by her development even now that we are back. . We got her a wooden walker and it took her one day to figure how to use it including turning at corners. . I‚Äôm confident that this time surrounded by epic humans in nature has affected her development greatly. . Thanks again my little one for teaching us that life is a constant learning experience. . That the places we go and the people we meet help us grow and evolve! . Love you my warrior princess! . . . #montreal #notspringyet #snow #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #familyportraits #holisticmoms #babiesofinstagram #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #parenting #consiousmom #consiousparenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

There is no time to be bored in a world as beautiful as this... . As I return to Montreal and see the photos from our trip I feel extremely grateful! . I mean just look at these two smiling! . This was one of our last days at a beautiful beach in Costa Rica called Pi√±uela beach. . We went early and the beach was empty. . Maya played on the sand, we swam in the ocean, drank coconut water and ate plantain chips. . It was a simple yet epic family day I will never forget! . We cherished the moment, we played and laughed. . It was amazing! . This is how family life should be! . Full of joy, love and adventure. . I want to make sure Maya keeps inspired like she did in Costa Rica and I think the key is play! . Her eyes light up when we play and let her be who she is supposed to be. . May she always remind us of the importance of living in the moment. . May she remind us to be ourselves and smile no matter what. . Love you both my superfam! . . . #junglegirl #costarica #nature #happylife #happyfamily #ocean #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #familyportraits #holisticmoms #babiesofinstagram #familyadventures #researcher #consciousfamilies #parenting #familylife #motherhood #momlife #mom #babylove #familylove #healthyliving #healthyfamily #healthylife #healthylifestyle

In Costa Rica she has slept in the most remote places. . She slept next to the fire. . Slept on me while partying at @envisionfestival . Slept on the road. . In fancy tents in the jungle. . On sarongs while people practiced yoga and meditation. . She slept on parks and beaches surrounded by loving people. . I‚Äôm sure she has had the most beautiful dreams. . May she continue to carry this magical energy. . May her dreams always be calm and sweet cheering up her heartbeat! .

The magical light in her eyes inspires everyone that interacts with her. . With one more week in our adventures in Costa Rica I wonder how this trip has influenced Maya. . I‚Äôm sure it has enlightened her. . She has grown so much and become her own self. . People tell us she is lucky to have us, but the truth is we are lucky to share this life with her. . I sat patiently today while feeding her next to the jungle and realized how important it is for parents to take our time with our little ones. . We sometimes forget to take time, to be present and not rush things. . Costa Rica has taught us the‚ÄùPura Vida‚Äù life... . A life of mindfulness, love, positivity and respect. . I know we will feel a shift when we go back to Canada. . But I‚Äôm committed to continuing to live this peaceful life. . I‚Äôm committed to inspire others to live a family focused life where children are included not separated. . I‚Äôm committed to providing Maya with the highest quality life experiences and education. . I‚Äôm grateful for her teachings. . I‚Äôm grateful she has brought the focus we needed to follow our purpose. . Thank you my baby girl. . I LOVE YOU! .

We just wrapped up a 17 day jungle experience with an epic group of humans in Costa Rica. . As I look back at these intense days I can‚Äôt stop thinking of the positive effect this has had on Maya. . Her development has intensified so much and her personality has never shined so bright. . It has been a hard journey to camp and travel with a 14 months old baby at @superheroacademy_net  @envisionfestival and exotic off grid locations! . But it has made me so much more grateful and provided a clear understanding of my life mission. . It has been inspiring to see individuals open up and tap into their inner child just by seeing Maya. . Her energy is so calm and pure that people see the potential of a better future for humanity in her. . Allowing conscious individuals to share their knowledge with her is essential for her to grow into an epic human. . As a parent I must always embrace new experiences so she can develop new skills. . This is why Pedram and I will be organizing family retreats based on all the knowledge we received in this journey, so stay tuned! . Thank you to every single individual that laughed with her, shared a smile and provided love towards her. . Thanks to everyone that acknowledged how challenging this adventure was. . Thanks for your feedback and your encouragement to inspire others to open up to the possibility of having a life with children were adventures don‚Äôt stop. . Thanks for your support and love! . I love you all! .

As a mom I try my best to stay positive. . I know the influence positivity will have on my daughter. . Some days it‚Äôs hard. . Especially when I‚Äôm tired or stuck inside the house because it‚Äôs too cold outside. . Yesterday we took Maya outside even though it was cold. . Not extremely cold of course! But cold nevertheless... . Some people would think that‚Äôs crazy! . But the air restored my body and provided some very needed extra energy. . In life we doubt if we should take the safe route and settle for normal. . I believe that normal is not good enough. . Yesterday it was a stroll on the snow but tomorrow it will be something else that will challenge me to live a better life. . To take risks. . I want to show my daughter to live better and overcome challenges. . To not be afraid of anything or anyone. . I want her to know that yes there will be challenging days and nights... . But that she should always see the bright side and keep positive! . I hope one day she will understand my craziness and laughs! . Love you munchkin. . . . #mindfulmaya #momlife #mommylovesyou #snow #winter #ergobaby360 #ergobaby #montreal #babycarrier #babywearing #babywear #happymom

Today I was asked what my resolutions for 2018 are... . I don‚Äôt believe in resolutions. . Instead we have a tradition that represents in adding one good habit and removing one bad habit. . This year I‚Äôm adding daily yoga and meditation as a habit. . I‚Äôm removing judgment of anyone and embracing love. . A good friend said his word for the year was ‚ÄúCOMPASSION‚Äù... . That‚Äôs exactly the word I‚Äôm embracing this year. . LOVE & COMPASSION .

I felt insecure about posting this before and after photo... . But especially since next week we're starting a new year, I want to share my transformation so other moms see what is possible. . It's not the first time I embark on a fitness journey. . But this is by far the most epic transformation I have experienced. . Before I thought fitness was only about losing weight and gaining muscles. . But after having a child and with all the challenges that represents I now know it's much more than that. . Fitness is about losing fear and surrendering. . About listening to what your body needs. . Sometimes things will come up and you will want to give up. . It's about understanding that failure is just an extra rock you have to climb to reach the top of the mountain. . I think most parents put excuses about fitness because it's easier. . I'm not judging those who decide that's their path, I simply want to tell them there is another way to live. . You can regain energy so you can be more present with your children. . You can feel more confident so you can raise confident children. . You can conquer your fears so that you can inspire your children to lose theirs. . You can do all this if you make health a priority. . I know it's hard but so worth it! . If you or a mom you know needs help regaining balance and gaining strength feel free to contact me. . I'm here to serve! . If you want to know the top secrets to transform into your best shape in 2018, check out my latest blog post (link in the bio): . https://www.onapraderas.com/transform-best-shape/ . I would like to thank those epic people that inspire me every single day! . Thank you for helping me reach a higher mental, physical and spiritual transformation! . I LOVE YOU ALL! . . . #fitmom #crossfit #healthymom #healthymama #strong #health #postpartumbody #postpartum #strongmom #fitness #strongereveryday #strongmoms #strongmomma  #healthylife #healthyeating #mindset

Last week was our 5 year wedding anniversary (9 year‚Äôs together) . A lot has happened since then and we have evolved so much. .

Many people don‚Äôt understand why we do the things we do. . But we do it all from our hearts. . 2017 was a year of awareness for us. . 2018 will mark our 10 year anniversary and we have epic plans to shift our lives! . We are here to change the world with our love. . So grateful to have you in my life @pedramdara . LOVE YOU!! . . . #weddinganniversary #happylife #healthyfamily #changingtheworld

All those sleepless nights and stressful moments are worth it to see her grow strong. . It amazes me how everyday she gets faster and stronger. . She is learning so fast it‚Äôs insane. . She is my greatest teacher, showing me everything is possible. . She lives fearlessly and everything she does comes from a place of love. . I wish we all could live like this. .

Two weeks from now Maya will turn one and I‚Äôve never been so lean and strong in my life! The day she was born I decided health and strength, both mental and physical was a non negotiable. I needed to be the best example for her and myself so she can grow confident. I did this by focusing on the bigger picture and understanding that I need to be stronger for when she needs to be carried when she gets sick or simply needs to feel safe. My secret to weight loss is simply eating non processed foods, no wheat, no dairy or sugar... yes I‚Äôve had some treats along the way. Once you put your mind to it, you can do it! After birth I started with simple mobility and yoga, then increased the complexity of workouts and finally moved to high intensity training! If you want to hear more about my transformation after having a child please msg me, I‚Äôd love to help you in yours! üòçüí™üèª‚ù§Ô∏è

She has toys but somehow she finds my water bottle more interesting.... We fool ourselves thinking our children need many toys but really all they need is a safe space to enhance their imagination! What games do you play with your little ones? #mommylovesyou #mindfulmaya

Maya hasn‚Äôt been feeling well since last week and has been depending (breastfeeding) on me 24/7... Today I had the choice to keep her home and not take her to daycare, but I know that I need to regain energy and strength. So I choose to rest because it‚Äôs the best thing I can do for my daughter... Sometimes we need to put ourselves first so we can be the best version for our children and that‚Äôs fine. I dream of a world where rest isn‚Äôt needed because there is enough community support from other parents that help raise our little ones! It takes a village to raise a child and I‚Äôm willing to create it! Who is with me? . . . #restisbest #timeforme  #healthymom #lovemyfamily #motherhood #parenting #parenthood

When most of the population is sleeping there is a small percentage of parents that are awake taking care of little ones. Making sure they feel better, comforting them so they feel safe and grow up feeling loved so they become confident, happy individuals that bring positivity to this world. Lately we have been part of these sleepless humans that put their energy into our daughters needs. As one of these individuals I ask that if you see a sleepy parent please, smile at them! Let them know they are not alone! That they are doing the best they can and that this matters for the future of humanity. Sending love and good vibes to moms and dads out there! . . . #parenthood #parenting #motherhood #whoneedssleep #mindfulmaya #mommylovesyou #daughter #love #trust #baby #babiesofinstagram #happy

4am play date... sometimes you just have to get up and let her play for a bit so she can fall asleep again. People ask me how I do it and the truth is I just do. Imagine if in life we were all driven by a stronger force that allowed us to do anything without questioning, regardless of the energy we have! Think about that for a second... #mommylovesyou #mindfulmaya #motherhood #parenting #parenthood #momlife

I‚Äôve been breastfeeding for almost a year and it hasn‚Äôt been easy. At three months #mindfulmaya had to be carried around while nursing and it was exhausting! The only thing that keeps me going is patience and positive thinking. No one tells you how hard breastfeeding will be and most importantly no one tells you it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt! We supplemented with organic formula at some point and that‚Äôs OK! If you are a new momma and are struggling I want to tell you, you are doing the best you can for your baby! You are awesome and your baby will love you regardless of what they drink! Sending love to all the moms out there. Cuddle your little one extra tight today! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüòò . . . #mommylovesyou #breastfeeding #motherhood #daughter #momlife #mama #motherhood #mamalove #love #baby #babies #babiesofinstagram

Today‚Äôs workout was epic @pedramdara and I broke some personal records! I never thought this could be possible especially after having a baby!!! Once you focus on health and strength something shifts in your brain. I‚Äôm grateful to share this journey with my love!

Today I didn‚Äôt sleep well as Maya woke up every two hours. The hubby took her to grandparents for a few hours. So I took a bath, then went downtown with the hubby and just walked. It‚Äôs incredible what a few hours of restoration can do. I feel more energized and positive, plus I got a new toque! The little things are what make us happy. Today I enjoyed a few solo hours with @pedramdara BTW he thinks I look like a teenager lol!

I used to have limiting beliefs about my weight and considered I would always have big hips and thighs. The truth is body transformation is linked to a shift in mindset. Diets are not the answer. Eating whole foods, consistent workouts and positive thinking are! The pijamas you see in this photo are from almost 10 years ago and I gave birth to my daughter Maya 10 month ago. I‚Äôve lost 10 kilos since her birth and have been eating non processed healthy meals plus a minimum of three high intensity training sessions a week. Don‚Äôt ever think it‚Äôs not possible, you have the power to transform your body, you can do anything you want! . . . #healthymom #fitness #minset #healthylifestyle #noexcuses #healthylife #fitmom #fitness

Today I celebrate @pedramdara for being an awesome dad and trying to cheer up little Maya. She had fever so we went to get her checked at the hospital. Apparently it's just a cold... she is still a bit low energy but still smiling like always! She is a super girl!

An hour later she finally fell asleep! Sleep training is one of the hardest things for a mom, especially if you are also getting your baby off breastfeeding... Yes, Maya is still using props to sleep but at least she is slowly learning how to do it on her own. I'm grateful for @pedramdara and his constant support in this emotional transition! I hope Maya understand we are doing this to help her be independent. We love you munchkin #mommylovesyou #mindfulmaya #babiesofinstagram

Little Maya is teething and was in pain most of the night so the family didn't sleep much. We still embraced our day with positivity and love because that's what being a family means to us.

This photo by @allisamazing was taken at a Ibiza while attending @afestbymindvalley It was the first time I wore a bikini 5 months after having Maya. It was scary to show my body but at the same time liberating. I'm still in the process of getting fit and strong but I'm posting this for Maya. May she always feel confident with her body at any point in time! LOVE YOURSELF ALWAYS! #mommylovesyou #mindfulmaya

As some of you may have noticed I haven't been posting daily drawings lately. That's because I attended @afestbymindvalley and am enrolled in a one-month intensive learning journey in Barcelona lead by @mindvalley and a lot has happened in the last few weeks. I've had the realization that I must follow a higher purpose of education and personal growth in order to serve others better. I have decided to end my daily drawing project and pursue a more mindful creative process that brings more value to the world. I will still post positive drawings to keep positivity alive in the world, just not as a daily basis. I am excited to start a more focused creative journey, stay tuned for new announcements.
