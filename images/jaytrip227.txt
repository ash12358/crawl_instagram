“Most smiles are started by another smile.” — Frank A. Clark * * We make each other smile. We try not to worry. He understands that anything is possible as long as we continue to fight and do what is necessary. I’m happy to instill values that enable us to smile during our storms as a team... near or far. He is my heart ❤️❤️❤️

Special Request: My entire life story has been one of overcoming. This situation is no different. I believe I am already healed therefore I need you all to believe that with me. My son is covered and protected. I came into this world on faith and I continue to live on that same faith. * * Let’s pray that I continue to have the courage to live in my purpose and continue to share myself in a way that inspires. I did not go through so much gunk in my life to keep it to myself. It needs to be released so others can begin their own healing process. This is the phase of my purpose I know the universe wants me to step in. * * I do not believe we conquer adversities to keep our triumphs and our truths to ourselves. Whether it be through more children’s books, personal essays, videos, or helping other people share their story—my purpose is to help the world (even just a small portion of it) see that they too can overcome and are worthy of what life holds for them. * * Thank you all for the continued prayers. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Cheers to health, happiness, and living in purpose! 💖💖💖

I’ve been in the hospital for three weeks now. I was losing my life, and while it was a scary experience I chose faith over fear. Doctors are telling me I’m supernatural and I’m causing them to think through all the rare complexities of my case. But, I’m a fighter. In any case, here are some words of encouragement I’d like to share for your own life. Full video is on my Facebook.

#MaliaTheMerfairy is crossing racial lines! I will admit that I am surprised, but I’m finding there are non-black parents that want to expose their children to diverse content. This particular parent thanked me because she said the only thing mainstream that contained the diversity she wanted for her young daughter was Dr. McStuffins 🧜🏽‍♀️🧚🏽‍♂️✨💫✨💫✨💫 • • #Diversity #BlackExcellence #childrensbooks

“The sisters and brothers that you meet give you the materials which your character uses to build itself. It is said that some people are born great, others achieve it, some have it thrust upon them. In truth, the ways in which your character is built have to do with all three of those. Those around you, those you choose, and those who choose you.” — Maya Angelou • • This pretty much sums up my day from the time I picked @bree.newsome up from the airport to the time I dropped her off yesterday.

It’s been awhile since I’ve been in a cap and gown. I’m the designated name reader in addition to being part of Senior Leadership 🙂 It’s an honor to wear the regalia for @hu_gradschool Class of 2018 Honors and Recognition Ceremony tomorrow. Now I only need to figure out how I’m gonna get the cap to fit with these curls. Lol #HU18 #HowardU #HUGradSchool #HBCUPride #BlackExcellence

I’m constantly having to slow myself down so I can work on other things important to ME. Not everything is a fire. And, if you allow it, people-places-things will have you thinking that their demands are greater than your own. I learned that if you keep acting that way, you will eventually burn yourself out. Being passionate includes self-care so that your passion has longevity. • • “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

Throwback Thursday! 1986: 1st grade. And, I used to get in trouble for trying to rush other students along through their class work. I would speed through mine cause I caught on quickly. This was also the year I discovered ripping off the bad note from the teacher about me “talking.” I was eating the paper so my parents wouldn’t find out. Apparently, I was eating some of the good ones too and didn’t know it cause I couldn’t read cursive yet. Some kids ate glue, some ate crayons, my vice was the paper. 🤣🤣🤣

Throwback Thursday! Back when I was advisor to @iup.naacp we needed to get the attention of the University as a whole on a racial issue. In 2004, A group of white students formed a #Facebook group called “Niggaz on Welfare.” Yes, there were all white students in this group. 2004 was also the year FB launched for college students nationwide. You think FB has privacy issues, they sure did back then. • • In any case, I created this flyer so we could get things stirred up and the various issues addressed. We plastered these in fluorescent flyers across campus and the outrage was one that I felt like I was living back in the 60s. Members of the executive board and myself were even followed in vehicles on occasion. We had to create a safe buddy system because we kept posting the flyers back up every time they were torn down. Because of the outrage of this flyer, we drew over 600 people out to this meeting. • • Now, aside from raising awareness, we 1) We got the administration to create a user policy for university owned email addresses 2) Created an alliance board with other black organizations across the PA Higher Education System 3) University creates a new position for diversity affairs 4) We got Facebook to take down the group despite their policy of “free speech.” 5) Increased and diversified IUP NAACP membership base after telling our story. • • I could go on and on. But, this situation right here was one that made me realize the power of this new social networking site. I began looking at these sites as another way of communicating and married them with the traditional means. • • Communications is powerful 💥

Today marks the 50th Anniversary since the unfortunate assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Kiddo and I had a great conversation when we visited the monument on Sunday.

Because the kiddo has my DNA through and through, he is naturally curious about things that affect his community. As he matures, his curiosity will grow into coming up with solutions. @howard1867 is a big part of our lives now and he is in love with it. I took him to see the student sit-in today and yesterday he wrote an acrostic poem. We love Howard and he is supportive of the role I have taken on here.

Tonight was Literacy Night at the Kiddo’s School. End of Year 2nd grade goal is Level M books and he’s already there. They sent us to the “big kids” side to get materials to help him excel more at his level at home. We started going through the 3rd grade word list tonight and he didn’t start having issues until Week 10. • • I’m so proud of him. We discuss operating in excellence just about every day no matter what kind of challenges we face. Kiddo has a solid foundation and I’m excited to see how he will build upon it. 🖤✨💫✨💫✨💫

In case you missed it: New photo of Harriet Tubman emerges. Her age is estimated to be between 43-46. • "What's remarkable about this photograph is that she's so proud and dignified and beautiful. She looks so young," Dr. Kate Clifford Larson said. "This is the vibrant young Tubman just coming off her work during the Civil War. She's building her life with her family." • Dr. Larson, author of the biography "Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero,"

Welcome to 1994—A great year in music, TV, movies and culture. Not to mention this was the year OJ Simpson led the police on a chase up the California Interstate. Wonder what he was listening to? 🤔🤔🤔 • Other culture shifting events included the Rwandan Genocide (depicted in the movie Hotel Rwanda), Nelson Mandela became the first South African President of the post-apartheid era (ending three centuries of white era), and Byron De La Beckwith Jr.—the man who assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers—was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. • #fortheculture #blackhistory #blackexcellence #worldhistory

“Whatcha gonna do when God comes?” —Craig Mack • Craig Mack died of heart failure at the age of 46 yesterday. He is best known for his track “Flava In Ya Ear” and is deemed by @diddy as part of the foundation that built his Bad Boy Record Label in the 90s. • “Diddy declared both Biggie Smalls and Mack the foundation of Bad Boy Entertainment. “This is my life here,” Diddy said, gesturing to Mack and Biggie Smalls during an interview with MTV Raps. “We all need each other to live and breathe.

#MyShero Ida B. Wells: An international leader in anti racist, anti lynching awareness. She was co-founder of NAACP in the midst of her writings and campaigns. Not to mention her skill in Communications and journalism as a way to bring awareness and exemplify leadership. The New York Times recently resurfaced her story and gave her (and several other women) proper obituaries. I’m happy about that. Ida B. Wells was bad ass. 🖤✨💫✨💫✨💫

Yesterday, kiddo and I went to an awesome panel discussion at the Oprah Winfrey Theatre in @nmaahc. I asked a question based off my experience in a college where they had to change the mascot twice during my time there. The discussion by Dr. Ibram X Kendi was insightful. And, Bree Newsome (the woman that climbed the flagpole to remove the confederate flag at SC state house grounds in 2015) told her story. I learned a new piece to her truth that went unreported.  And of course we spent time in the reflection room. The kiddo had so many questions afterward. I love our conversations after these events 🖤✨💫✨💫✨💫

“I am a deserved soul.” I’ve been saying this mantra of mine for quite some time now. But, I can say that on my 38th birthday—I wholeheartedly believe it and embrace it. So over the course of MY new year, I will begin releasing some of my most intimate parts of me...my very personal writings. It’s time to stop hoarding the very things that will help someone somewhere and possibly help others navigate through this thing called life. Don’t fear if the tone of my posts seem “different”—I’m not depressed—I’m in an excellent place—it’s just me releasing the baggage sitting in the dusty corners of my soul. Cheers to my growth, my happiness, and my path ahead. #HappyBirthdayToMe

Only 11% of children’s books have contained multicultural content over about 23 YEARS. Only 6% of children’s book authors are Black, Latino and Native American. Imagine how much less that percentage is for Blacks. And someone had the nerve to question why I’m doing children’s literature. Activism takes shape in various forms. Oh, and did I mention that my illustrator is a young woman of color. That was important to me 🤷🏽‍♀️

The essence of human life is our spirit. Positive spirits should attract positive things. Negative spirits will attract negative things. Let’s take it back to basic math addition: Two positives make a positive. Two negatives make a negative. Too much negativity keeps things negative. Too much positivity keeps things positive. May your circle (and relationships at every level) always be at a positive (#rp @blackloverules 🖤✨💫)

The kiddo ditched me this year for his first crush. He was so nervous giving this to her. Everyone else in his class got a lollipop, but he went out his way to make her a card. He told me she was happy and she said yes. He also said that it made him feel good because she is very nice and not mean like other girls that make fun of him. Lol! He proceeded to probe about whether or not a “good guy” told me he wanted me for his Valentine. Told him that was “my grown up business.” He thinks imma be an old cat woman 😒😂😂

#AboutLastNight I met one of my mentors for the first time: Nikki Giovanni. All I could say to her was “I love you. I...LOVE...YOU. Thank you for everything.” It was so emotional for me y’all. You know, having a toxic, unloving mother and lacking in positive female mentors in my family that took me under their wings (aunties, cousins, sisters)...I immersed myself in reading and writing. Nikki has always been one of those “mentors I never met” until last night. She even told me I need to publish my book of poetry (that she signed for me too). You’ll have to go to my FB to see my full out 6 minute video recap (😩😩😩). Meeting her was so very special.

#JamieHistory 1989 was the year I tested at gifted levels in reading and language arts (was 76% higher in math than third graders across the nation compared to reading 96% and language arts 91% higher). Unfortunately, they had met their “affirmative action quota” for children of color in the gifted program and refused to officially test me (no lie). It wasn’t until 93-94 that a couple Middle School teachers of mine served as my advocate with the guidance counselor. They enrolled me in three honors classes to “test me out.” By high school I was finally properly placed in all honors classes. #RacismInEducation #MyBlackHistory

#ThrowbackThursday One of my Uncle’s always called me “Margaret” because he said I looked like their mother, my paternal grandmother. Sometimes I had a hard time seeing it until I took this picture. For some reason I just seen her eyes all in mine. I even have her slight lazy eye. My dad told me I carried a lot of her mannerisms too. I mean, this is a woman that slapped a little white boy in the face for spitting on her and she got away with it back in the day. I always wished I had the opportunity to meet her but I guess I’m looking right at her every day.

Aaliyah would have been 39 years old yesterday. Hard to believe she passed away when we both were only 21/22. She released this song when I was still in college. You couldn’t tell me that me and my girls didn’t have any of this choreography down 😂😂😂 This was the final album she had the chance to record and it is on my list of favorite albums. #happybirthdayaaliyah #fortheculture

The kiddo and I had the opportunity to hear Rev. Jeremiah Wright (President Obama’s Pastor) speak today in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. “The oppressor’s God is not our God.” The message left me so full! Wish you could have seen a predominately black congregation of at least 1000 people taking a knee in prayer to reaffirm their commitment to racial justice and racial equality. These type of things are not in the media! A bonus of today was Richard Smallwood surprising the congregation with an appearance and performing Total Praise with the Howard Gospel Choir (which he founded in 1969 while attending Howard). It is well with my soul 🖤✨💫✨💫✨💫

Throwback Thursday! Four years ago, I had an opportunity to meet Rev. Jesse Jackson. It wasn’t all his politics that had me excited to meet him (my perspective had changed on some things as an adult)—but I had told my dad as a little 8/9 year old girl watching the news that I would meet Rev. Jackson when I “grew up.” Fast forward, after speaking with him at this particular event, Rev. Jackson pulled me to the side to tell me to keep up the great work with the kiddo. He went and sat down with the choir (Ebenezer A.M.E. Church Choir). Then he waved the kiddo over to be included. Not only did part of my vision come to pass, but my son has another piece for his legacy book.

Happy Kwanzaa! "Kwanzaa was created to introduce and reinforce seven basic values of African culture which contribute to building and reinforcing family, community and culture among African American people as well as Africans throughout the world African community. These values are called the Nguzo Saba which in Swahili means the Seven Principles. Developed by Dr. Karenga, the Nguzo Saba stand at the heart of the origin and meaning of Kwanzaa, for it is these values which are not only the building blocks for community but also serve to reinforce and enhance them." www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org

#ThrowbackThursday Back to my old high school paper—Trojan Times! I started writing for it in 1995. I fought hard to get something about Black History published. Many of my classmates never knew of the “fight” I had with administration and our faculty advisor on these things. Prior to, the FA got some heat because I wrote and article about how pocket chains (think 90s grunge) were not a violation of the student code of conduct (students were being told they couldn’t wear them). In any case, anything I wrote had to be “approved” by the administration for publication after that. In 1997, they finally agreed to publish my article about black history. This was around the same time me and a few other black students fought to have my high school’s first black history month Program. The following year I was made an editor-in-chief. I found out later I had to share the position because of issues I had with the administration (At one point I was even threatened with expulsion over the things I was writing). But, that didn’t stop me from turning a one page article to a three page layout about black history. And because we lacked black students in the journalism program, white students were forced out of their comfort zone to research on the part of history we weren’t taught in the curriculum. I would then move on to my college paper The Penn where I became Copyeditor (third in command and the first black person to hold an editorial leadership role from what I was told by the co-op board)—Yep, I “colorized” the college paper as well. Making sure black organizations on campus were written about. I have ALWAYS used my skills with communications for the betterment of my people. Many think leading change means you have to be front and center in the public eye. It may not be as glamorous , but the “fight” behind the scenes is soooooooo important. I found these papers and it just made me feel proud about the “unseen” things I was able to accomplish.

Don’t just raise standards you put on other people, places, and things—but how can you raise standards to hold YOURSELF accountable? #BossUp ✨💫✨💫✨💫

#longpostwarning A week from today, I’ll be transitioning into a new career opportunity at Howard University. I was offered the role of Communications and Development Coordinator in the Graduate School last Friday. This is a HUGE milestone for me in my career/life. I am beyond thrilled to finally be able to be in the position to help strengthen one of the greatest institutions for our people without having to tiptoe after work hours to fight for our people. Someone over the weekend asked—What is your key to success? Me: Other than hard work, determination, perseverance, I have had to stay true to the calling that has been placed on my life.” You see, this Communications thing isn’t something I just woke up one day and decided to do. And, my activist work with race relations and fight against racism isn’t something I started doing because it was a trending topic. These are natural gifts that I’ve been using for the greater good for at least 25 years. I made a commitment to each as a pre-teen growing up in Johnstown, PA and just decide to stick to it no matter what. I always get so emotional with each level up because getting “here” has been extremely challenging and many people have doubted, underestimated, blocked me—yet, I am in constant awe with the way God and the universe orchestrates to make what you thought might not ever happen...happen! Nothing will ever stop the heavens from your destiny as long as you continue to live in your purpose and truth. Keep goin, because my entire life thus far is testimony that there’s so much more in store for you too ✨💫✨💫✨💫

“I always feel like it's two key ingredients when it comes to following your dreams, making something happen that the average person deems difficult. If you truly believe it, that's step one. Step two, is, you know, the hard work that goes along with it.” —J.Cole
