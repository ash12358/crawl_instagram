I woke up at 4:45am this morning to shoot with the fantabulous @tatianasidorova16 and we had a blast. She even insisted on going in the lake to take a few shots... Tatiana and I met at Photoshop World, she modeled in my booth and we became friends since then. There’s no question why she is Miss Congeniality. She’s a blast to be around. These are a few Straight out Camera shots we got today. I cannot wait to play with these pics! Thank you @didi_0824 for being an awesome assistant 😘 #gilmarsmithphotography

Honored to be photographed by the AMAZING @samhaddixphoto Duuuude I absolutely LOVE this shot and geez the toning, gosh! AMAZING! Thank you so much! Your work blows me away! #Repost @samhaddixphoto with @get_repost ・・・ Honestly, it’s intimidating photographing someone like @gilmarsmith . Sure, she’s one of the nicest, loveliest, most easy going people I’ve ever met - but she’s also an outrageously talented photographer who is infinitely more creative than I could ever hope to be. Regardless, she’s one of my favorite people, and I was absolutely honored to take her portrait.

Find you a grumpy friend that takes you on an adventure! A couple of weeks ago @capturewithdave dragged me on adventure he decided to call #MiamiMonday.

FATE. Many years ago when I joined G+ I used to play a Photography Scavenger Hunt with a bunch of other photographers who ended up becoming dear friends and my pilar of support when I needed it the most. I recently went back there to play again and made this picture for the word “Fate”. I just found out I won a 1st Place, a 2nd Place and a honorable mention from each of the judges. No matter how hectic life can get, always find time to play! 💛 #gilmarsmithphotography

*NOT MY PICTURE*  a few weeks ago @kirkmarshphotography came over to hangout. I know some of you remember clearly because I got a few messages commenting on Kirk’s glorious abs when I posted a BTS on my stories. So after he took and destroyed some of my home decor stuff to take a self portrait, this is the awesome result! Go give the guy a follow. He doesn’t have any 😂🤣😂 #Repost @kirkmarshphotography with @get_repost ・・・ Make portraits anywhere with anything. Just make something. Several weeks ago I was hanging out with @gilmarsmith in her studio and we found some random objects to play with on her countertop. I love creating pieces that are spontaneous and situational and using some creativity to make new worlds. #newworlds #visual_creatorz #thegraphicsproject #theportraitproject #graphicdesign #manipulationclan #global_visuals #agameoftones #fncreation #photomanipulation #compositeworld #fantasyart #fantasy

Sometimes I feel I’m losing my head... Even though I feel blessed to be busy doing the things I love, stress is really messing with my head and body. I’ve felt a little off in the last couple of days, sleep is pretty much nonexistent. I found the dishwasher soap in the fridge, the roku remote was lost for a few days and found it in the car... you know those little things that makes you realize you need to take a break for a bit and breath. I’m super excited about all the projects I’m working on and I cannot wait to show you pretty soon. Somebody asked me recently how do I look when I just wake up. This picture pretty much is it. 💁🏻‍♀️

Two weeks ago after finishing editing I restarted my computer and went to sleep. To my surprise,the next day I woke up to a screen stuck on the Apple Logo and the loading bar. I tried everything and my computer wouldn’t start. I panicked and yes, I cried. There were a few things that weren’t backed up... yes, I know, dumb! 🤦🏻‍♀️ So, after two weeks without my computer, I finally got it to work. I’m still recovering data from the old hard drive but I’m so behind everything. Gotta write a few articles and tutorials, gotta do a bunch of editing. So please, today take a minute and backup all of your data. Brushes, actions, textures included.... 😭

My mom has been with me for the last couple of months helping me with my move and my kiddos. No matter how badass and independent I consider myself it’s been a blessing having my mom at home. The last two years have been very rough and having the chance to delegate a few things have been amazing for my mental health. I’m so sad she has to leave in two weeks. I really need to clon myself.... #portraits_mf #portraitvision #portraitmood #portraitpage #endlessfaces #portrait_vision #portraitfestival #portraitgames #pr0ject_uno #theportraitpr0ject #ig.portraits #earth_portraits #featurecollective #pursuitofportraits #theportraitculture #smugmug #kelbyone #portrait #portraitkiller #discoverportraits #portraitsquad #portraitmag #creativeportraits #featurecollective #portraitsedition #theportraitcentral

When I shared yesterday my Snow White dress makeover, somebody told me “that dress would make a great Queen of Hearts” to which I replied “Challenge Accepted”. I’m still working on it and it’s far from being done. I just wanted to share what I’ve been up to tonight. How’s your Friday night going?  I need a break, my eyes are fried! #beforeandafter #queenofhearts #photoshop #gilmarsmithphotography

I’ve been really stressed out the last few days. Last night I sat in front of the computer  because, you know, insomnia, and decided to turn my daughter into Snow White for a composite. Norah asked me last night about her dad. I thought I had a couple of years before she asked, she was pretty serious about it. She caught me off guard and I didn’t know what to say. How do you explain a little girl that just turned 3 about death? So after I put her in bed I went to my happy place, Photoshop, and started playing with this. I still have a lot to do to it but it’s getting somewhere. What do you do to fight stress and anxiety? What’s your Happy place? #snowwhite #beforeandafter #photoshop

Happy birthday to my beautiful girl! You came to our lives to fill it with love and laughter. You're a immense force of energy that keeps me on my feet everyday. You have put a smile on our faces in the saddest and darkest days. Your brother and I are so lucky to have you! 💖 I planned all kind of surprises for my little girl today. But we ended up welcoming her birthday last night in the ER. We're back home. Everybody is ok. She just opened her presents and is having a great time. I guess we're just going to take it easy today...

Who says that my dreams have to stay just my dreams. -Ariel My beautiful and super talented underwater photographer friend @erikathornes asked me to collaborate with her editing one of her awesome shots about two weeks ago. She wanted to go with "The Little Mermaid" theme, and the Disney freak in me squealed so loud 😱 Thank you Erika for giving me the chance to create magic together! I really enjoyed applying a little pixie dust to your already magical picture.

Get off the phone, dad! I had a blast last Thursday shooting with @otownchad. Chad contacted me a few weeks ago asking me if I would like to mentor him. We are having a lot of fun in the process. If you want to learn how to take and process fun pics of your kids don't hesitate to contact me!

14 years ago I packed my bags and left my beautiful Venezuela behind wishing one day I could go back. Little I knew how bad things would turn in my beautiful country. Today, I wish one day I could take my kids to it's beautiful beaches, to see it's beautiful waterfalls, to run free as my cousins and I used to. Today, that's just a dream. Venezuelans are living and economical catastrophe. Lack of food, the murder rate is one of the highest in the world, and sadly the rising generation had no choice but to leave the country looking for better opportunities, leaving everything behind. My dad, once a very successful civil engineer told me last night on the phone, he had to stay for hours in a line to buy two loafs of bread and that's, if you're lucky! Still far away, but my heart is always there, hoping better days will come. 💛💙❤️ 🇻🇪 #venezolana #venezuela #venezuelatengoentimisilusiones
