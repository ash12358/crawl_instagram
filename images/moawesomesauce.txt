SUSHI 🍥🍣 I never really embraced the mad love for #sushi that people have. But slowly, I've come to appreciate the variety, the tastes and the experience behind some of the amazing sushi dishes that I have had. And @sumosushibentoqatar has been one of those place where I was pleasantly surprised at what they had to offer. A big thank you to @foodsheikha_qtr and @whatsupdoha for introducing me to them. Have you tried out their food yet? . . . . . #japanesefood #chopsticks #sumosushibento #foodie #foodiegram #letseat #moawesomesauce #sushiroll #musttry #doha #dohafoodies

ASIAN FIESTA 🍲 If you are a fan of Indonesian, Malaysian or Filipino food, @snackhouseak is where you need to be. The drive to Al Khor to just have this food might sound crazy to you BUT once you get there and dig in, you'll forget all about that dreary drive. Thanks to @zakiarmen, one of the co-founders, a couple of friends and I had a ball of a time here, when he treated us to some of the specialities available. You can check my stories highlight for more about it. Located inside Logic Food Center, on the 1st floor food court. If you ever try it out, do let me know your thoughts. PS: they will be opening up inside Doha soon. . . . . . #asianfood #malaysian #filipino #indonesian #bbqchicken #rendang #doha #musttry #eeeeeats #boodlefight #foodieadventures #foodiegram #moawesomesauce #tbt #throwbackthursday #throwback

LAMB CHOPS 😍 Ever had a yummy serving of #lambchops which tasted as good as it looks? That's exactly what I experienced @jamiesitaliangcc. The Dish: Lamb Chops Scottadito (EN: Burned Fingers) served on a bed of amazing Agrodolce Peppers (that stuff is the 💣) and a generous helping of Salsa Verde (which makes all the difference). If you ever plan on dining here, you might not wanna miss this one.

HUDA 👩 Came in our lives on this day, in the wee hours of the morning, in 2009. Changed our lives forever. Taught us what it truly was, to be young parents (read "sleepless nights"). Was the little ray of sunshine for the whole family, as the first girl child of the 3rd gen. Today, she's a lovely girl, turning 9 and still keeps @fawadbest on her toes.

LETS TACO ABOUT IT! 🌮 #TacoTuesday has been kicked up a notch @dohamarriott with the launch of their new menu at #Salsa Restaurant, curated by @wmexicocity's Chef Efraín. You can always have the fresh guacamole and chips. But some of the more exciting dishes are the Prawn Ceviche, Beef Short Ribs and the bomb-on-your-palate Chilli Chocolate Cake. These 📸 don't do justice, cuz these are only samples. You get the real deal, when you dine-in proper. . . . Who wants to try it?

DELICIOUS 🍔 So sometime during #Ramadan, I headed out to this new café that had opened up in the neighborhood. Petite little place, well decorated (that cup wall is epic) and good enough for a quick coffee & sandwich kind of place. Got introduced to what they have on the menu, what's coming up after Ramadan and some of their unique menu items. And this one, the Chicken Khudu, was something that I enjoyed very much. They also got some tasty burgers and a wide range of drinks & desserts. Try it out and lemme know what you guys think.

Westin Doha Arabian Bazaar: THE FOOD Browsing through 18 different live stations, I can assure you, I did not know what I wanted to try first. The pictures here are only a few of the items I was able to capture (before I got hungry). My highlight of their food was the Mexican Station serving Prawn Tacos and the Indian Station which had an amazing Prawn dish (clearly I love my prawns).

This year, the Almas #Ramadan tent by @ccrotanadoha may have toned down on their decorations but the same great food is still available. Thanks to their invitation, I got a chance to check out what they had to offer. Great selection of food (loved their Prawn Masala), live stations for sushi & shwarma and a fabulous desert station with fresh crepes & ice cream! Have any of you tried it yet?

Earlier this week, I got the opportunity to check out the lovely setup by @frasersuitesdoha for #Ramadan2018.

The @hidohabp #Ramadan2018 setup - one of the newest tents in the hood and the first tent at the new hotel.

Took a look at what @icdohathecity has setup for #Ramadan2018, a few days ago. A complete change from their previous years, this year they have set up a sprawling spread at The Square. Iftar is offered as a buffet for 180 QR per person while Suhoor will be available a-la-carte. If you need your dose of shisha, then you can opt to dine at Al Jalsa Garden Lounge where Iftar and Suhoor will both be served a-la-carte. Who else is looking forward to #Ramadan this year? #foodiegram #intercontinental #eatingout #foodstagram #dohalife #lifeinqatar

On a spontaneous need for some good food, we headed out to check out @streetfoodrepubliclk. Ordered their Steak & Fries, Hot Butter Cuttlefish, Chicken Sub and Roti Canai with Chicken Curry. Those Steak & Fries came with an epic pesto sauce, which I wish I could have, each time I have a steak. Though they could have improved on the fries. Hot Butter Cuttlefish came with a fried rice, for obvious reasons. Chicken Sub was alright, nothing fancy. The chicken curry for the Roti Canai was one spicy delight (wanted to take some home too). Final Thoughts: would love to try more of their dishes. Wasn't too expensive either. Go try it out! #streetfood #yummyfood #steak #malaysian #nightout #vacation #srilanka #islandlife #exploresrilanka #foodie #foodporn #foodiegram #foodgasm #lka

Better Than Kayefcee IOW Crispy Chicken Tenders 🍗🍴 I love how @caramelpumpkin.lk has put in some serious creativity in building their menu! Definitely worth checking out, if you're in #Colombo.

I've got a long list of places to try out this time around, in 🇱🇰. First off, it was @cafenoir.srilanka for lunch. Great looking place, conveniently located in Col-05. We tried the Grilled Chicken (1), which came with a Creamy Mushroom Sauce and Mashed Sweet Potatoes, the Honey Glazed Grilled Chicken (2) with Sweet Potato Chips, and a round of Sweet Potato Fries and Cheese Toast (4) with Kochchi (a very spicy 🌶). The mashed potato, being slightly spicy, was epic and complimented the dish well. The chicken could have been slightly more tender though. Everything else was fairly up to expectations. Service could improve, as they brought in the appetizers and main dishes but got late with the platter that we ordered for the kids. Then there were the annoying flies, which I wish they could have done something about. #lunch #latergram #foodiegram #travelsrilanka #islandlife #foodieadventure #chicken #sweetpotato #🇱🇰

My experiments in the kitchen are forever a learning experience and thanks to awesome friends, I can fix my mistakes. I'm not perfect, nobody is. If you're willing to learn, then your path to perfection is bound to be smooth. These muffins were delicious but they lacked softness. And a Turkish friend (who runs a baking business) was the one who said that I needed to let it sit in the tray for some time before I pop in the oven, so the baking powder can do it's magic (which I didn't know). #kitchenexperiments #chefinthemaking #bakingtime #chocolatemuffin #chocolate #yummyinmytummy #lifelessons #ilovebaking

#KopiKade meets #Awesomesauce. Checked out this 3rd wave #Coffee place & instantly fell in ❤️ with it. They've got amazing coffee and very unique dishes in a minimalist & elegantly designed interior. Plus you're definitely in for a great conversation with the man who runs the show, if you love coffee as much as he does.

Happiness - we wish we were surrounded by it but the harsh reality of achieving it, is mind-blowing.

As kids from the 80's, having fun included the great outdoors, including climbing trees. I decided to get both my kids to experience what it feels like to be climbing trees and enjoying nature. And the best part for them was jumping down from it.
