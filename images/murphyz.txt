Tsunami - Eastbourne, England I spent a few days on the south coast of England this week with @jimnix and @esslingerphoto and had some great pre-sunset clouds forming over the pier in Eastbourne. I thought these ones in particular looked like a giant wave about to crash into the pier, and what with it being so empty I wondered if everyone else had received some sort of warning apart from us. Great to be out shooting with the camera again, it’s been too long. #eastbourne #pier #weather #stormy #clouds #tsunami #southcoast #thisisengland #visitengland

Stary Browar - Poznan, Poland This shopping mall was closed for a national holiday when we visited it and the security guy who we attempted to speak with ('attempted' as we didn't share a common language) was certainly refusing our request to enter and take photos. Luckily the cinema was open that day, so we were able to enter the building via that entrance and have the place to ourselves. A place this vast is odd when you have nobody else in view, but lovely to have no one else in the images. Security found us before long and evicted us from the premises, but it was nice for the short time it lasted. #poland #escalators #symmetricalmonsters #agameoftones #symmetry #empty #stairsandsteps #staircases #shoppingmall

Day 1 in Warsaw and we had the pleasure of seeing a lovely staircase.  The building where I thought it was looked completely shut for the weekend, but a door automatically opened as we walked past it and the nice security guy who was inside said we could have 5 minutes to shoot it.

Fighting fire with ice cream - Granary Square, London I'm not a huge fan of the festive season, but am quite taken by this work by @alexchinneck currently in place at Granary Square.  When I walk past it in the morning it's merely a giant ice cube that you can't really see through, but on my way home in the evening it is transformed and you can glimpse a Christmas tree on the inside.  This is a closeup shot, but I recommend you check it out in person to see it in full. #christmas #tree #london #granarysquare #art #kingscross

Waterfall - Sappada, Italy Poor weather towards the end of the trip meant we settled for a few waterfalls instead of an epic sunset scene...but I love a waterfall so am rather happy.  No need to hike to get to it either which is a bonus, as I can be lazy sometimes. #waterfall #italy #iphoneonly #dolomites #blackandwhite #longexposure

Autumnal - Arabba, Italy Sometimes the best landscapes unfold before you with no planning required, which is what happened here.  After a morning hike to get to a nice location for sunrise, and after reviving ourselves with a lovely warm beverage, we decided to head into Austria to fill the car up with fuel as it's much cheaper there.  Driving along, we suddenly saw this scene, and the light decided it will play along and provide us with one of my favourite scenes of the trip.

Tree fog - Sappada, Italy The rain came in today, so @esslingerphoto and I donned our waterproof gear and went for a hike around the area of Sappada where we're staying armed only with our smartphones. Just near the back of the house we found a lovely little waterfall trail, a great location during the rain; the trees and surrounding hills looked awesome.

Laghi D'Olbe - Dolomites, Italy Quite near to where we're staying is a lovely hike up to a couple of lakes. @esslingerphoto, @slawek.uk and I were treated to spectacular views on the way up as the mist wove in and out of the valleys, and we were then able to enjoy a great sunset with nobody else around.

Haldarsvík view - Faroe Islands A short hike up from the picturesque village of Haldarsvík are a couple of nice looking waterfalls, but when you turn around your faces with this view that I find equally pleasing with the lovely river winding itself to the village below and...like pretty much everywhere in the Faroes...beautiful mountains in the background. #faroeislands #haldarsvík #river #landscape #picturesque

Waterfall near Haldarsvík, Faroe Islands There is a lovely waterfall a short hike from Haldarsvík. It seems to me that every mountain in the Faroe Islands leaks...which is wonderful for photography. #faroeislands #waterfall #selfie #smallpeopleinbigplaces

Infamous - Saksun, Faroe Islands This seems to be quite a popular little hut to photograph in the Faroes. I can see why; it's a perfect little house in a beautiful location. I would love to spend my summers here. #Saksun #faroeislands #hut #lake #idyllic #beautiful #home #bestplacetolive

Kópakonan - Mikladalur, Faroe Islands I enjoyed reading the folktale of the Legend of Kópakonan, and seeing this statue in Mikladur brought that to life. I'm never sure what to expect when searching for a simple statue, but this one is well worth a visit.

Cliff looking out to Koltur - Vágar, Faroe Islands One of the most iconic locations in the Faroe Islands, where lake Leitisvatn sits on the side of a cliff; this view is looking out further along the cliff face. I managed a 2 minute iPhone long exposure in high winds while sat on the side of the cliff, using a @pockettripod for steadiness and my body to shield from the gusts of wind. #iphoneonly #faroeislands #cliff #coast #longexposure

Shard - London, United Kingdom It was while taking this image that I noticed the lovely light that was starting to come as the sun descended, and was what made me decide to head on over to Westminster in order to shoot the image I shared yesterday. One final day at work tomorrow before I @visitcopenhagen for a few days, and then I'm off to @visitfaroeislands - any suggestions of locations to visit on these trips are very welcome. #iphone #London #sunset #longexposure

Westminster Sunset - London, United Kingdom Such an iconic location in London, and one I am often happy to return to time and time again.  Last night I was at London Bridge after a day of wandering around London. After returning empty handed from Canary Wharf due to poor light, poor clouds and construction works I saw that the sun was finally starting to offer up better conditions and so hot footed it over to this spot to watch it retire for the day. This image was both taken and processed on my iPhone.  I recorded a video of myself processing it also, so you can watch out for that being released in the near future. #London #londoner #londoncity #london_only #longexposure #sunset #thames #westminsterbridge #westminster #river #snapseed #skrwt #momentwide #moment #iphoneonly

St George Wharf - London, United Kingdom The best thing about walking around taking iPhone images is that I'm not lugging a 14kg camera bag around with me...and that is a wonderful thing. Clouds were a little slow so had to do this long exposure over a couple of minutes, but it came out okay. #London #londoner #londoncity #longexposure #vauxhall #tower #blackandwhite #thames #river #snapseed #skrwt #doyouskrwt #momentlenses #momentwide

Westminster Bridge - London, United Kingdom I went for a walk after work and thought I would take a long exposure or two down at Westminster Bridge.

Mini cascade - Ouzoud, Morocco Arriving in Ouzoud after a 3 hour drive from Marrakech it was nice to get out and stretch my legs by walking on a lovely trail up to the impressive Ouzoud waterfalls. This is one of several falls downriver from the cascades themselves, but lovely to get a quick snap of on the way past. #Morocco #travel #marrakech #ouzoudfalls #waterfalls #river #motion #longexposure #nature #awesomeearth

Siege Bell War Memorial - Valletta, Malta With a grey and gloomy setting in London currently this scene from a nice and warm day in Malta a few weeks ago seems like rather a long time ago. Standing in the Lower Barrakka Gardens to get a view from the arch at the time of taking the photo, I later had he pleasure of standing right beside the memorial as the very large bell inside struck 8pm. In a few days I'll be heading out to The warmth of Morocco where I'll be spending Christmas. Hope to post something then, but if not - have a lovely festive period. #Valletta #Malta #lovemalta #bells  #arches #architecture #travel #europe #doyouskwrt #mrblueskies

Colosseum - Rome, Italy Ciao, Roma - it's been a blast. Had a fun few days in this wonderful city, but my feet are pretty happy that we're heading back to London, and indeed back to the office where they have very little work to do. I finally went into the Colosseum today, but took the time to grab this quick long exposure from my iPhone before heading on to The Vatican. Typically we had lovely cloud today, on the day I decided to travel light and not wander around with all of my camera gear (mostly so I could actually go inside places for once). For now, goodbye. I'm sure I will return. #Roma #Rome #RomanHoliday #colosseum #clouds #longexposure #Italy #architecture #WhenInRome

Red Umbrella - Rome, Italy Quite a few streets around the Navona area are decorated with red and white umbrellas suspended across the narrow streets. I'm not sure of the significance; perhaps someone is expecting a visit from Mary Poppins rather than Santa Claus this Christmas.  I like them though. #Roma #Rome #RomanHoliday #Navona #umbrella #red #Christmas #decoration #Italy #perspective #lookup

Sunset over St Peter's - Rome, Italy For my final night in Rome I was treated to a lovely sunset which fortunately featured clouds...pretty much the only ones I've seen on my trip. I was at the Altare dells Patria where I had anticipated spending the sunset, but hot footed it back to Ponte Umberto I when I realised it may turn out to be a nice one, allowing me to try and capture this scene - which I had been wanting to get on this trip. Time will tell if any of the 'proper camera' images turn out, but for now I'm happy enough with this iPhone image. #Rome #Roma #RomanHoliday #sunset #tiber #river #stpetersbasilica #santangelo #reflection #longexposure #iphone #momentlens #travel #loverome

'Bramante' Staircase - Vatican Museums, The Vatican Finally, I have been able to finally photograph this lovely staircase...just. I say 'just' as I also had a 'misunderstanding' with security who didn't want me to photograph the stairs from a particular viewpoint.  Yes, i agree the section I was in was cordoned off. Yes, I did slip through a gap in the barrier that was there.  However I did ask permission from a store worker there before doing so, and was given permission.  Seems my vague pointing at the barrier was lost in translation, though I think she fought my case against the security guy. Hard to tell without speaking Italian. #Vatican #museum #staircase #travel #photography #blackandwhite #spiralstaircase #descent #bramante #bramantestaircase #spirals #spiralstairs

Azure Window - Gozo, Malta After spending the last few days mooching around Malta I took in my last sunset in this country at the 'Azure Window' on the island of Gozo. A beautiful spot, but one where I wished I had something a little warmer than just a t-shirt - especially after the sun disappeared. #Malta #Gozo #island #limestone #arch #natural #beauty #coast #sunset #longexposure #lovemalta #lovegozo #maltaphotography

Ta Prohm Temple | Siem Reap, Cambodia Ta Prohm was a pretty cool temple to visit during my trip to the Angkor complex in Cambodia.  Though not representative in this image, this temple has a lot of overgrowth, with tree roots reclaiming the land everywhere that you look.  Though nature is awesome to see at work, I really liked stumbling upon this corridor which remained relative untouched. #Angkor #TaProhm #SiemReap #Cambodia #temple #columns #vanishingpoint #shadow #skrwt #enlight #Asia #travel

Coastguard's Cottage | Seaford, East Sussex, England I've just had a lovely birthday weekend on the South Coast of England. Though the weather yesterday wasn't very good, this morning it was perfect to go for a short walk. We spent some time wandering along the beach at Birling Gap before then heading to this spot by Seaford.  The cottages you see here used to be where the coastguard's resided, and if the background are the lovely Seven Sisters white cliffs. #England #coast #UK #cliffs #SevenSisters #EastSussex #bench #scenic #Landscape #coast

Walkway | Singapore, Republic of Singapore I was wandering around Chinatown in Singapore between a restaurant (where I ate a lovely whole chilli crab) and my hotel.  Chinese New Year was coming up and there was a great vibe around the bustling streets and the whole area had decorations up which included some really nice lanterns. Spying this walkway I was hoping to be able to get an elevated view of the lanterns and perhaps an opportunity to take a long exposure of them and the passing traffic on the main road below.  Alas, the scene from the walkway wasn't all I had hoped it would be, but the walkway itself was actually really nice - as you can see here. #Singapore #Night #Bridge #Walkway #Asia #Travel #Photography #AllHailSymmetry #DoYouSkrwt #VSCO #Snapseed #VanishingPoint

MOCA | Bangkok, Thailand The Museum of Contemporary Art in Bangkok is really quite excellent. As well as having this aesthetic sculpture outside, they have several floors of artwork and about 5 visitors viewing it.  In fact, each floor seems to have more staff than visitors in the building. They don't allow backpacks so I carried in my camera gear and placed it into a plastic bag from the gift shop. Very cunning, I thought, until an hour and a half later when both handles of the bag snapped suddenly and £4,000 worth of lenses went plummeting to the ground. My 70-200 took full force, with the 14mm then bouncing off that and rolling across the floor.  So far both lenses appear okay, so I'm hoping nothing funny starts happening to them with further use. #MOCA #Museum #Bangkok #Thailand #sculpture #Asia #reflection #art #Travel #photography #NoBackpacks

Tuk Tuk to the temples | Siem Reap, Cambodia One of the cheapest and easiest modes of transport here appears to be the Tuk Tuk, which is effectively a trailer attached to a scooter.  Though not quite as luxurious as a taxi with air conditioning, it's great to feel the wind in (what remains of) my hair after a lot of taking photos in silly heat. Cambodia itself seems awesome, the people here are really rather charming. #siemreap #siemreapdriver #Cambodia #temples #TukTuk #FromTheRear #Asia #Travel #photography

Spiral staircase at Sasana Kijang | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia In hot weather and harsh sunlight, I am a creature who will prefer to stay indoors. So my options are to stay in the hotel and nap, or try to find some interior locations to shoot.  I managed to do the latter and went to a museum simply so I could take a shot of a spiral staircase. #spiral #staircase #sasanakijang #KualaLumpur #Malaysia #interior #expectmorestairs

Petronas Twin Tower | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia This is such an awesome building. It's pretty difficult to shoot, or at least it certainly was tonight, due to factors such as the size, the number of people around, and certainly due to the stifling humidity we had tonight. Yet I was happy just to finally see it in person and look up at it in awe. #PetronasTwinTower #KualaLumpur #Malaysia #Asia #Travel #photography #Night #architecture

Valentine Yesterday I visited the S.E.A. Aquarium in Singapore.  It's a great place to visit, allowing me to cool off from the heat outside and look on in awe at all of the sea life they gave on display. It's so peaceful to watch fish swimming around. One tank had this heart in it, which is a teREEFic idea, and fitting for today. Happy Valentine's everyone. #Singapore #SEA #Aquarium #Reef #heart #love #Valentine #Sentosa #teREEFic #water #Asia

Singapore Sunrise Not the most eventful sunrise in Singapore this morning, but it's nice to be out and about to see it, especially while it is still nice and cool, and before I spend the day in a hotel for a conference. #Singapore #Asia #sunrise #marinabaysands #longexposure #golden #light #silhouette

Exposed | Rottingdean, England There have been many photography trips in the past year where I have left thinking my iPhone images from the day will likely turn out better than those taken with my DSLR, and yesterday was no exception. It may appear odd to those watching on when I set up a tripod and mount nothing other than my mobile phone onto it, and then attach a little lens to the phone, but the results are totally worth it. #blackandwhite #longexposure #iphone #Rottingdeam #England #UK #coast #sea #OhIDoLikeToBeBesideTheSeaside #mono #momentwide #momentlenses

West Pier | Brighton, England The old burnt out pier in Brighton is quite a sad sight, but also pretty aesthetic making a nice subject for photography.  I had this spot to myself this morning, and it wasn't too long before the tide you see in this image was covering my feet after I was caught by a surprise wave. I used the AverageCamera app to get a long exposure on my iPhone, making the shot much more dynamic due to the motion in the clouds and water. Processed with Snapseed and VSCOcam. #Brighton #England #UK #longexposure #beach #mono #motion #coast #sea #OhIDoLikeToBeBesideTheSeaside

Shard sunset | London, United Kingdom It feels like a very long time has passed since I was last out and about taking photos of London, so it was nice to be out there for a few hours today - even though it was pretty busy. We arrived at this spot just as the sun was setting perfectly between a couple of buildings. Hoping to shoot a lot more in London next year. #London #shard #dunset #longexposure #skrwt #vscocam #snapseed #architecture #anticrop

Vasco da Gama Bridge | Lisbon, Portugal This is an awesome bridge. It's about 10 miles in length, 6 of which runs over the water as it crosses the Tagus, and is one of the reasons why Lisbon has been on my list of places to visit. I was pleased to visit here during my weekend trip, and very pleased that the rain decided to stay away this day.

Oriente metro station | Lisbon, Portugal I haven't had the chance to have a decent look at many of the metro stations yet, but this one certainly had a few nice architectural elements to it. I also had a 5 minute chat with a cleaning lady, but as she only spoke 7 words in English, and her English was 1000% better than my Portuguese, it was a bit of a struggle.  In the end I understand she didn't want me taking photos of her, and that we're friends. #Lisbon #Portugal #travel #photography #metro #station #underground #symmetry #silhouette #vscocam #

National Pantheon | Lisbon, Portugal I didn't have this location on my list of places to visit in Lisbon, but as I was wandering around in the rain this morning my gaze fell upon the dome of this building and I thought it may act as a good place to dry out a bit - and boy was I right! I spent a long time in here and really feel like I got value out of my €4 entrance fee. #Lisbon #Portugal #travel #photography #national #pantheon #architecture #balconies #expectmoredoors #doorway #view #interior #skrwt #vscocam #snapseed

Chancery Lane - London, United Kingdom I love the London Underground. It's not as beautiful as that in Moscow, or as efficient as the one in Tokyo, or as clean as the one in Beijing...but it's still awesome.

Sunset Reflected - Copenhagen, Denmark Atop the Round Tower you can catch a lovely view of the sun setting over Copenhagen. It was setting over the, perhaps, less interesting part of the city when I was there, but it's lovely to see anyway. As the city didn't hold too much interest I looked around to try and find something in the foreground that would work instead, and this circular window was perfect. #copenhagen #denmark #europe #RoundTower #sunset #reflection #window #round #colourful

Terminal 3 - Copenhagen, Denmark I actually quite like airports.  This is a good thing due to the amount of time I have been spending in them this year. They are all different, and yet they are all the same. Somehow, though, they feel completely removed from shopping malls.  I guess malls are filled with people who are there by choice, whereas airports are simply full of people who are waiting to get elsewhere. #consumerism #airport #copenhagen #denmark #waiting #time #clock #architecture

Amalienborg - Copenhagen, Denmark This statue can be seen at Amalienborg in Copenhagen. I managed to time my arrival at this location to coincide with the arrival of not one, but two bus loads of Japanese tourists. As such I opted to concentrate on details more than wide shots and thought the silhouette of this statue was quite appealing. #copenhagen #denmark #europe #travel #photography #statue #silhouette #horse #charge #clouds #ifthiswasmyhorseiwouldcallitshadow

Axelborg - Copenhagen, Denmark One of the many places I really wanted to visit on my trip to Copenhagen was the Axelborg building and the excellent looking balconies they had on offer.  Alas, the doors were closed and fully locked when I got there. @chiragushka was also in search of the same location at that stage, and after waiting around for what seemed like hours we finally managed to gain access and shoot this marvellous architecture. Well worth a visit if in Copenhagen. Tomorrow I'm heading to the @birdie_conf in London; hope to meet some of you there - otherwise have a great weekend. #roundseries #architecture #copenhagen #denmark #blackandwhite #b&w #bw #black #white #balconies #negativespace #contrast #light #shadow #staircase #europe #travel #photography #makemoments #momentlenses #momentwide

View from the Round Tower - Copenhagen, Denmark In a rare case of synchronicity, I have posted this very image today in my daily photoblog - so if you would like to see my DSLR version of this scene head on over to http://www.murphyz.co.uk I visited this location several times during my trip to Copenhagen, and this outing was my favourite due to the fact a sunset was happening on one side if the city, while the moon was rising on the other (you can just make out the moon in this shot). I also had the pleasure of meeting up with @bessi_19 during this visit. #Copenhagen #Denmark #Europe #RoundTower #rooftops #view #sunset #moon #scenic #city #visitcopenhagen #orange #momentwide #momentlenses #vscocam

Overpass - Wakefield Westgate, England You can find very aesthetic scenes in the most unexpected places, and this one was in a small train station in England.  I couldn't tell from the materials and rough edges whether or not this tunnel was only a temporary thing while waiting for something more architecturally sound to be built, but it certainly caught my eye as I walked through it. I'm pleased that someone else had decided to walk through at that moment also. #tunnel #silhouette #mono #blackandwhite #train #station #england #UK

Terminal 3 - Copenhagen, Denmark What else is there to do when standing around waiting for a train, other than to take photos of the station you are in? Well, 'many things' is probably the correct answer, but as I had all of one minute to wait for the metro train to arrive and take me into Copenhagen I opted to whip the phone out and grab this image. I processed it using VSCOcam, which I haven't given enough time to previously but am starting to now appreciate as a great app for processing mobile images. Copenhagen was awesome, and I was pleased when I saw this exact location and scene on my way back out of there yesterday. #Copenhagen #airport #terminal #waiting #area #Denmark #Scandinavia #Europe #travel #visitcopenhagen #waiting #transportation #TheGreatestDaneIsScoobyDoo

Aller Media offices - Copenhagen, Denmark This morning took a walk along the waterfront towards Tivoli Hotel & Conference Centre and was caught in quite a lot if rain.  After hiding for some time it finally stopped, and there were some pretty nice clouds to be found - in between the white blankets that were in the sky before and pretty soon after the shower. I had just enough time to grab this long exposure of the clouds moving over the Aller Media, a newspaper publisher, offices.  That's the triangular type one in the right. The sky quickly lost its form, and so I retired somewhere for coffee. My feet are not thanking me for all of the walking I did yesterday, so I'm going to take it easy for the rest of the afternoon before my flight home tonight. #Copenhagen #Denmark #Europe #travel #photography #Scandinavia #longexposure #clouds #movement #iphone #iphoneography #AllerMedia #architecture #apps #averagecamera #skrwt #facetune #snapseed

British Museum - London, England I've just purchased a MeFOTO SideKick Mobile Phone Holder for my iPhone photography, and what better place to give it a test run than the British Museum...partly due to their 'no tripods' policy, but mostly because it's within a minute of where I work and I'm lazy. I attached the phone to the holder, attached my @moment_lens wide lens to the phone and rested it on the ledge found at the top of this set of busy stairs. Using the Average Camera app I think took 128 exposures which resulted in any people moving up and down the staircase being ghosted out. Finally I processed in Skrwt, Facetune, Snapseed, Retouch and VSCOcam.  All of these apps were known to me due to a mini iPhone-Photography-essentials workshop I had with @thefella at an airport recently.  I heartily recommend you snap up a 1-on-1 workshop with him, or better still join him, @danrubin and @greg_a on their upcoming Landscape Photography & Post-processing workshop in Iceland later this month. Today I'm heading out to Copenhagen, so have a great Friday. #BritishMuseum #stairs #staircase #stairporn #archtecture #London #longexposure #england #UK #interior #iphoneography #iphone #momentwide #momentlenses #mefoto #statue #expectmorestairs #skrwt #vscocam #retouch #snapseed #facetune #averagecamera #shhh #notripodsallowed

Louvre Pyramid, Paris, France The entrance to the famous Louvre museum in Paris is a lovely large glass pyramid. A few smaller pyramids can also be found nearby, It's great to stumble upon this scene and see such modern architecture surrounded by historic buildings. As you can tell by this image I visited here at night time and took this whole waiting for my DSLR to take a long exposure. #paris #france #europe #louvre #museum #pyramid #glass #modern #architecture #futuristic #art #design #night #AliensBuiltIt #landmark #icon #spaceship #vivalafrance

Beachy Head Lighthouse - East Sussex, United Kingdom This beautiful location has a dark side.  It's the #3 suicide hotspot in the world. The last time I took a morning walk to the base of the lighthouse itself I passed the burnt out remains of a car that been driven off the cliff a few months previously.  When recovering the body from the car the unfortunate fill who have such a job also found a second body of someone who had taken the leap. It's a beautiful spot, and on a sunny day I like nothing more than walking along the cliffs admiring what Mother Nature has provided us with, but at that same time I know that many people gone here to say goodbye to the world - that makes it a lot more solemn. #BeachyHead #sussex #cliffs #white #sea #ocean #coast #Seaside #lighthouse #UK #england #coastline #ohidolovetobebesidetheseaside #dontworrybehappy

Dubrovnik, Croatia On my first visit to this area it was packed with people. I guess that's to be expected at 9pm on a sunny day.  Returning about 9 hours later though it was a different story.  The sun was still to come up and the blue hour was in full swing.  More to the point, most visitors to this beautiful old city were still in bed meaning I was able to take my time and shoot this scene from a few different angles. #Dubrovnik #Croatia #Europe #Balkans #door #expectmoredoors #arches #architecture #lights #cobbles #oldtown #gothic #RectorsPalace #KneževDvor

Sands of time Here's another long exposure iPhone image taken from Walton-on-the-Naze yesterday. In between brilliant sunshine and blue sky we had some excellent cloud movement.  I set up the phone on a plastic bucket by the shoreline in order to grab this snap. Taken with the iPhone 5S using the PocketTripod (and a bucket), @moment_lens wide lens, and the Average camera app, it was then processed in Snapseed and Retouch. #Seaside #ocean #UK #ohidolovetobebesidetheseaside #clouds #motion #momentwide #momentlenses #makemoments #snapseed #retouch #averagecamera #beach #ihavesandinplacesthatsandshouldnotgo

Walton-on-the-Naze, United Kingdom I spent several hours of today sat on the beach at Walton-on-the-Naze.  I had a lovely time, and we had ice cream prior to leaving which is when I grabbed this image. Taken with the iPhone 5S, the wide @moment_lens lens and the AverageCamera app, I then processed in Skrwt, Retouch and Snapseed. #Seaside #beach #longexposure #hut #clouds #UK #motion #snapseed #skrwt #ohidolovetobebesidetheseaside

Waiting - Split, Croatia Flying out of Split airport back to London, @thefella and I opted to stop in the town of Split itself for lunch.  After parking the car we walked through the train station where I saw these folk sitting and waiting, which I thought worked beautifully with a clock in the middle of the scene. The shot was taken on the iPhone 5S and processed with various apps including Skrwt to straighten some lines out, Retouch to get rid of a few shadows across the scene, and Snapseed for the overall look. #Balkans #Split #Croatia #Train #Station #Waiting #Europe #clock #time #passing #travel #photography #thedaywecaughtthetrain #choochoo

Stari Most Bridge - Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina This image was taken during a sunrise at Stari Most bridge in Mostar.  Without any clouds in the sky it was proving difficult to get a compelling image, but while my DSLR was firing away beside me I decided to get low down with the iPhone and grab a few shots of the water flowing past, knowing that I would be processing the image in black & white. I think this turned out pretty well in the end and have come to appreciate the negative space above the bridge. #travel #photography #europe #Mostar #starimost #bridge #bosnia #herzegovina  #makemoments #momentwide #snapseed #averagecamera #iphone #iphoneography  #balkans #river #motion  #longexposure

Guardians - Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina After walking down the Revolution Boulevard, a former demarcation line, it was nice to see the brightness and condition of these doors, which looked perfect by comparison to the destruction we had just seen.  It's amazing to see how much nature reclaims in such a short space of time, and to think if this building was left alone for 20 years the greenery you would see is likely to be that of plant life instead of paint work. #travel #photography #europe #Mostar #bosnia #herzegovina #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography #balkans #expectmoredoors #green

Dubrovnik, Croatia It feels like an age ago when I was sat watching the sun set behind Dubrovnik castle. In reality it was just a couple of days ago. @thefella and I headed from the beautiful Mostar in Bosnia down to the Croatian coast for the final leg of our trip.  I would love to visit this place if it has an out of season time, but the swarm of tourists there while we were meant it quickly lost any charm it may have had.  Sitting on a small beach here in relative solitude was certainly the highlight of our short time there. This image was taken with the iPhone 5S and, as with most of my recent Instagram images, the @moment_lens wide angle lens and the average camera app - it was then processed in Snapseed. #travel #photography #europe #Dubrovnik #Croatia #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography  #balkans #castle #coast #sunset #longexposure

Cat in a sink, Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina Cats and dogs seem to be running around the whole of the Balkans, and @thefella seems to make time to say hello, and stroke, each and every one of them we meet. This particular cat was around the corner from the apartment we stayed in during our second night in Mostar.  As we headed out to shoot the sunset this little fella popped his head out of the sink, creating a purrfect photo opportunity. #travel #photography #europe #Mostar #Bosnia #herzegovina #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #boat #lake  #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography #balkans #cat #everythingincludingthekitchensink #felinegood #animals #cute

Stari Most bridge, Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina Today @thefella and I left the beautiful old town of Mostar to drive to another beautiful old town, this time Dubrovnik in Croatia. Before leaving, however, we crawled out of the flat first thing in the morning for yet another sunrise shoot at this wonderful bridge. This particular image was taken the day before whole waiting to watch someone dive off into the river below.  It was taken with the iPhone 5S using the Average Camera app and the @moment_lens wide angle iPhone lens.  Processing was then done via Snapseed and Retouch. #travel #photography #europe #Bosnia #Herzegovina #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #mostar #starimost #bridge #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography #retouch #balkans

Pluzine, Montenegro Getting up for a sunrise at this lake was nearly a fruitless exercise as the people running the B&B that @thefella and I were staying in had decided to leave for the night and lock all visitors inside. We were able to find a phone number for them and get someone back to unlock it before the house caught fire and burned down, and before Conor decided to kick a door/wall down to escape. Dawn from this tranquil lake was then really nice. Image taken with the iPhone 5s and wide lens from @moment_lens, then processed with Snapseed and Retouch. #travel #photography #europe  #montenegro #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #boat #lake #pluzine #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography #balkans

This picturesque scene was taken with the @moment_lens wide lens for iPhone in the beautiful town of Perast, Montenegro. @thefella and I had driven down from Croatia and walked along Kotor Bay looking for somewhere to grab a drink before sunset when this scene presented itself, and worked surprisingly well while shooting into the sun. Taken with the iPhone 5S this was then proceed in Snapseed and a few other apps including Skrwt, Retouch and Resizer to get the finished look. #travel #photography #europe #perast #montenegro #momentlenses #makemoments #momentwide #boat #lake #kotor #snapseed #iphone #iphoneography #resizerapp #balkans

Perast | Montenegro This morning @thefella and I headed out pre-dawn and in between storms to try and catch a sunrise. Not much colour, but we experienced some great clouds and stood facing an incoming storm watching the lightning bounce off the mountains. Then we got soaked.
