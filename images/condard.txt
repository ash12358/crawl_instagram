Google making passive aggressive remarks about how long I waited to get my haircut. BTW @valeriephoenixxsalon is wonderful. I won't go see anyone else for my haircut needs.

Saw black smoke from my place so naturally I had to get a closer look. Turns out it's a barge fire.

I fell asleep at 6:30pm last night. I woke up at 10:30am this morning or so I thought... I dreamed I woke up at 10:30am and my panic woke me up for real. It was 7:40 in the morning. I had to get ready for work. Or was it? It was 7:40pm. I fell back asleep and when I opened my eyes the light was exactly the same. But I traveled back in time to 7:20pm. Was I dreaming still? No. It was 7:20am, and time to get ready for work.

Happy Birthday, @johnjamesrenfrow (in like 35 minutes). I cherish the old times, but glad we don't live there. As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another... or sometimes one man's nonsense makes another's more ridiculous. Looking forward to what's in store for you this year and praying that it's full of joy. Love you, brother.

GDC and checking out San Francisco with @virginiaspotts was a blast. Was great catching up with friends, making new ones, and hanging out. We were in Mammoth Lakes for a whole week before this. We come back to Seattle Sunday morning.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/115af5746e9b08ac5ce3c115a7f8e2e5/5BCCDF3A/t51.2885-15/e35/28435937_384435192022463_3283395213803913216_n.jpg
Snowboarding for the first time ever for @virginiaspotts and myself with @snickersnacks being our snow friend who showed us what to do. Virginia did really well and I did a little too much. I definitely scorpioned a few times. Pretty sure I felt my board touch the back of my head somehow on one such fall and I may have broken my nose on another (it looks a little different now as seen in the pictures), but I had a blast even while bleeding and hope to go again sometime.

Emboldened by successfully recaulking a shower a few months ago, I attempted to replace a toilet and sink. I'm happy with the results. New granite countertop looks good, but it still needs a tile back splash.

The longest drive back to Rio Rancho from Midland, TX. Saw a lot of things in NM turning our 6 hour drive into a meandering 18 hour one. This is at White Sands National Monument. The Monument is the sand and also in the middle of a missile test field so good luck ever trying to steal the sand. You would go to missile jail.

This cave was so big my mind still isn't sure it how to categorize the experience. I thought caves this big only existed in video games (took 2 hours to get through even without random encounters). But honestly, I keep thinking that if this is Carl's bad caverns, I can't wait to see his good ones.

Don't worry we saved the game before going in. I think our level is high enough that we won't have to worry.

I didn't fall asleep until 3:30. Virginia woke up before 8 this morning like it was a holiday. Turns out it is a holiday, balloons are landing outside, we're getting breakfast burritos, and I might get to see my favorite balloon again.

This is the first time I've met a spider that I thought was pretty. I like its state fair air brush look. Like it couldn't decide between tiger and bumblebee so it went for both and then also wanted a sweet gradient. Every time I moved it from where I was weeding it kept trying to get close to a particular rose bush. So it seems to have good taste as well.

This was ridiculous. The 93rd annual burning of #Zozobra. Over 40,000 people in a park in Santa Fe waiting to see this go up. Thousands wrote their gloom and depression on paper that was put in boxes and loaded into this thing to be burned away with it. It was pretty special and I walked away with a smile on my face. Kind of hard to be gloomy after something like this.

This house layout feels completely unreal to me with lofty 30 foot ceilings and every common space melting into one with no arch or pillar of matching design or angle. I see spaces like this in my dreams so it has been an unexpected delight to work on.

A flurry of sound and motion as 4 plus birds smash into the window. I run over to see and it's already silent. I tried to get a video, but I couldn't. I barely got this picture of an entire baguette taking up the length of this bird as the sole victor with its spoils. I wept. What a treat.

There's a sweet arcade in Burlington, VT called The Archives. They had NBA Jam tournament edition, as well as many other games from my childhood Saturdays down at either Factoria Mall or Sun Villa arcades. They had the 6 player X-men arcade game so, naturally, I played through it alone as Colossus. I'm better at it now than I was as a 10 year old meaning I was able to beat it on less than 5 dollars by myself.

We decided to look up houses in this town on zillow. They ranged from 130k to 500k. The 500k ones were 8 bedroom, 5 bath monsters on an acre of land in architectural styles of the mid 18th century. One we saw, which may have been the price of a house in Wallingford neighborhood of seattle, was at least 11,000 Sq feet with a giant fountain out front with a Wallingford sized house of a guest house in the backyard.

"In Memory of [...]" We value history over memory. This grave yard is a memorial to the memorials of those who came before those who came before us. That's not a typo. As stone faces fade, we marvel that they are so old they cannot be read. We are reverent not of memorial, but mystery. This is not criticism, but a reality of humanity. There is no memory of the dead, only history. No one would think it wise to replace the old stone and slate headstones to make them legible that memory can remain, but isn't that why the living made them stone to begin with? To be remembered? Yet a mere hundred years wipes away even those who care to remember a farmer or servant of no renown. This is history. There is no memory of the dead and his place remembers him no more.

Walking around with an empty Styrofoam cup for 2 blocks looking for any public trash can. We're not in Washington anymore... Well technically, we are on Washington Street, but that's not the same. Last night I had a full tray of trash after a meal and there was one bin labeled trash. I didn't realize how used to sorting like anthropologist comparing the remains of a meal to the runes on the wall that depict their placement for a clean conscience.

What I want most from these first two days is to hear someone yell "I'm walking here!"

Also those murder machines, ride the ducks are here as well. I will hate them here too.

The last day of #whole30 which is day 30. A few things I've learned: my sleep issues are not food or drink related. Good to know. My sleep/wake cycle is still a mystery trash grab bag. Never good but always different. But now I know it's not healthy eating related. I lost 12 pounds. No clue where it went, but I could probably find it at the bottom of a few gallons of icecream if I really tried. While whole30 comes to an end, #wholeConrad goes on. Guess I'll find out over the next two weeks if any of the foods I've removed turn me into a swamp monster as I re-add them. 10/10 so far. Would whole30 again. This might just be what January is like every year from now on.

#wholeConrad day 22? I think? Yeah that sounds about right. Nothing new to report really. #whole30 has got me spending a whole lot more time in the kitchen.

Day 11: statistically the hardest day of #whole30. I'm enjoying a 40 of sparkling water at a birthday party surrounded by pizzas I'm not eating. Sorry. I misspoke... I meant that I'm enjoying the shit out of a 40 of sparkling water. This is #wholeConrad. I filled up on shrimp, sweet potatoes and zucchini before coming out. I guess this is how you post about stuff like this. I think I still miss nicotine most.

#whole30 day 7 mumble mumble... I have nothing interesting to say. Fight food... uh, thoughts... by cleaning your office and organizing your toolbox. Give it a fun nickname like "Tooley" or "Boxton" I think

So I've heard day 6 is incredibly difficult on #whole30 but really, it's ok. The worst part of this day, and possibly this whole month, is that my wife got laid off from the company I still work at. I basically lost my appetite so I got that going for me. #wholeConrad

This is the day of #whole30 where you supposedly have an urge to seek out orange shoe polish. That's right... it's Day 3 and like clockwork, I spent my lunch trying to find shoe polish for my orange shoes while finding a cobbler who could also fix my insoles while I wait. Oh, This doesn't sound whole30 related to you? Well this is #wholeConrad and I'm just starting to come out of the giant white whale looking for revenge blood state and feeling a little more normal. I don't think that reference was in the whole30 book either. Anyways, quitting nicotine cold turkey is always rough.

Day 2? Yeah. Day 2. These are for eating and they are called eggs. I tried to argue with @virgamania that heroin is not prohibited on #whole30 because the only place it's mentioned in the rules is telling you that quitting heroin is harder than not eating sugar and bread for like 30 days. That sounds like an implicit allowance. She brings up the valid point that it is dangerous, illegal, and unhealthy. Good points. While neither of us have any reason to do heroin nor feel impressed upon by a temptation to try, clarifying the rules really helps me achieve my best. #wholeConrad

I'm doing that #whole30 thing where I take my unhealthy desire for food and alcohol and metabolize it into internet posts instead. No jk, that's not what it is, but I am doing it, and that; by that I mean all of the 30. The whole thing. #wholeConrad This is your punishment for following me. Today is day one of the 30 day program which means it's like yesterday where I wake up feeling like my brain has been hit by a truck and it's just coming out of a 2 week coma in the hospital, disoriented. Except today, I had eggs for breakfast also. #ｋｉｌｌｉｎｇｉｔ

Found it! This is my reference sheet for the final boss music to the Double Dragon II cover I started years ago. I think this sheet is 3 years old. I got lost with how many available patterns I had used up and spent an afternoon tracing my steps back to figure out how many unused phrases I had left. According to this sheet, I have 25 left. This inspired me to make a google spreadsheet for tracking so I can also label which channel is using which phrase and chain... I have yet to make it. I kind of dreamed of making a song editor in spreadsheets that just left the work of data entry allowing me to compose for #LSDJ without a #gameboy if need be. I'm also in dire need of mapping out my sound bank. I have never made a record of the synths I have created along the way and tediously recreate them each time I start a new track. I really need to make a default save that has my sounds as a preset including my favorite tables, but I've enjoyed starting over each time to explore what is possible within the confines of this withered tech. #chiptuning causes me to dwell on the words "Now we see dimly, as in a mirror, but then we will see face to face." The greatest and richest music and art of our day, no matter how realistic, may be the equivalent of gameboy sounds in comparison to the richness of a philharmonic orchestra or a cross stitch pattern of an orchid to a 4k rendering of a field of flowers in the realm of what is possible to express and be received through expression.

How I track out a hymn for arranging on a #gameboy. Found this while looking for my Double Dragon II reference notes. My process with a hymn is to analyze the chords of the original composition before sequencing a single note or even deciding which key to place it in. That's what all the Roman numerals are. The ones shown are different from the original. This is draft two. I used this as my map for writing during a 5 hour plane flight. It's also important to to determine if there is a lead in before beat one. I once sequenced an entire arrangement of a hymn starting from the lead in which was on beat 4. There's no simple way to remedy that after the fact using #LSDJ. #chiptuning #hymn

Used some ThermoMorph pellets and some carving tools to repair this vintage ash tray from my dad's commercial airline pilot days. Now as long as no one throws boiling water on the mold this will hold together. This was a lot friendlier to trial and error than using epoxy or some kind of cement.

The trip is almost over. We're back in Seattle on the light rail home. We don't really have any words to talk to each other with right now because we're glad the plane ride over and that we're finally through customs. We decided on Thai food as our homecoming meal. One of us in this picture slept on the plane and wants more. The other has been awake since 4pm PDT yesterday (midnight Iceland time) and is loud even in silence. I hope you all enjoyed the posts as we've been on out and about.

These two were milling about in the crowd and came up to listen to a busker I was standing next to. They are natives of Greenland and live in its capital of Nuuk. They were all smiles all the time. We talked about the flight from Greenland and when the busker started playing Dire Straits the guy got all giddy and sang along while his wife recorded a video. We compared weather stories, apparently it's already snowing in Nuuk and about 10 degrees colder than Iceland right now on average. He was happy to share he knows one person from Seattle who is a Boeing engineer who likes to kayak in rivers. His wife did not speak much English but she thought the name Seattle was funny. They were adorable and danced to the guitar playing amidst drunk folks stumbling past them. Greenland sounds beautiful and I'm happy to have met some people from there.

This picture was taken just now at 3:30am. Having trouble sleeping tonight so I decided to take a bit of a walk. My street, Skólavörðustígur, in front of Hallgrimskirkja is silent and serene, but at its end where it meets the main shopping road I walked past scene after scene of the party just getting started. There is no special occassion. It's just Saturday night. Broken bottles litter the street, drunk guy's cat call women passing by and everyone is giggling or yelling. There are no laws against open containers so people wait in line to one of the dozens of restaurants turned live music dance clubs keeping their pregame buzz alive. Almost everyone out here is Icelandic. This is when most of them come out. Because alcohol is so expensive (a 1.5l of Carlo Rossi at the state liquor store runs at 18 US dollars for instance and a 5th of Jameson is about 65 USD) icelanders pregame until what we Americans call closing time. They go out to maintain the buzz and dance. If you put 3 pioneer squares next to each other it still wouldn't compare to the level of party these streets maintain. Surprisingly, someone was dealing meth and asked me if I was looking in a manner familiar to me with a quick 1 word question when passing at my 4 or 5 o'clock after making eye contact when they were in front of me. Though no one here seems aggressive or violent, the scene is in stark contrast to what Reykjavik will look like at sunrise around 8:30. Gone are the wool sweaters as everyone is in a mix of three piece suits and club wear. The only sober people I see are taxi drivers, the occasional police car, anyone driving actually, and the guy who tried to sell me meth. Drunk tourists are the ones in Northface jackets. As I was writing this out I've been hit up for directions twice and once for where to buy chewing tobacco. The sound of broken glass is surprisingly constant. At 7:30am sidewalk sized street sweepers will come and clean it up before the town wakes up. It will look as though tonight never happened as church bells ring signifying the start of service at the Catholic Church opposite the city center from Hallgrimskirkjka.

The hymns of the Passion was written by Hallgrimur Petursson in the 1600s. It was first published in 1666 and the English edition I'm holding here was first published in 1966. This book is the most influential and beloved Christian writing for Icelanders since it was written. It is verses of poetry easy enough for a child to understand. The collection of 50 poems is broadcasted in song on the radio every year during Lent. Though it deals solely with the crucifixion of Jesus it is not a shoegazer or a downer. I've been sitting here in the square in front of Hallgrímskirkja, named after the author of this collection, reading through it enjoying the sunset on my last night in Reykjavik before returning home to Seattle tomorrow.

It's the first day of winter according to the old Norse calendar and that means decorations go up over the street of Skólavörðustígur. We did not know this, but what a send off for our last full day here. Many restaurants load up meat stew in large pots and hand out bowls to everyone on the street. As much as you'd like I must have tried 4 different variations. They were all delicious. This was not a commercial affair. There were no vendors and traditionally the soup serving starts with those in the minimum security jail here on the street. Icelanders were out in full and you couldn't walk 10 meters without seeing someone spoon feeding soup to a child in a stroller.

This restaurant has lamb, horse, and whale on the menu. What even does that. Also wine. Lots of wine.

This is the drowning pool that was used for a few hundred years as an official execution ground. Various moral offenses were tried and sentenced here. It is no wonder to me why modern Iceland has such a distrust of Christianity and religion in general when people in the name of the church enforced mandatory tithes, strict law adherence with penalties including drowning, burning, beheading, hanging, flogging, and in one case of a Catholic retaliation on the execution of one of their bishops by Lutherans, hot molten lead in the mouth to the Lutheran executioner. Sure I don't have the full story and all the context, but boy do those things stand out. We do not live in a just world today, but the world we were born into was not always televised and no where has a rosy history when you dig. Seeing this place reminds me that I don't want to go back to the way things were, whatever that means, ever. Because the way things were led to the problems we have today always and it was a bad time for someone then as well. Better to solve today's problems with a knowledge of what was before with a clear conscious than pine for days past whether a year ago, decade ago, or centuries. Blessed are the peacemakers, those who restore a brother gently, and those who don't fear or revere death and punishment, but cherish grace. "Say not, 'why were the former days better than these?' For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."

The walls on either side of this path are a fault line. This path leads to the drowning pool. It's like a solemn and severe hall of government. Funny enough, this where Iceland's Government, the Althing met yearly. The walls seem to be made of faces with moss covered brows in judgmental consternation and solemn noses protruding from hardened cheek bones. It was eerie and large ravens quarked from the cliffs as we walked by groups of school children and tourists seemingly unaware or ambivalent to the dark history here.

Found a pool that restores MP, guessing there's a boss fight soon but no save anywhere nearby. Pardon the nerd humor. seriously though, this would probably be really relaxing to lay in because nothing gets rid of stress like melting off all of your skin and muscles and dying. Ultimate relaxation. No thanks for me. I like my stresses like what am I going to watch on Netflix when I get home in 2 days?

Far off shot of Strokkur. Again, crazy how close people are able to stand to it. Goes off like every 2 minutes. There is a bigger one at this same location, but it stopped going off about a decade ago. Then an earthquake happened in like 2008 and it was spouting off for 2 days straight. Big sassy Geysir. That's what I call it.

Here our host, Maria, at a geo thermal spa, demonstrated how to bake bread in wet boiling sand with a pot in the ground and a shovel. It was Dark rye bread and tasted like fleeting joy and comfort. much like you'd expect skillfully baked food to taste in a lightless bleak winter that took grandfather just days earlier. In other words, it was amazing. I have the recipe, but I lack a field of boiling hot black sand in which to place the pot for 24 hours.

Reykjavik and their gimmick bars. We hit up the Chuck Norris grill. It's exactly what you'd expect. Then we went to the Lebowski Bar. There is a White Russian menu with about 20 different concoctions. Bowling paraphernalia on the walls and oriental rugs everywhere with signs indicating they are not for peeing on.

Look at this majestic hair. This horse is named Concert. It was also sassy. Just like the rest of this entire island.

My horse had better hair than me. Oh yeah! By the way, I rode a horse for the first time. It was like having a live furry motorcycle with limited auto pilot features. Icelandic horses aren't actually small, they're a little short, but they're tough. I mean every horse here looks like it wants to go to metal show. Their hair is amazing.

Kind of wishing the U.S. gave Iceland as big of a statue as France gave them. "Discoverer of Vinland"* acknowledges America, but we still flirting with Columbus and Loki in love with him. . . *Vinland was the name Leif gave America because it looked like a great place to get hammered. He wasn't wrong. And it's better than naming it after a mispronunciation of a cartographer who can't help but scribble his name on everything as the proto DRM copyright protection against map fraud. Wow, I can't tell which name is more American now.

I found a big offensive cup of coffee. Also, it took going to Iceland to check out a Dunkin' Donuts. I was walking down Laugavegur last night around 10pm and I saw this monstrous object out of the corner of my eye in a darkened store. It was a 20 ounce cup. I immediately turned in the direction of the Statue of Liberty and whispered "thank you, capitalism" (didn't actually do that). I knew I would be returning in the morning to order a 20 oz drip, or a 591 milliliter filter coffee, as the name just rolls off the tongue.* . . *actually the name is Stór Kaffi, but I just asked "can I get a big coffee?" And here we are.

You're probably wondering what this impossibly small replica of a drinking glass that suggests it could hold 8 ounces of water if filled to the brim... Well I'll tell you: it is the actual size of any cup anywhere on this entire island. I need roughly 25 of these a day. Coffees are this small too. I hate it. The only thing unaffected by this size thing is beer and wine, but that's not the same. Next time I come to Iceland I'm going to bring an offensively large 24 ounce mug. When I go to buy coffee I will pay for four cups and hand them the corrupted oversized abomination which seems to have enough volume for all the desires of hell in their eyes. My request will not waver and I will be a monster to them.

Drove almost 200km through a tropical storm this morning caused by hurricane Nicole. It was Bananas. Our bed and breakfast host, a mysterious older lady, told us "No you do not go. Stay here and eat more breakfast. The storm is bad." We insisted we had to leave and She then pointed to 5 different areas on a map in the wall showing where things were going to be the worst as we drove and where to recheck conditions. She was not wrong. It was bad. But we made it without flying off the road.

Gas stations are one of my favorite things about this country. People kick it here. Hotdogs are a staple food and they are plentiful and cheap and better than anything found in an AMPM or 7-11 in the states. This particular station had sweaters for sale and a bulletin board of the live entertainment for the month available in a nearby town. It was 11am when we rolled through and they were rocking Air's Moon Safari for those sitting inside eating hotdogs and catching up with other residents. Gas stations in Iceland are kind of magical.

Snaefellsnes peninsula is my favorite area of Iceland. It's about as wide as the Seattle metropolitan area from North to South and about as long as the distance traveling from Seattle to Snoqualmie pass. It's jam packed with lava fields, fjords, open Atlantic shores, waterfalls, mountains, and pasture lands for livestock. We drove around its perimeter in a single day and even with numerous stops and exploration I feel we barely scratched the surface. There was never a dull thing to look at. Snæfellsjökull is a glacier covered volcano in the center of it all that hasn't erupted in a few millennia. I hope it never does. Its peak has been hiding in the clouds the whole time we've been out here. I wish I could spend a whole month out here some time and I find myself sad to return to Reykjavik only because it means I am leaving this place.

These rocks are ancient job interviews and fisherman pastime devices. Their names from left to right translate to Useless, Weakling, Half-strength, and Full-strength. To work on a boat, A fisherman had to at least be able to lift Weakling to chest height and place it at a waist level shelf on that rock in the background. For reference, full-strength is a little over 150 kg and each one is half the weight of its bigger neighbor. I was able to lift Weakling no problem. Full-strength I could get it onto its side like that but these things are so smooth they take a great amount of finger strength and dexterity to grip. The story goes that fishermen would especially play this game after being exhausted from fishing all day and in wet lambskin clothes. Wrestling and having the equivalent of a rap battle were other favorites for entertainment.

This rocky path through a moss covered lava field is an ancient fisherman's path by Dritvik on the Snaefellsnes peninsula. It's about kilometer between the seasonal village which hasn't been inhabited for over a century and the beach where the boats would shove off. There are stacks of rocks used as trail markers and makeshift store houses for drying fish scattered along paths like these.

Waterfalls. These things are bananas. I don't remember this one's name but it's huge and there is a cave behind it. human sized people in background for scale of the great waterfall and our own insignificance. Oh yeah, it's Seljalandsfoss. Now you have the name.

Our first Air BnB experience in Iceland. We caused some cat drama when a cat followed us home from dinner. We asked our hosts if they had an orange cat. They did not. The cat sat outside meowing. Our host let the cat into a sideroom and gave it food. This morning the cat freely roams the house with their cat looking on suspiciously. They named it Shrek to go along with their current cat, Fiona.

A picture of my face for a post about me: my exploration of understanding how to live with a #DSPD (delayed sleep phase disorder) and enjoy life. I spent a year and a half collecting data on my sleep habits monitoring how changes affect my circadian rhythm: a year taking Nuvigil/Armodafinl to kick start mornings, a year and a half of melatonin to shift schedule, 9 months of sun lamp mornings to shift schedule, blue light blocking glasses, limiting screen time at night, coffee intake, sleep aids that target melatonin production, exercise routines, and more. None of these could tame it but did help. Can't take wake up pills if I can't wake up, can't get a regimented routine of exercise if I can't predict my mornings or evenings. All these things have helped to manage it and have made understanding this condition a joy and a great science experiment. Lately I have turned my attention to things that are not directly related to sleep and wakefulness. I did a week of taking my temperature hourly including rigging a data logging thermometer to my under arm for sampling temperature readings by the minute while I sleep. The results were encouraging with regards to my schedule not shifting on a non-24 hour rhythm, but I noticed my temperature wildly fluctuating. Blood work reveals a normally functioning thyroid and good health, but it appears from my readings that everything I eat is received by my body like an energy drink. Anything over 3000 calories in a day regardless of workout routine or when it's eaten just gets me amped for 24 plus hours and I have to fight against a brain that just wants to turn up and do math after an 18 hour day at 2am. Most studies I have read indicate that bad sleep leads to bad diet, but I'm finding that a mediocre diet or even a diet consisting of trying to gain muscle causes bad sleep for me (when weight training really requires 8 to 10 hours of sleep for best results). This leads me to my current tracking: my diet. I appear to be genetically disadvantaged with this combo but this could be a strength if understood. 2 months of 2300 calories a day. If I can maintain good sleep that long, this will be major good news. #DSPS #DSPD
