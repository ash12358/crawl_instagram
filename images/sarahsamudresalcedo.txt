Just finished a new site and illustration for Jane Wong (@paradeofcats). Every bit of this is influenced by her: she wanted a raccoon eating pizza, a slug, and a garden at night. It was so fun collaborating with her over the last couple of months. I‚Äôve been a fan of hers for years, so getting to find a good aesthetic for her work was a huge honor. Check it out at janewongwriter.com and grab a copy of OVERPOUR while you‚Äôre at it. #janewong #poetsofinstagram #writersofinstagram #graphicdesign #pizzaraccoon #illustration #sarahwritesanddraws

So late to the party with this incredible book. I was dubious when people said it belonged on the shelf with Lord of the Rings, but wow, does it ever earn its spot. I was reading it in the ferry and I hugged it after finishing a chapter and let out a deep sigh. A girl saw me and nodded. She had a book in her lap, so she got it. There‚Äôs nothing like a book that makes you hold your breath. #thenameofthewind #reading #bookstagram #ferry

Backyard pyrotechnics. I honestly thought we were working through today getting the yard ready for my sister‚Äôs wedding coming up, but we decided last minute to shoot things off. I‚Äôm happy we did though: in addition to getting some art done for @paradeofcats and @realvenetianblonde, I read #TheNameofTheWind for hours. SUCH a good book; I hate it took me so long to read it. Happy #FourthofJuly / #Resistance Day, everyone! #resistanceday #fireworks

Family weekend! Took Dad out for a beautiful Father‚Äôs Day hike and brunch this morning. We just passed Dad‚Äôs two year alt-birthday on Thursday (it‚Äôs what he calls the anniversary of him dying: his hard reboot), and we‚Äôre all so grateful for the extra years we‚Äôre getting with him, and so proud of how hard he‚Äôs worked to recover. Now, Claire and I are off to meet up with Emily and Mary for our sister week/Mary‚Äôs pre-wedding celebration. After the last few days with Dad and the week I have ahead of me with all my sisters, I‚Äôm thankful. We‚Äôre a complicated family, but we try and define ourselves not by the issues we‚Äôve had, but how we work so hard for the love we have and share with each. The joy of love and the hard work that it requires is a tricky balance, but I think we‚Äôre getting the hang of it. #stillteachingme #teamdoug #epicsisternerdlove #salcedosistersunite

Filming out at Tansy Point in Oregon today. Saw elk, beavers, otters, deer, and the land where the five tribes in the Chinook Nation signed the 1851 Tansy Point treaties. My favorite kind of day involves travel, hiking, and running through a field with a camera in my hand. #filmmaking #hiking #womeninfilm #chinookjustice #chinooknation #tansypoint #columbiariver #camerawoman

I started crying at 6am when I saw the news. Anthony Bourdain was, is, and always shall be a hero of mine. I‚Äôve been watching his travel shows for thirteen years and both his prose and his artistic aesthetic have had a huge influence on my own art. He went into communities with a humility that was never contradicted by his confidence, with deep empathy and curiosity, and asked questions that ceded control of the conversation to the other person. That‚Äôs so rare. So many interviews are conducted with answers in mind, but watching Bourdain you could tell he wanted his questions to open up possibilities. He found his story after exploring; not before. He truly wanted to be educated by others and knew how to sit back and listen. What a gift it was to learn that by watching his shows. His poetry, punk rock aesthetic, love of cinema and working with great cinematographers were amazing as well but man, it was his empathetic approach to his art that hit me and taught me invaluable lessons. Personally, he had been my hero for a long time for surviving himself. His darkness and struggle informed his consideration of other people‚Äôs struggles and that empathy I so admired. For some of us, every day we survive, let alone thrive, is a miracle‚Äîa war waged within and won over and over. He was honest about those battles, and that encouraged me as I‚Äôve fought my own. He‚Äôs still my hero for making it as long as he did and for the impact he had throughout his life. It can be scary waking up to find out someone who inspired you isn‚Äôt around anymore, but his lessons are still around. I‚Äôm so grateful for them and hope we can all take them to heart. This world needs more curious, empathetic people who are brave enough to explore and wise enough to shut up and listen.

Enjoying a book-filled afternoon at @eplsdotorg for the last screening (that we‚Äôre attending) until this fall‚Äôs trip taking #promisedlanddoc to the midwest/east coast. I adore this library.

I spent a day last week brewing spring vegetable and chicken stock.

‚Ä™Convinced that my dog thinks horses are just really big dogs who‚Äôve leveled up with their owners.

When I was 18, kicked out of my house and living in my van (in Tahoe, not down by a river), I pulled a Robin Tunney moment from #EmpireRecords with a pair of sewing scissors, willing all my problems up into my hair as I cut. The style doesn‚Äôt just look powerful, the process is power itself. #storytime #buzzincaseofemergency

Over the last few months I've had the privilege of collaborating with one of my all time favorite authors, Alexander Chee (@cheemobile). I designed two of his websites in 2016 as well as one that launched this year. In addition to the web design, the image posted here is a piece of art Alex commissioned in addition to the website, part of a series of art that he'll be featuring in anticipation of his forthcoming book of essays, HOW TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL, highlighting lines from the book (which you can pre-order on his site.) Illustration work makes me happy enough, but when I get to work with geniuses I admire, I'm over the moon. Thank you, Alex! #illustration #artistsoninstagram #alexanderchee #sarahwritesanddraws #artforauthors

I‚Äôm in the other room working when I hear porcelain rattling around in the next room. I walk into the bedroom just in time to see Lilo‚Äîon top of my nightstand, face buried into my mug of turmeric milk tea from last night, and her chin stained yellow‚Äî looking at me with her ears back. Clearly, she knew what she was doing and it was worth the risks. #haldipup  #guiltyface #dogsofinstagram

Just finished a new website and art commission project with @cheemobile. I love how much this landing page art (and the interior pages of the site) speaks to who Alex is and his works. We poured over five inspiration boards he put together over the last two months and found a look he felt resonated with him. I feel very lucky to get to work with him every now and then.

‚ÄúIt is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end.‚Äù Remembering #UrsulaKLeGuin today. #TheLeftHandofDarkness transformed me. #Earthsea enchanted me. The world is dimmer for the loss of her, but so much brighter for the worlds she gave us.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of you wonderful people. I had a sleepy and snowy Christmas at our place and then at my parents‚Äô house. It was also my first full day of vacation (my first in 22 months,) so the day had an extra dreamlike quality that only sleep deprivation can bestow. Looking forward to all the book reading and movie watching to come over the next two weeks. #merrychristmas #christmassnow #dogsofinstagram

Spent my birthday with friends and family, illustrating for a client, rewatching The Last Jedi, and getting really good sushi. I‚Äôm finishing my day with my birthday letters, or my League of Sarahs, where each age from ten years old until now writes about the year I‚Äôd been through, questions for the next year, and hopes I have for my heart. A few months back, I hiked out at Land‚Äôs End at dusk to reach a labyrinth perched on the edge of a cliff. It‚Äôs one of my favorite moments from this year: meditating not because it‚Äôs a labyrinth and that‚Äôs what you *should* do, but out of practicality. I was dizzy, exhausted and struggled to see my way forward. It was the perfect labyrinthine experience because it perfectly reflected the year I‚Äôd had.  I had to think about each step as the waves roared beneath me, my foot an inch from the cliff as I paced the outer rings, my head swaying as the horizon bobbed and weaved before me. Each step triggered a memory. Each memory, a lesson. I feel on the edge of a cliff right now‚Äînot in peril, but in meditation. It‚Äôs been a long year and I feel I‚Äôm at a vantage point, though I‚Äôm weary and feel ready to fall. I‚Äôm grateful for the things in my life which require me to slow down‚ÄîI‚Äôm not naturally disposed to careful action. Fatigue and sickness have been good teachers and ironically, as I‚Äôve continued to heal and get stronger physically in a lot of ways this year, I‚Äôm finally seeing how illness has taught me over the last decade, rather than fixating on what it‚Äôs taken away. So this is all going in my letter to 37, whatever birthday hikes she‚Äôll be on a year from now. Whatever wearies me then, I hope I‚Äôll remember this evening in the labyrinth. It‚Äôs okay to feel tired. It‚Äôs okay to be sore. These things can make you careful, thankful, and strong. #labyrinth #birthdayleagueletters

This week began with me in the hospital and ends with me drawing ravens in the low light of a December afternoon for a client.

A windstorm has been howling through the woods around our house since 3am. Lilo is so anxious, jumping at every broken branch that crashes against the roof. Rain sounds like gunfire against the walls and the glass panes are actually trembling against the >60mph gales. Normally, I‚Äôm prepped for storm season but with all our recent traveling, this has completely caught me off guard. I‚Äôm running around lighting candles, charging devices, and filling insulated carafes with hot soup and cider to try to get ahead of the inevitable power outage.

I don't know why (since I've been poaching for almost a decade) but I still get really proud of myself when I poach eggs. The novelty of my own late blooming patience has not worn off. #eggsontoast #organic #breakfastofchampions

My grandfather fought in WWII too. This is what patriotism looks like. Fight Nazis, don't say the issues are too complicated. Condemn Nazis in every way possible, before it's too late. We said this was coming when Trump, led by the Nazi Bannon, got into the White House. We asked liberals who were hurt by the DNC's betrayal of Bernie to think about the greater good and vote for Hillary because she wasn't a Nazi. We asked family members and friends who were going to vote for Trump to look past party and think about the soul of the nation. But people said "no." Someone died today, a person in Charlottesville who was there to stand united against the Nazis, after a white supremacist drove into a crowd intentionally. It's time to say no again, but not to party divisions. It's time to say no to Trump. On the eve of nuclear war, as Nazis Sieg Heil in the streets and the KKK takes off their hoods, good Americans of both parties must resoundingly renounce the selfishness that led us here. Call on all your reps to start the impeachment process before nuclear war begins. Tell them to demand the ouster of Nazis Bannon and Miller. We all as citizens must agree on what we're saying: No to Nazism. No to white supremacy. No to silence and complacency for the people, and a loud hell no to a President who refuses to condemn white supremacists. #resist #ifyoudontstandforsomethingyouwillfallforanything #nonazis #nazisarentpatriots #nazipunksfuckoff

Taught a bunch of amazing third graders about art and advocacy today. It was a really well-behaved class, but when I told them that when I was their age I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker and writer, they lost it. A couple girls exclaimed, "Wait, that's what *I* want to be!" like it was a shock that their goals now could be treated with that kind of legitimacy. I can't even explain how cool these kids were. They want to be good allies and raise awareness for the Chinook in Portland... I'm just so happy. What a fantastic way to start the next leg of the tour. #docroadlife #womeninfilm #thefutureisfemale #promisedlanddoc

My sister @clairesalcedo and I were talking about using second person POV tonight. She mentioned I owed her a short story and said if I used second person, it would feel like a "choose your own adventure" tale. I replied, "If I texted it to you, it'd feel like an old school adventure RPG." We immediately locked eyes and started laughing. Next thing you know, I'm downloading 8-bit sticker packs from the app store and beginning to map out the story world. So this is going down Sunday... I'm writing her a story game. She'll receive a text and start a journey... to cheesy, hilarious, magical chaos. Claire and I's love/nerdiness knows no bounds. #ruinsandrunes #epicsisternerdlove

Happy #nationalsiblingday, pet edition. Yes, I've got the world's best sisters. Yes, they're smart, funny, loyal, and lovely. But did you know our pets all came to us because of our love for each other? @emilyksalcedo wanted to get me a pet after I graduated college in 2010, and while looking at @mikeyschance shelter, we found a litter whose mother had been shot. Emily fell in love with the puppies as much as I did, and her act of love for me, adopting Lilo as my grad gift, led to her finding her dog, Penny. Mary's cat Buzz found me first. He made his home in the corner of our porch where the eaves touched down. He tried every day for a month to get inside. Vasant and I suggested Mary take him after we found her hanging out on our porch snuggling him. He's been her familiar ever since. Last to join the sibling pet pack was Frodo, who my Mom found on the side of the road the day Mary and Buzz left for Boston. We all took it as a sign that the universe was trying to make up for the loss of Mary by giving us Frodo. Frodo has been Claire's constant companion ever since. I don't know how any of us would function without these animals, or without each other. Love all seven of you! üòòüê∂üê±üíï #epicsisternerdlove

Was lucky enough to work on @anca_szilagyi's author photos last week at her desk and today around Ballard. She and @_mike_kent_, who provided excellent moral support as I twisted Anca's shoulders into awkward positions for the shoot and kept her out in the cold wind, are amongst my most favorite people: as artists, as advocates, and in the amazing and inspiring way they love each other (I don't know that I've ever seen two people more in love.) My favorite kind of work is being with people who inspire me and figuring out a way to express their ineffable aspects visually. Thank you, Anca and Mike, for letting me drag you around today!

So an inch of snow dumped on us during rush hour while we were stuck on a hill on the freeway‚Äî all in the course of 15 minutes. It went from dry ground to blizzardesque in the length of time it took to go between two freeway exits. For you midwesterny types wondering what the fuss is about: all roads here involve steep hills and practically no one has snow tires on. It's like drunk Ice Capades out here. #pnw #snow

Amazing post-film panel with Aaron Jones from the #ChinookNation and Ken Workman from #DuwamishTribe. Fantastic audience asking insightful questions, two lecture sessions at #SeattleCentral earlier, and a lunch with @magggi, one of the coolest humans ever.

Two flus in one month. I'm on day four of the more severe bout of it. Truth be told, while last week was miserable, now that I'm through the worst of it: I'm a tiny bit grateful for the excuse to watch old movies and make more of a dent in my fiction pile for the year. I haven't been this sick in about a decade and Lilo (and really wobbly legs) are keeping me from my usual "racing back to my normal routine too quick" schtick. To that end, if I owe you emails, I'm slowly getting back into my inbox, so one will be forthcoming in the next day or so... when Lilo says I'm ready. #dogtorlilo #notlapsizedlapdog

Stand for those targeted now before they come for you. Donate today to @cair_national and @aclu_nationwide, and read up on the lawsuit filed today (which just produced a TEMPORARY stay on the ban‚Äîit means we have time to advocate) by the ACLU in response to Trump's un-American, un-Presidential, viciously inhumane actions. Please don't be silent; if you don't act, you are as culpable for this evil as anyone. We're only going to avoid the end of the world if all of us, Republicans and Democrats, come together and denounce these un-American values before its too late. This man has already lead us to the brink of war: experts feel the immigrant ban will only strengthen ISIS and Iran responds to the ban by baring US citizens, a move to be celebrated by jihadists. ALL THIS and it's only been ONE WEEK. I'm terrified to think we're we'll be in 100 days. This isn't a partisan issue, this isn't typical party versus party antipathy. This is about being a good American or being a fascist. You can't be both, and you can't be blinded by a fascist who uses the flag while desecrating the ideals it embodies. You're being warned. Don't ignore it. #resistreviveriseup

Sixish months ago, Dad had a heart attack while driving. For a week and a half, we didn't know if he'd live to make it to July, let alone tonight. Despite the desperation of not knowing, after we missed Father's Day together, we realized we couldn't miss the 4th as well (fireworks are a passion of his.) So we bought a cake of fireworks for him in the summer, having faith that we'd use it, even though we knew if he made it, he wouldn't be home by early July. We set our hearts in the hope that we'd get to light these off with him before the year ran out. Tonight, wrapped in blankets, glasses full of prosecco and/or cider, our family stood outside in the cold and lit the dark up. Whatever 2017 has in store, whatever was lost in 2016: Dad was here tonight and has planted one foot firmly in the year that so easily could've been taken from him. I'm grateful. For him, for the fireworks, for my family, for all of you. I have hope that this year, we'll all find hope not just in the darkness, but because of it. Hope is brilliant in the dead of night, in the wildness of winter. I think it's the reason we have a proliferation of holidays at this time obsessed with observing small lights flickering against the long dark nights. Our hope is hard-wired into who we are as a species to ignite in times like these. Welcome, 2017. ‚ú®üçæüéâ‚ú® #happynewyear2017 #hope

Lemon bread and lemon curd recipe, based from cards written by my Grandmother in 1977 (I've made two tweaks: adding vanilla bean and Meyer lemons vs the regular kind,) detailing a Lord family treat at least five generations old. I both miss and feel closer to my Grandma Lorraine when I make this for Christmas. #lorrainelore  #grandmarecipe #christmasbaking #meyerlemon

The biggest thing I did today was break out my birthday letters. I've written one to myself, one year ahead in the future, since 1992. The first letter was written from 10 to 11 (that's how I address and sign them) informing me of how I am, what the year's been like, what I expect from the next year, who did I have crush on, who was being mean, was I an author yet, etc. I would ask questions that the next year would have to answer in her letter to the year succeeding her. I've done this for a quarter of a century now. It takes a long time to read through all of them, but it's always extremely cathartic and challenging. Nothing like a council of all your former selves asking you to hold true to who you are to make you question all with which you're currently comfortable. Life's got a way of grinding against the good until it's worn out. I want my heart to stay sharp. Reconnection and renewal are anything but gentle, but all the former Sarahs agree: the process is worth continually undergoing. #straighttalkfromtenyearoldsarah #birthdaytrailtalk #birthdayleagueletters

Worked through the weekend. One more day of work before I can let myself take time off (and that may be being optimistic on the verge of na√Øvet√©.)

Currently in hour four of a power outage. I thought I'd increase light by putting my candles near reflective things. I have triads of tapers near our tv, windows, picture frames, and in tiny glass dishes my Grandma gave me for our wedding: four votives near our tree and within the overly lacquered bookshelves we built last year. This is currently my favorite corner of this dark and cold apartment, partly because my tree looks awesome in candlelight but mostly because the greatest source of light in the room is currently being reflected from my books. It's a good time of year to remember than a sudden onset of darkness gives us the opportunity to illuminate the things that provide illumination. #happyholidays #poweroutage #blackoutmusings

I'm feverish. No voice (or rather a weak one that sounds like a geriatric cartoon mouse.) Lilo's face pretty accurately sums up how I feel inside and towards the world today.

Heading home from the American Indian Film Festival screening. Dad traveled with us, which was amazing. He had a heart attack while driving in June, and there was a huge possibility he wouldn't be alive to see the film finished, let alone travel with us. I grew up here in the Bay Area, so coming home with this film on top of being here with Dad has been overwhelming at times. I've kept so much of the emotion I went through in a box until now. It wasn't until Dad and I talked late last night that I realized how much I haven't processed through. Being with him on this trip has helped me unpack some of this summer's trauma. I went right from the month with him in the hospital to sleepless weeks finishing the film, then launching it... now the year is almost over. Dad made it. I don't think I've rolled that over enough in mind and allowed myself to breath. He's here and #stillteachingmethings. #docroadlife #womeninfilm #teamdougsalcedo

Caption indecision: "I need this root canal like I need a hole in the head" or "A Dental Bridge Too Far." I'll use both and blame my awful sense of humor on nitrous. #itsnotthenitrous #itsme #noyourinstapunsarebad #myjokesaregreat #dentist

Contact the White House. Let them know you support #indigenous sovereignty and call on the US to abide by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This is a violation. Find a live feed and tune in, keep it running in the background while you work. Let them know they are being watched and held accountable. #noDAPL #nativeamerican #water #justice

Catching up on a mountain of emails that have piled up in the last few days while I've recovered from dental surgery and a head cold that hit six hours after the drilling stopped. Sideways rain and snapped branches are hitting the window pane as the storm rolls through the area, but I've got warm soup and tea and WILL reach zero in my inboxes before heading out to film tonight. Power's holding‚Äî although threatening with foreboding flickering‚Äî but candles, blankets, and batteries are stockpiled, at the ready for when the typhoon part of this storm train pulls in tomorrow. Most importantly, the espresso is pre-ground, the camping kettle is out, so if we lose power, we won't lose good coffee. Priorities, people. If you need a cuppa, you'll know where to go. ‚òïÔ∏è#darkandstormy #wawx
