"There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living." - Nelson Mandela . Rest is key. In sports, in life, in difficult pursuits. Fitting in a moment to catch a breath enables us to tackle the thorny challenge. A few weeks ago, I rested by this pool in Tuscany. I needed it. It enabled me feel energized to dive into learning how to code and train for my half Iron Man when I got back. . How do you rest?

Vino Vero is a design forward, yet unpretentious wine bar in Venice, Italy. The ambiance drew us in. The community charmed us. They served wine, but one of them also made it too. After years of serving wine made by other people, she decided to lend her creative energy to the world. She made her own. . Ira Glass teaches us that people get into creating things because their taste is good. Then they try and their creation isn't very good... at first. There's a gap between their taste and their ability. The only way to close that gap is to do a volume of work. Set a deadline. Comit to a friend. Download the stick app and force yourself to pay a charity you don't like if you don't follow through. It's the only way to close the gap. . This is exactly what this new wine maker is doing. She started. She's closing the gap. Create something that makes the world a little better. Do it today. Make it a littler better tomorrow. Realize it might take 10 years to close the gap. Stick with it anyway because it's so rewarding seeing your creation take flight and impact the people around you. . Are you working on creating anything? How can I/we cheer you on? . . . . . . . . . . . #quote #quotestoliveby #quotesaboutlife #travelquotes #travelblogger #traveler #travelingram #travels #lovelife #carpediem #wine #winery #winemaker #lifestyle #travelandlife #travelawesome #travelphotography #travelers #traveladdict #travelbug #travellife #igtravel #luxuryworldtraveler #food #foodie #foodporn #foodlover #foodandwine #foodstagram #foodpics

‚ÄúSometimes you will never know the value of something,until it becomes a memory.‚Äù ‚Äï Dr. Seuss . I walk down this street every day on my 10 min walk to work. It's easy for routine to set in and to miss the thin slices of joy everywhere. Routine is efficient. Routine is mindless. Routine gets me to work without having to think about directions. Routine causes me to miss and be thankful for the blessings I take for granted. There are so many small moments to pause and recognize the joy to be had. They're the thin slices. Maybe only a few seconds long. A pretty view on a commute. A cool drink of water on a hot day. A dog that did something cute. I'm trying to be more mindful. To notice and hold onto these thin slices of joy a bit longer. . How are you trying to be more mindful? Any tips? . . . . . . . . . . . #nyc #newyork #lifestyle #travel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #ventureout #liveadventurously #nyclifestyle #citylife #manhattan #getoutstayout #letsgosomewhere #photographyislife  #throughourlenses #exploremore #newyork_ig #wildnewyork  #createyourhype #visualsoflife #urbanjungle #urbanexploration #urbanexplorer #urbanandstreet #urbex #urbexpeople #urbexphotography#lifestyle #exploremore

‚ÄúA mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.‚Äù ‚Äì Oliver Wendell Holmes. . It's great to be back home again after a long trip abroad. Aside from being a bit hotter, all is the same as I left it. But the lense I see it through is a bit different. Good different. More aware and more curious. Details of European influences seem to pop out. Questioning why we do things the way we do. I'm noticing things on streets I walk on every day that I've never noticed before. It's quite enriching.

It's interesting what cultures celebrate. A fight to the death. Touchdowns. Black Friday. Sleeping and eating in other countries (vacation). Boarding a plane 5 minutes before someone else.

The setting, Rome. Just outside of Vatican City. A stones throw from the well worn tourist path. We stopped for lunch. Food was great. Service was a bit slow. When I got up to go to the rest room a family shuffled in. They thought I worked there and asked for a table for four. So naturally, I grabbed them some menus, sat them down at the table by the window and ran through the specials in Italian.

I don't often wear cologne, but I bought this at the beginning of the trip in St. Remy de Provence so I could use it throughout and then remember the trip later when I use it back home. Smell is one of our strongest triggers for memory. Great idea from my brilliant wife @rianneroberts. We've also done this on trips with candles. Same effect.

I thought this was a lobby for the castle. It turns out this is the "common space" for the 4 bedroom room suite they have. We made some friends at reception and they gave us the grand tour of the castle. Absolutely incredible. Fascinating architecture, history, and style. They stored a whole collection of famous paintings here during world war 2. I'll share some bedrooms that look like they have Sisten Chapel sort of ceilings soon! - We're going to pitch our families to come back and book the suite for next year! ü§û - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #traveladdict #traveltheworld #travelphotography  #travellingthroughtheworld #travels #travelgram #instatravel #instatrip #instatraveling #travelerlife #bloggerlife #travelfreak #europevacation #europeanexperience #luxurylifestyle #luxurytravel #visititaly#letsmeettheglobe  #hexagontravel #iamtb #italia_dev #topitalyphoto

I feel as though I've moved from seeing history in Rome to living in it here. We're staying in a legitimate castle here in Tuscany. ... This isn't the main entrance by the way. This is one of the side entrances by the pool that leads up to the restaurant. ... We've slowed way down here. Soaked some sun. Let chance bump ins with other travelers and locals evolve into long conversations because they were interesting, we have no agenda to hold to, and that's a big part of why we're here. I've let my mind wander to explore its curiosities. Used a bit if reading to spark my imagination to build on by the pool.

Air B and B and Dog... actually 2 dogs, 2 horses, 3 cats, and a donkey. This is Mogley. He was very skeptical of us at first. We bacame fast friends. He sounded around the yard with gusto, herded the horses, and ran after our host literally running between chores. It's always souch fun hanging out with new dog friends. _ Some of the best sleep and most rest I've had in a long time _ Our host was so kind and industrious. She goes kitesurfing in Zanzibar twice a year. She made breakfast for us each morning. I asked her for the wifi password. She came back with a slip of paper and a pick axe. She then took out a tree that was supposedly blocking some of the wifi reception.

We all tell stories. They have heros and teach lessons. They help shape what we value.  When they're widely believed, they define culture. _ In Provence, their stories and culture prize food. Reservations are essential and the rest of the day seems to fit around those. _ A good meal, like a good play, has many acts. Ample time is made to enjoy it. The food and wine all have stories about where they're from, why they blend particularly well, and how best to pair them. Listen as the soms guide each table. One wine was made from grapes grown on the side of a Volcano 900 meters above sea level in Sicily. _ The two best meals of the trip so far were both at this restaurant. Both were deluctable through sunset. It was definitely an environment that invited savoring every bite instead of rushing through to go through the motions. _ We made friends with the staff, stayed late, and drank comped apertifs.

Don't miss the thin slices of joy. Stunning views are around every corner here. Each filled me with awe and gave me pause. It's easy to stop and take a moment to revel in the beauty. . It's also a great reminder to not miss all the other, every day thin slices of joy I experience. On a warm day, a cool sip of water. A bird singing a soft, sweet song. Running into a smiling friend. They're easy to miss. They may only last a few seconds each, but there are hundreds of them each day. . Be mindful. Search for them. Both close and far from home.

"Unless you have a reservation, we are full." They have one service. When someone takes a table, it is theirs for the night. . We evolved from hungry to hangry. The next town over was a 40 minute journey. It was a bit larger so places stayed open longer. It was our only hope to find any food. So we set off to Lourmarin. . It was quaint, historic, and charming. Art and shops. Restaurants at every turn. None that we're open though. All were full of customers, but they weren't seating anyone new. We couldn't pay for a baguette to go. None of the grocery stores or grab and go markets were open either. Aix in Provence was a big city that was sure to have something, but it was almost an hour away. Bonnieux was only 25 minutes, but was a tiny historic village, unlikely to have something. After calling lots of places with no answer, a small cafe in Bonnieux answered. They were closed. We pleaded our case. They said they'd throw together some sandwiches for us. Hope! We sped off in pursuit. The entire village was dark as we  pulled up except for this  brightly lit building. It is set on top of a hill with this view from its doorstep. The place was full of life. Locals with thick French accents. Everyone drinking pastis on tap. The sandwiches were  surprisingly delicious. We hung out, shared a glass, swapped stories into the wee hours. . On the hour drive back, we reveled in the magic of the evening. It wasn't the handmade pastas and rich sauces that made the memory though. It was the spontaneity that we couldn't have possibly planned. We also learned the importance of reservations and eating during the proper meal hours. I feel like I understand my French friends in NYC and why they like to make reservations a little better now. Glad we could come back! #travel #village #france #franceüá´üá∑ #chateau #hotel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #huffpostgram #chasinglight #socalityurbexpeople

AirBnB doorstep views. This place feels a world away from Manhattan. No trash trucks, sirens, jack hammers, or phone reception. The only noise pollution here are chirping birds. Although subtle, it's clear how taxing all of that can be when it's there every hour of every day. #lifestyle #travelawesome #travelgram #travellife #travelbug #travel #travelandlife #lifestyleblogger #lifeisbeautiful #lifestylephotography #lifestyleblog #lifequotes #liveadventurously #liveauthentic #archiecture #design

Amazon will never replace the experience of shopping for things I never knew I needed, in a 500 year old building, in the south of France, with the smell of Jazmine everywhere, with French accents carried over a warm breeze. #lifestyle #travelawesome #travelgram #travellife #travelbug #travel #travelandlife #lifestyleblogger #lifeisbeautiful #lifestylephotography #lifestyleblog #lifequotes #liveadventurously #liveauthentic #archiecture #design

What makes people happy? What is the root cause? There was a study conducted over 75 years to answer that; the longest ever done with 4 different leaders of it, passing the batton from one to the other. . They interviewed the sample, listened to conversations with their spouse, conducted in depth medical tests, and sliced and diced their wealth or lack there of. Their findings? Happiness had no correlation to their cholesterol, wealth, fame, or a 'big break'. It had everything to do with the depth and breadth of their relationships. . That means feeling known well by close friends and family and being accepted by them. It also means being known at the surface level by a community. The barista that recognizes you and asks about your week is important. Feeling alone, even with other people in close proximity, is the number one killer of the elderly. . Although an outsider, Lyon has reminded me of this. Many of the people we've met here have always lived here. We've seen few tourists (although it is the off-season) and few expats. People seem to know each other well. This aged couple were taking the most adorable, very slow stroll through trees. The congregation at this basilica in the background seemed to be a vibrant, healthy community. It seems to be a place that breeds quality relationships. . I'm grateful for the relationships I have with Rianne, family and friends. I hope and plan to be intentional and stay close, even without the luxury of all of us living in Lyon. How might we create such an environment around ourselves that also fosters such relationships? . . . . . . . . . . . . #travel #village #france #franceüá´üá∑ #chateau #hotel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #huffpostgram #chasinglight #socalityurbexpeople #urbexphotography #letsgosomewhere #getoutstayout #exploringglobe¬†#LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #travelawesome

Lyon. Apparently, the capital of French cuisine; quite a distinction for a country with 400 cheeses. Big for a villager. Small for a Parisian. You can get everywhere with a good walk, but there's plenty to explore. The bike lane sized, winding streets and hills offer a view at every turn. More cathedrals than tourists. Proud, but unpretentious. Lyon, quite the underrated gem! #travel #france #franceüá´üá∑ #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #travelgram #instagood #bestoftheday #instadaily #swimming #beach #beachlife #dog #dogs #dogsofinstagram #vacation #traveling #exploringglobe #LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #livetravelchannel #travelandlife #travelawesome #travelphotography #traveladict #travelbug #travellife #igtravel

No one has enough time, but everyone has all there is. We met a couple in London who gave us tips on what to see in the 7 hours we had to spend there on our layover. Obviously there is far more than we had time for. Whether we have hours or months the expectation should never be that we can see it all. We always have to prioritize. Balance the trade offs. Enjoy whichever path we end up on. Embrace the serendipity we could never have anticipated as the gold instead of the thorn. It seems that applies to life on the whole too. There is a lot of world to experience and we each, at best will only partake of a small slice of it. We must prioritize. We can only follow our strongest desire. Let's enjoy that slice to the fullest and let go of the impossibility of trying to do it all. We came across this trail and decided to take it, not knowing where it led. It led to floral arches, panaramic views and tranquil spaces like this. The breeze was warm and gentle. The smell was rich and natural. The sound was natural and bright. It wasn't on any tourist to do list. We passed on the Cathedral to make time to soak this in for a bit and was far more refreshing than checking something off a list. Those who love life can never see all we wish to see or do whether we have a day a week or a lifetime. No one has enough time but everyone has all there is. Let us enjoy what we stumble upon to the fullest! #travel #village #france #franceüá´üá∑ #chateau #hotel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #huffpostgram #chasinglight #socalityurbexpeople #urbexphotography #letsgosomewhere #getoutstayout #exploringglobe¬†#LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #travelawesome

"He put undergrads in a room that contained a plate of warm, fresh cookies and asked them to ignore the treats. Half the participants we're treated kindly. 'We ask that you please don't eat the cookies. Is that okay?' a researcher said. She then discussed the purpose of the experiment, explaining that it was to measure their ability to resist temptations. She thanked them for contributing their time. The other half of participants weren't coddled the same way. They were simply given orders. She didn't explain the experimentor's goals, compliment them, or show any interest in their feedback. She told them to follow the instructions. The students from both groups had to ignore the warm cookies for five minutes after the researcher left the room. None gave in to the temptation. Then the researcher returned. She asked each student to look at a computer monitor. The participants we're asked to hit the space bar every time they saw a '6' followed by a '4.' Students who had been treated kindly did well on the computer test. Despite ignoring the cookies they had willpower to spare. Students who had been treated rudely, on the other hand, did terribly. They said they were tired and couldn't focus. Their willpower muscle had been fatigued by the brusque instructions. He found that the key difference was the the sense of control they had over their experience. He's found this again and again. When people are asked to do something that takes self control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons--if they feel like it's a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else--its much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they're just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. Both groups ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower. For companies and organizations, this insight has enormous implications. Simply giving employees a sense of agency--a feeling that they are in control, that they have genuine decision making authority--can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs." - The Power of Habit

If every person on the planet lived like an American, we would need 4 planets worth of resources to support them. One of the big drivers of that is food waste. 40% of the food in the U.S. is never eaten. All of us who eat food have the ability to look in the mirror (or selfie ü§£) and be the change we want to see by doing our part by only buying food we're actually going to eat. Just some Sunday brain food I've been chewing on. #peoplescreative #liveauthentic #quote #vsco #vscocam #creativity #ideas #ideaexchange #inspirationalquotes #inspiration #hypebeast #createyourhype  #dogood #dogoodfeelgood #bethechange #bethechangeyouwanttosee #passion #quotestoliveby #quotesaboutlife #cradletocradle #environment #environmentalscience #sustainability

A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are built for. I put a monthly self checkin on my calendar to make sure I'm not making too many play it safe, comfortable decisions.

If you're going to climb a mountain, make sure there's a good view at the top. If you're going to climb the corporate ladder, make sure the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost Do you think the difference was a good difference? #peoplescreative #liveauthentic #quote #vsco #vscocam #creativity #ideas #ideaexchange #inspirationalquotes #inspiration #hypebeast #createyourhype  #dogood #dogoodfeelgood #bethechange #bethechangeyouwanttosee #bookstagram #books #passion #quotestoliveby #quotesaboutlife

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going. Take the long cut. Commit 10 years and 10,000 hours to master it. Think of it as a craft. Pursue mastery through 2 week tests and 6 month projects. Pivot as you learn about yourself and your calling. I'm a sucker for pictures of roads and trails. They seem to be a trigger for me to think of the road of life.

Problems are bad. Problems are painful, inconvenient, and vexing. Problems are good. Problems teach us to be stronger, resourceful and resilient. We become better because we have to overcome obstacles. Rock climbers strive to take the hardest route possible to the top of the mountain. They seek out problems that stretch them. These problems aren't painful, they're fun. They're an opportunity to become better. Let's not avoid the problems and obstacles. Let's find the biggest, most meaningful problems that we can make an impact on and charge towards them full speed. Even if we fail, we'll learn to be stronger, resourceful, and resilient. I'm grateful for this shot and these guys as a reminder of all this from a past climbing trip to Bishop. What are your 2018 problems you hope to solve, goals, and resolutions?

Latergram inspiration as I'm getting excited for another winter adventure next week. Walking through the Zion canyon, surrounded by towering walls with the sharp contrast between the red rock and bright white snow was truly captivating.

"Never have I trusted Fortune, even when she seemed to offer peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me - money, public office, influence - I relegated to a place whence she could claim them back without bothering me. I kept a wide gap between them and me, with the result that she has taken them away, not torn them away. No man has been shattered by the blows of Fortune unless he was first deceived by her favours. Those who loved her gifts as if they were their own forever, who wanted to be admired on account of them, are laid low and grieve when the false and and transient pleasures desert their vain and childish minds, ignorant of every stable pleasure. But the man who is not puffed up in good times does not collapse either when they change." - Epictetus, On the Shortness of Life, Life is Long if You K now How to Use it . . . . . . . . . . . ..................................... #liveauthentic¬†#letsgosomewhere #liveadventurously#polerstuff #keepitwild#wearestillwild#wildernessculture #wildme#truetothis#throughourleness #socality#solarlife#greettheoutdoors #getoutstayout#globalyodel#campthis #campvibes#vscocam#meetthemoment#makeadventure #lovethewild #VentureOut¬†#myGSOM #exklusive_shot#huckberry#NatGeoLandscape #rei #letscamp #wildernessmakesyoubetter

Nothing says happy holidays more than an entire bar decorated like a Christmas tree. This place is decked out like this year round just in case you need your Christmas fix in August when it's 100 degrees. I'm really grateful for these peeps!

A gentle snow, a warm fire and a comfy chair. A thoughtful book, an unscheduled evening, and plenty of space to think. Quite the recipe for a good time. :) "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested... People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy." - Epictetus, On the Shortness of Life #nyc #westvillage #chasinglight #vsco #vscocam #christmastree #holidays #quote #quotestoliveby #urbanjungle #photography #hypebeast #pixel2 #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype  #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #socalityurbexpeople #urbexphotography #nycprimeshot #what_i_saw_in_nyc #newyork_ig #nycdotgram #topnewyorkphoto #newyorklife #cityscape

"I believe success is achieved by ordinary people with extraordinary determination." - Zig Zigler We hiked the lemon squeeze. It immediately became one of my favorite hikes with scrambling, light climbing, a few hundred feet of ladder through a ravine, small caves, spots you can barely squeeze through and an incredible view at the top. #liveauthentic #letsgosomewhere #liveadventurously#polerstuff #keepitwild #wearestillwild#wildernessculture #wildme #truetothis#throughourlenses #socality #solarlife#greettheoutdoors #getoutstayout #globalyodel#campthis #campvibes #vscocam #meetthemoment#makeadventure #lovethewild #VentureOut #myGSOM #exklusive_shot #huckberry#NatGeoLandscape #rei #letscamp

"Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go." - Oscar Wilde I spent the day in another part of the office today and met some really interesting people that were going through a struggle but we're deciding to be happy nonetheless. It was a great reminder that happiness is a choice, not a result of circumstances. A view from where we were chatting. #urbanjungle #nyc #travel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #huffpostgram #chasinglight #socalityurbexpeople #urbexphotography #nycprimeshot #what_i_saw_in_nyc #newyork_ig #nycdotgram #topnewyorkphoto #icapture_nyc  #newyorklife #newyorklike #wow_newyork #cityscape

If the grass is greener on the other side, you can bet the water bill is higher. The contrast between the urban jungle of NYC and this one can't be understated. It's so easy to compare every aspect of life to everyone else in a city with so many people. Ironically, it's so much easier to never see grass that is greener on the other side out here. #latergram #liveauthentic #letsgosomewhere #liveadventurously#polerstuff #keepitwild #wearestillwild#wildernessculture #wildme #truetothis#throughourlenses #socality #solarlife#greettheoutdoors #getoutstayout #globalyodel#campthis #campvibes #vscocam #makeadventure #lovethewild #VentureOut#pacsun #myGSOM #exklusive_shot #huckberry #NatGeoLandscape #rei #letscamp

I've been inspired to read old things while viewing old things... "When an object presents itself to your perception, make a mental definition or at least an outline of it, so as to discern it's essential character... identify the object itself and the elements of which it is composed. Nothing so enlarged the mind as this ability to examine methodically and accurately every one of life's experiences, with an eye to determining its classification, the end it serves, it's worth to the universe, and it's worth to men. Take for example the thing which is producing an impression upon me at this moment. What is it? Whereof is it composed? How long is it designed to last? What moral response does it ask of me; gentleness, fortitude, candour, good faith, sincerity, self reliance, or some other quality?" - Marcus Arelius, Meditations This is a view from an ancient town and castle built onto the peak of a mountain. They built rooms into solid rock. People still live in homes that were built thousands of years ago. It puts the top of the line "lifetime warranty" on the roof shingles at Home Depot in perspective. It seems we in the US aspire to build things that will last at most, to the end of our lifetime. I hope that I can aspire to build something that will last for generations to come like this ancient place. #travel #france #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #chasinglight #letsgosomewhere #getoutstayout #exploringglobe #LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #travelawesome #travelandlife #travelawesome #travelphotography #travelers #traveladict #travelbug #travellife

This @airbnb served a cooked from scratch breakfast overlooking the pool and countryside. Our hosts joined us and we talked for hours exchanging stories. They used to live in a Castle and filled their home with incredible furniture from it, moved from practicing law to farming, and were relatives with Juliette Binoche. Hearing what it's like to live 5 minutes outside a very tiny French village, Cucuron, that many French people we met hadn't even heard of was fascinating. It was an entirely different world. Talking to locals like this is one of my favorite parts of traveling. #travel #france #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #travelgram #traveling #exploringglobe #LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #livetravelchannel #travelandlife #travelawesome #travelphotography #travelers #traveladict #travelbug #travellife #igtravel #jpt #luxuryworldtraveler #food  #foodie #foodporn #foodlover #foodandwine #foodstagram #foodpics

We forgot that restaurants and most everything else close on Sundays to create space for all to really relax each week. It's quite lovely unless you didn't plan ahead and were feeling very much in need of food like we were. So we found a charming market open a block away and improvised. We picked up a reputable spread and ate on the patio of our @airbnb. #travel #france #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #travelgram #traveling #exploringglobe #LOVES_FRANCE_ #TLPicks #livetravelchannel #travelandlife #travelawesome #travelphotography #travelers #traveladict #travelbug #travellife #igtravel #jpt #luxuryworldtraveler #food  #foodie #foodporn #foodlover #foodandwine #foodstagram #foodpics

The water in the Calanque en Vao was cool, crisp, and a beautiful turquoise. It was delightful to look at and even better to swim in.

The long steep hike to get here kept the crowds away from this secluded beach in Calanque in the South of France.

This Chateau just outside St. Remy made an excellent stop for a glass wine and hour d'oeuvres. We sat at an outside table, watched the sun light up the green of the trees, felt and listened to the wind blow through the leaves, and smelt the blooming flowers. We walked the grounds and took in the creek, the pool, and the old buildings that used to be used to make wine. I couldn't help but relax here. #travel #village #france #franceüá´üá∑ #chateau #hotel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #peoplescreative #shotaward #visualsoflife #exklusiveshot #createyourhype #hypebeast #visualsgang #lookslikefilm #huffpostgram #chasinglight #socalityurbexpeople #urbexphotography #letsgosomewhere #getoutstayout

Gordes is a catacombs of winding walking paths, some of which locals manage to squeeze cars through. History from the World Wars, the French Revolution, and the Crusades are all packed into the same blocks. If walls could talk, these ones would have a lot to say.

The small streets of The famous Chateauneuf du Pape were enchanting. There were very few people and hardly any tourists. We wandered the streets stumbling upon winery tasting shops on every street. The pourers would pause from their books and be happy to practice their English as they gave us free tastings and history lessons. The pace was so slow and peaceful. The restaurants closed in between meals. Everyone had time to talk. The waiters encouraged us to stay and sit for a while. Quite a refreshing change from the New York minute. #france #provence #wine #winetasting #village #urbanexplorer #urbexpeople #liveauthentic #travel #vsco #vscocam #travel #europe #europetrip #southoffrance

I can't help but settle in for long lunches and frequent stops at side walk cafes here. It's refreshing to soak up the feeling of the place and not focus on the checklist of sites to see. I enjoy listening for a mix of languages, pausing to pet dogs, taking time to talk to strangers, and sitting someplace scenic to take it in. Definitely missed some "must sees" but appreciated the city all-the-more because of it. #paris #europe #europetrip #view #architecture #arcdetriomphe #eiffletower #urbanjungle #urban #vsco #vscocam #letsgosomewhere #travel #liveauthentic #gopro #urbexpeople #urbanexplorer

You won't find any wifi out here, but I promise you'll find better connection. I had an incredible time biking around these waterways right near the Googleplex. It shocks me that somewhere that feels so removed as this could be so close to such a mega, connected tech hub. It was refreshing to reflect on on this transition.

I was on a walk, it was 77 degrees and sunny. Then within an hour, a rain storm started pouring with thunderstorms and the temperature dropped to 40 degrees. I ducked into this place to escape the rain. It was beautiful, filled with natural light, ornately decorated. The mood of the place was happy and optimistic. The cocktails were unique, and bold, crafted with the care of museum masterpieces. I ran into a group connecting about their experiences in the retail industry and I ended up picking up really valuable insights on a project I'm working on right now. They provided a unique perspective I would have never considered had I not stopped in from the surprise rainstorm. It's the type of inspiration that could only come from stepping outside the office and putting a curious mind into the world. Create space to explore and be spontaneous and you'll be surprised what you find. . . . . . . . . #chicago #chitown #bars #cocktails #vscocam #vsco #liveauthentic #architecture #speakeasy #urbanjungle #urbanexploration #urbanexplorer #urbanandstreet #urbexphotography#letsgosomewhere #photographyislife #photooftheday #throughourlenses #exploremore

"A bit of madness is key. To give us new colors to see. Who knows where it will lead us? And that's why they need us. So bring on the rebels. The ripples from pebbles. The painters, and poets, and plays. And here's to the fools who dream. Crazy as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that break. Here's to the mess we make." - The Fools Who Dream, La La Land. Rianne did a fabulous job speaking at her conference. I spent the day walking and dreaming; listening to music and exploring. I just set off in a direction and let my feet take me. Walking and dreaming are the ingredients for some of my best ideas. It's definitely one of my favorite ways to spend an afternoon. Here's to the fools who dream.

Flashback to Adweek NYC with Nigel Morris, our Dentsu Aegis Global CEO,  talking about how all companies that aren't startups today are turnarounds and need to completely change their business or risk getting disrupted because of the massive disruptive impact that digital is having on our world. President of GM's Mavens division talked about how they're building a car ride sharing startup under GM's umbrella. Fascinating stuff to be a part of. @iprospect @dentsuaegis . . . . . . . #adweek #nyc #creativity #inspiration #marketing #marketingdigital #advertising #media #agencylife #vsco #vscocam #creativeagency #liveauthentic #newyork

Had an incredible time vision casting with my team at SXSW 17! @iProspect global president, Ruth Stubbs did an incredible job articulating how she is spearheading efforts to equip woman to be productive workers, starting to generate some of the $50 B missed out on globally annually. @fuckjerry  Talked about how they're vertically integrating a media agency and a publishing platform. Other great sessions on getting large legacy corporations to pivot to adopt human centered design.

Congrats Cori and Calvin! You had one of the most unconventional weddings with a snow covered aisle, standing in the presence of mountains, and having a first skate instead of a first dance. You drew people from every corner of the country to celebrate with you and it was so much fun reuniting with this group. I look forward to seeing your journey ahead together as you collect moments instead of things.

"A mind that is stretched by a new idea can never return to its original dimensions." - Oliver Wendell Holmes. I'm constantly surprised at how strong of a tuning fork that a greater purpose can be for a community to come together. Martin Luther King had a dream, not a plan. Steve Jobs wanted to put a ding in the universe, not just sell computers. He who has a why to live for can bear almost any what. Lady Liberty is a great reminder of a purpose to rally around; our rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. #nyc #newyork #lifestyle #travel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #ventureout #liveadventurously #nyclifestyle #citylife #manhattan #getoutstayout #letsgosomewhere #photographyislife #photooftheday #throughourlenses #exploremore #newyork_ig #wildnewyork #chasinglight #sociality #hypebeast #createyourhype #visualsoflife #peoplescreative #shotaward #exclusiveshot

Happy 30th to my lovely @rianneroberts! Milestones lend perspective. They can cause me to pause and reflect on where we've come from and where we're headed.  We're celebrating genuine friendships, supportive families, meaningful work, and a constant supply of new adventures. Even so, I can't help but feel like the best is yet to come. Deeper friendships, more family members, greater mastery and impact at work and still a constant supply of new adventures. Cheers to milestones and new beginnings!

The high line was a raised railroad line that was abandoned. It was repurposed into a beautiful, intentionally designed park. I love how great of an example it is of how cities, spaces, and communities can evolve to meet the needs of tomorrow. I hope more rooftops follow suit and transform into inspiring outside spaces. It's been a great adventure exploring this with our great friends @thekatebauer @lilbauwau visiting from San Diego.

Meandering a stones throw from our new home. It's so easy to see how we've built on previous generations in this city. Concrete next to cobble stones, hundred year old wear houses converted into lofts, and the most modern new skyscrapers sharing the street with historic sites. It definitely causes me to think about how the work and efforts we toil with today will be left for the next generation. It's a constant good reminder to make decisions today that will benefit our 7th generation.

Passing some time at the Hudson hotel before moving into our apartment. I feel as though I've seen a year's worth of NYC in 2 months because of how we've been able to stay in temporary places all over the city. Not being able to get an apartment right away was less than ideal, but has been such a blessing in the end! #urbanjungle

All of the activity of Manhattan can be reduced to a horizon if you pause and go to a rooftop bar in Brooklyn. In this city, you have to find calmness not in the absence of activity and chaos, but in the midst of it. Thank you to Google for hosting this little break from the day and ordering this incredible view for us.

We've moved to NYC! So much of the world is in one place. The diverse melting pot of cultures, backgrounds, and lifestyles has stretched my view of the world in a way that a 2 week trip couldn't. This stroll through Washington park brought avid chess players, new NYU students, traveling street performers, homeless, professional couples, at least one celebrity, and scholars reading big books all to one place. I look forward to the next chapter in this new adventure. #nyc #newyork #greenwich #lifestyle #travel #vsco #vscocam #liveauthentic #letsgo #ventureout #liveadventurously #nyclifestyle #citylife #manhattan #getoutstayout #letsgosomewhere #photographyislife #photooftheday #throughourlenses #exploremore

When you fill streets that were made hundreds of years before cars with tons of cars. It makes me wonder what new technologies or new societal trends will develop tomorrow that will not fit in today's urban planning. For example, a driverless car could allow every parking space in Manhattan to turn into something else. #beautifuldestinations #travelawesome #createexplore #createexploretakeover #stayandwander #igtravelworld #islands #sanblas #panama #visitpanama #travel #igtravel #travelgram #traveling #traveltheworld #vscocam #vsco #vsconature #vscogrid #travellife #instatravel¬†#ventureout #getoutstayout #explore #traveling #traveltheworld #travelpics #wanderlust #liveauthentic¬†#letsgosomewhere¬† #keepitwild

Our water taxi stopped by this island just to give this woman a verbal message. When you don't have phones or carrier pigeons I guess you use slow fiberglass boats.

The road to the secluded San Blas islands definitely feels less traveled by. We took 480 turns through dense jungle and forest, home to Panthers and Pumas. The rains washed out portions of the road. More than a handful of the hills were the steepest roads I've ever been on. The rains made the road glisten, but also slick. Needless to say it was a 4x4 only sort of journey. The drive was incredible, lush, and definitely an adventure.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/75b99d1bde03110be5d7913d9d3d6970/5BDE138C/t51.2885-15/e35/13388680_1728457637441674_1227146861_n.jpg
We went century hoping. From the 15th century old town, to the primitive tribes in the islands, and now the ultra-modern of the Meridian in the heart of the downtown new Panama City. Overlooking the city with @rianneroberts. The city is far from perfect and polished, but that turns out to make it far more interesting.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4ffd39cffac810c807797d68ba29c566/5BE3624A/t51.2885-15/e35/13398847_254593471585415_177660867_n.jpg
Primitive natives still live on some of these islands, mostly untouched by the modern world. They stopped by in their hand carved boat to sell us things they made and tell us stories in broken Spanish. It's fascinating to think about what life would be like without the internet, Google, Facebook, smartphones, running water, toilets with sanitation, and grocery stores. They seemed to be living quite well and very happily.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/68f0c65042981f4ec45192f8e244ba00/5BDE5341/t51.2885-15/e35/13116615_116440792115234_864562873_n.jpg
Casco Viejo in Panama is one of those places you can easily wander the streets and explore without a plan. It's gentrifying so we found both very nice and very raw at the same time. There's a unique blend of Spanish, Panama, American, and Latin American cultures and influences.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0602a28643823bbf2e1c20bd12932f4a/5BE8125E/t51.2885-15/e35/13408820_133078993780273_2096807489_n.jpg
After traveling for hours past where tourists go, the motor boat dropped us off on the sailboat we chartered and left us there alone. There wasn't another boat or person in sight or even any sign that anyone had ever been there before. The first thing we did was swim to this little island. It was no bigger than a basketball court. A casual stroll took us around it in 3 minutes. It was the first time that we've ever been on an island entirely alone. It was a surreal and captivating experience.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/51cebbac00406f6af155280da5890c6f/5BD87D58/t51.2885-15/e35/13437408_1648375658737630_658097610_n.jpg
We flew for 13 hours, caught a taxi for 40 minutes, then a 4X4 for 2 1/2 hours, and then rode in this boat for 2 hours. All to get to our very own deserted islands in San Blas Panama. It was all incredibly worth it! #ventureout #travel #getoutstayout #explore #exploremore #traveling #traveltheworld #travelpics #vscocam #vsco #vscogrid #panama #visitpanama #southamerica #wanderlust #historic #liveauthentic¬†#letsgosomewhere¬†#liveadventurously¬†#keepitwild¬†#wearestillwild#wildernessculture¬†#wildme¬†#truetothis#throughourlenses

Local ceviche, cocktails with Panamanian spices, and great company at this acclaimed rooftop bar. The whole experience became magical with this panorama, cool breeze, and music.

Success in bouldering and in life is overcoming a problem on the 75th try after 74 failures. Edison tried to create the light bulb 10,000 times before he succeeded.
