Good morning at the risk of tempting fate to drop an anvil on my head all Wile E. Coyote-style it feels like a new era has crept up on me in the last couple of weeks, and it feels like a wonderful relief. The past year-ish that certainly had wonderful moments but also way too many trapdoors and punches suddenly feels far away and like I‚Äôve let go of a lot all of a sudden, leaving me more in the moment and open and sure-footed and surrendered to ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù than ever and it feels luxuriously good. Who knows how that will continue to manifest but I‚Äôm taking it moment by moment, truth by truth. (I also feel #yogaeverydamnday and #curlyhair and #fuckyeahforties are relevant for this revelation and this #365feministselfie)

‚ÄúYoga practice, both on and off the mat, opens up the heart by reviewing our patterns of grasping and inflexibility. This practice leaves no stone unturned. Through a disciplined and appropriately designed yoga practice, we not only see clearly our conditioned ways of living but we learn how to let go of those patterns so that our questions radically outnumber our answers. When we are open, and our habitual psychological and physical ways of being are suspended, we arrive in the present moment of life free to respond with an open and creative heart... Yoga is an investigation into who and what we are.‚Äù -from The Inner Tradition of Yoga: A Guide to Yoga Philosophy for the Contemporary Practitioner [#365feministselfie #yogaeverydamnday #yogini]

#tbt photo of a silly variation on Halasana (plow pose) to wish a blissful and calm #internationalyogaday to my ohmmm-ies ‚Äî> yoga has given me so much calmness, clarity, strength, and joy on and off the mat, and intentionally deepening my practice this year has been downright transformational. The next phase (making the time for 200HR teacher training plus some specialized focus around all kinds of bodies) delights me and my brain endlessly. Some days it‚Äôs a quick and familiar sequence before I run out the door, other days more challenging stuff, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade my yoga practice for anything. No way. #yogaeverydamnday

(From yesterday...) Not only is Equality Park one of the first public parks to have electric light (July 1882), but it was also the site where, in 1769, the boat Liberty was set on fire (after being seized from a colonial merchant by the British, renamed an HMS vessel and used to patrol for customs violations off the coast), one of the initial colonial acts of open aggression against the British government.

When traveling, I like to make mini-quests of finding synagogues and learning about their histories. ‚Äî> As the oldest surviving synagogue in North America and the only one from colonial times, this one is a big deal. ‚Äî> The Jewish community of Newport was established in 1658, mainly by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, and built the lovely little Touro synagogue in 1763. I arrived towards the middle of the morning service and, lacking time and proper attire, walked the perimeter of the building, hearing the beautiful Shabbat service through the open windows. ‚ù§Ô∏è

A 20-ish-year-old Anastatica hierochuntica, or Rose of Jericho, was given to me. They are like fist-sized tumbleweeds, and poikilohydric, meaning they‚Äôre able to go years without water or soil, then when placed in shallow water, they turn green and unfurl in hours. When finished, take it out of the water, and it‚Äôll close up again until it next finds water. It‚Äôs like the tardigrade of plants. ‚Äî> In some religions (Christianity, Hoodoo, Santeria) it has significance, while some people like to simply make a wish over them as the unfurl. Either way, what I‚Äôm saying here is that they are weird and good and now one is in my apartment and if it‚Äôs good luck then great game on [#nerdforplants]

Botanically named Tagetes Patula for the Etruscan god Tages, these are dopeass marigolds ‚Äî> Good companion plants for nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants) but they‚Äôll kill the hell out of legumes so plant those someplace else. ‚Äî> In a 16th century medical text of Aztec remedies (‚ÄúAn Aztec Herbal,‚Äù which is still easily findable; written in Nahuatl by an Aztec physician soon after Spanish colonizers showed up, then later translated into Latin, then translated to English in the 1930s) marigolds were a go-to treatment for being struck by lightning or to fortify someone who wanted to safely cross a river. Should you ever need that info. ‚Äî> and should you see a marigold labeled as a ‚ÄúFrench marigold‚Äù like these go ahead and read that as ‚Äúbrought to Europe by Portuguese explorers and loved by the French so they claimed them as their own‚Äù marigolds.

I sometimes think about writing a book about the role flowers and plants have played in history and power. Case in point: The middle eastern Damask Rose, named for Damascus. After the crusades, the flower began to appear in Europe as the rose of Castile (nice try, colonizers), but it‚Äôs long been widely prized for its extremely beautiful scent and is now big in bulk industrial operations for the scent industry which kinda makes me sad for them so be extra nice to these roses and smell their pretty smell and give them space and water and good soil to grow and be nice flowers.

We slide these signs into the @wgnradio studio window on Michigan Ave so passersby know to whom they‚Äôre listening and waving hello, but our new studio home is high up in a tall building across the Chicago River so who knows what will become of our signs. It‚Äôs just a piece of plastic but I remember being so excited when mine first arrived; it meant I was officially doing this job. I‚Äôll miss waving hello to little kids who stop and watch the broadcasts happen and watching civil actions and protests assemble and materialize. And when I left Chicago Tribune for WGN, the transition was easy given the two shared a building. Indeed, it‚Äôs been the best seat in the city, but the new seats are going to be pretty nice, too. ‚ÄúOnward,‚Äù as we say to each other here, a one-word solidarity, resignation, expression of excitement, and pep talk all in one.

The Chestine Gowdy peony, a cultivar said to be so named for a teacher in a single-room schoolhouse back in the day. An interesting detail about the peony is that the plant expresses distaste for being uprooted and moved by refusing to bloom for a few years. It‚Äôll come around eventually and bloom for years as long as you don‚Äôt give up on it and show it any less care during its dormant phase, but it‚Äôs all very ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt love me at my worst you don‚Äôt deserve me at my best‚Äù so mad respect to the peonies asserting their boundaries so nicely [#nerdforplants #peonies]

When I was very little, maybe three or four, I visited my great aunt and uncle, who had a little peach orchard next to their house. I have a clear memory of my great uncle, a tall man whom I thought might be a giant, making his large, rough hands into a chair and lifting me high over his head to find a magic peach. ‚ÄúMake sure you get the right one,‚Äù I remember him saying, the only way I remember his voice now. And I remember finding a big, fragrant peach, which seemed like it was bigger than my head, plucking it from the tree with its leaves still attached, holding up it high with both hands in victory as he lowered me back out of the tree. I remember waiting curiously as he inspected the peach and feeling delight after he agreed I‚Äôd found the very best peach in the world. Excitedly, thinking I‚Äôd actually found the greatest peach on earth, I ate it, giggling at how messy it was being so juicy and delicious, and then helped him pick more peaches that we decided we‚Äôd bring in and see about getting my great aunt or grandmother to make into a pie. ‚Äî> which is to say: I think about floating in the canopy of a peach tree in my great uncle‚Äôs hands every summer when I first see a mound of peaches for sale, why the first peach of the season always feels special, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm perpetually on the hunt for the perfect peach to match the best one in the world. What a gift that he lifted me up in a special quest to find it myself rather than just hand a kid a peach to occupy her for a minute. üçëüß° #nerdforplants

My friend, Kris Cohen, who is not on instagram and has a fascinating philosophy about art and technology, is doing a portrait project in which women will specifically not be asked to smile, not be asked to sit ‚Äúlike a lady‚Äù or put our ams or legs in a certain way to make ourselves small, but asked only to just *be* and sit in the space we want. Imagine that. Anyway, here‚Äôs where we started w the first of many photos and I like the content but not simple look on my face and that my elevens were not photoshopped out

Several of us went to see the still-under-construction, new home of @wgnradio today. It‚Äôs a shame to leave historic Tribune Tower and hard to imagine some near-future day on which we‚Äôll flip a switch and the signal will go quiet from the Tower after so many decades and start in a brand-new place, but with views like these, I think we‚Äôre going to be ok in our new digs across the river. And hey, an almost 100 year old radio station is bound to see some change here and there. Shoutout to Chief Engineer Bill Murdoch, in the hard hat w news anchor David Jennings, who is making a whole hell of a lot of logistics work, from walls to wires to signal antenna to soundproof windows.

Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you showing love, care, softness, desire, or vulnerability is weakness or desperation because humans have a full range of emotions that we must show, and don‚Äôt let hearing that kind of pushback make you wonder if you‚Äôre the flawed one, because you are fucking not any more flawed than the rest. ‚ú®There, I‚Äôm your damn life coach.‚ú® (Pretty collage art from a bunch of people, but appears to be sourced from @third_eye_thirst originally)

I don‚Äôt promote much here, but I put the absurd level of crap I randomly know about vintage dishes and their makers on eBay in a little shop called the-very-SEO-friendly-but-how-is-that-name-available, VintageTableware (look for green teacup icon). This is a milkglass pedestal bowl from the E.O. Brody Company, putting it from between 1958 and, say, 1964. It‚Äôs in there, along w a bunch of other stuff, if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing. I‚Äôll be adding more listings shortly, too, as the treasure trove that is my collected-under-great-discernment stash of vintage kitchen stuff continues to be mined.

Dude! Six weeks into letting my hair do its thing and embracing its natural way (swipe for first curl pic from six weeks ago. Huge difference.) I used to say ‚Äúeh, my curl is so uneven and frizzy in its natural state; I‚Äôll wait and wear it curly when it‚Äôs really long so all that won‚Äôt matter, even though it grows really slowly,‚Äù not realizing every bit of that would start to work itself out after letting it get its footing and do its thing for a few weeks. (Not to mention, whoa on being complicit and on the extremely terrible self-talk there, Guth.) But also, love to the curlqueens who share wisdom on Instagram and in person and from whom I learn and un-learn so much about curls, yes, but really about vulnerability, authenticity, too-narrow standards of beauty, and how deeply the hair and cosmetics industry is in our heads, profiting from our self-doubt. Which is to say, this is just *hair,* but it‚Äôs also about so much more than hair. And even though I thought I knew, I had more to learn and, hopefully, always will. #365feministselfie #curlyhair (LATER UPDATE: a lot of folks were asking me about this so I put everything together I‚Äôve learned about natural and curly hair care that works for me and wrote it out at amyguth.com/hair)

My laugh lines, which I am glad to have because happiness, are also giving me dimples so that‚Äôs weird and fun and I‚Äôm enjoying that and also the strange man who commented that I ‚Äúshould have some self-respect‚Äù and not post selfies can go jump in a lake bc why would I be more worthy if I shrank and hid? Yeah, not a topic up for debate. #365feministselfie #365feministselfie #365feministselfie

Here‚Äôs my silly ‚Äúomg look at this greenhouse full of plants‚Äù face today from a video shoot. But, today was somewhat significant to me bc it was the first time I went on a shoot without straightening my hair. For a long time it was said curly hair is harder to light well and gives the eye too much distraction on camera, which I internalized for years as: if I want broadcast work, it‚Äôs straight hair only. But interestingly and not surprisingly, while I wouldn‚Äôt have thought I *wasn‚Äôt* comfortable or confident in front of a camera before, I felt deeply more myself and more comfortable in front of a camera today than ever. And I watched some of it back and thought, ‚Äúoh I looked and sounded nice in that shot‚Äù instead of ‚Äúeh, good as it‚Äôll get.‚Äù That‚Äôs probably small and dumb and obvious but I‚Äôm continually moved lately by how much socialization, emotion, and how many beliefs and subtle limits, have been bound up in my hair all this time and I didn‚Äôt even know it until I decided to let my hair be extremely itself. #365feministselfie #curlyhair

1. When a blonde person in light colored clothing does this pose it looks majestic and sacred. 2. When I do this pose, given dark hair and black yoga clothes, it looks like I stuck my head someplace majestic and sacred. #yoga #yogaeverydamnday

I went very big and very small with the hammantaschen this year: **1. Cauliflower and pea samosa hammantaschen with brown rice flour pastry, tamarind syrup, tomato, mango chutney and carrot salad + garbanzo flour meat/mint bourekas hammantaschen w pomegranate molasses, yogurt-tahini sauce, hummus and lemon. **2. Giant-ass phyllo baklava hammantaschen w pistachios, almonds, dates, spices, and honey. **3. Extremely tiny apple hammantaschen w brown rice flour pastry, cinnamon and honey, bc I had a little dough left over. #purim
