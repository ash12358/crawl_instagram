Leo has finished level 1 impulse training at D&G’s and he is a completely different dog than he was 6 weeks ago. Ciara and I just ate dinner and Leo sat perfectly on the floor and  only moved 3 times. 6 weeks ago we HAD to put him in his crate to eat. Still some things to work on but we’re very thankful for Janet and her staff! We can’t wait to see what he’s like after level 3! If you are in the Wilmington area with a pup or a dog who needs training...don’t hesitate to go to D&G’s! #LeoMcGee #GSD

Mrs. McGee is as fierce a teacher as she looks in this picture! She is constantly working hard at all hours of he day and night to make sure her students get the education they need and deserve. And I do mean ALL hours. Simply put...she cares for every student in and outside of her classroom. She leads by example with her professionalism, talent, and toughness to get through the hardest of circumstances. Every time she passes with flying colors. I am one proud husband of a teacher. Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay! Now...where is my buy one get on free chipotle? 😂😘❤️

My dad always coached me growing up. One time I shot a 3 from the tip off after a teammate passed me the ball. Of course I made it 😏 but I started showboating down the court. My dad immediately called a timeout and benched me for my antics. Along with helping me grow in my faith, demanding that I act like I have some sense has made me a better man, husband, and overall human. The respect I have for my dad is off the charts and being married for one year now, I appreciate more what he did and continues to do for his family. Happy 60th birthday, Dad! I’m still trying to figure out how at 60 you have a full head of hair and I have last mine 🤔 So salty about that 😔

‪My family celebrated the life and home-going of my grandpa Pop today. He was a tremendous human. Always loving, caring, and supportive to his family...especially his grandchildren. We’re grateful that he was able to get better and for the time we spent with him before he passed away. He was a quiet man but lived a loud life for Christ. That’s why my family mourns today but also can find joy because we know we will see him again! I love you Pop! RIH ‬

The Caribbean was beautiful but it doesn’t compare to the beauty of my wife! You can ask me how the honeymoon went or you can just look at this picture that basically sums up how we felt towards each other the entire time. You’ll hardly ever catch me saying I/we deserve something, but we deserved this time together. I love my wife so so SO much! More pics, videos and stories to come!

If you’ve ever seen the movie The Wood..that’s how we’d describe our friendship. Zo would be Slim, Tmac would be Mike and I would be Roland. 😂  There are very few days that go by that we don’t communicate. Real and genuine friendship doesn’t grow on trees. When you have it...appreciate it. Appreciate the this lifelong brotherhood! 💪🏾💯 Majorrrr #TBT

Trevor has been my dude since high school. It’s hard to pick a favorite memory but the time he was a best man in my wedding and had to help me with the garter toss is up there! 😂 I appreciate his friendship.

Ciara and I are excited to welcome our new puppy to the family! You can call him Leo but his full name is Leonardo Stormborn of House McGee, First of his name, The Unfazed, King of the Shepadors and Maple Ridge, Armond of the Great Grass Yard, Breaker of Leashes and Father of Warriors. He will no doubt take his rightful place on the Iron Throne one day! • • • #germanshepherd #Labador #shepador #labmix #puppies #dog #IronThrone #LeoMcGee #Leo #Leonardo #HouseMcGee #gameofthrones #adapt #humanesociety

Big shout to the big bro on his birthday. One of my best men at my wedding, he was a literal shoulder for me to lean on. It meant the world to me that he picked me up the day of and made sure his little bro was straight for his big day. No matter where I was throughout the day..I knew he was close by making sure I was good and I'll forever appreciate that. I'll also always appreciate him showing me my first mob movie in high school. In our previous life, we were no doubt connected to the  Corleone family and or Jimmy Conway in some way. Much love to the original T MAC!  #GrandeFratello #LaFamilia • • • #bestman #groomsmen #weddingphotography #bigbrother #family #thegodfather #goodfellas

On a day that was all about Lex and Tim, they surprised me and Ciara by putting the spotlight on us for 4 minutes and 52 seconds as they wanted to honor our marriage by letting us share our wedding first dance again. They also allowed us to walk into the reception together..both of which I was unable to fully do with my wife on our own wedding day 7 months ago. We've danced to our wedding song 3 times. The first time was 2 days before our wedding in the hospital as part of my rehab to see if I'd be able to stand up and dance for the length of the song. The 2nd time was 2 days later at our wedding. The 3rd time was when the DJ called me and Ciara to the dance floor at Lex and Tim's wedding to do it one more time. When we realized what was going on it was very overwhelming. The first dance at our wedding was beyond amazing but I've always wanted to do it feeling better and I was given that opportunity. Ciara and I are extremely grateful for it. It was actually therapeutic for us. We're still on cloud 9 about this tremendous act and selflessness and devotion shown to us. All the hugs and tears will never fully convey how much this meant to us...and there have been a lot of both since this. Words can't do this feeling justice. I've watched the videos of this dance at least 30 times. My body is not in this moment anymore but my mind and soul are. In spite of everything we are extremely blessed to have a tremendous support system by our side through whatever life throws our way and the gesture from our brother and sister is a prime example of that. We love Lex and Tim more than anyone will ever realize and will be thanking them for this for the rest of our lives...we mean that! The newest version of the McGee Widerhold bond is unbreakable and stronger than ever...like it always has been! • • • #wedding #firstdance #barnweddings #love #family #groomsman #matronofhonor #summerwedding #happy #marriage #newlyweds #weddingphotography #surprise #thankful #grateful

One of my favorite displays at @rockhall was the 50 years of iconic @rollingstone covers. It's hard to choose a favorite but for some reason I find that #Adele cover fascinating. Also #Tupac, #Obama, and #Prince are captured perfectly. #RollingStone is the only reason why I can use all of those people in the same sentence. #RS50

32 years of being #married for my parents and a solid 3 months for my wife and me. What a great example of a #Christ-centered marriage we have as an example from both sets of #parents.

It's hard to find real #friends these days. We all have friends but how many real friends do we have that would go to battle with you when you need them..no questions asked? You know the expression "He's not heavy he's my #brother"...to have 10 #men demonstrate that to you from the bottom of their heart when you need it the most is overwhelming and a feeling I will never forget. Words cannot describe how #grateful and #thankful I am for these men. I have so much genuine #love for them all! #wedding #groomsmen

To my wife, I knew after our wedding I would love you more than I ever have in my life. But after the week we endured leading up to our wedding, my love for you is greater than I ever thought it could be and I know our love is stronger than ever because of it. Thank you for being my rock and support system through the toughest time in my life. Thank you for making our wedding a reality. I am so beyond thankful that God placed you in my life and that you love me unconditionally the way you love me. God knew exactly what I needed in a wife and that is without a doubt you. I'd also like to thank my family, especially my mom dad brother and sister for being by my side every single day last week. Also, my mother and father in law Tina and Chip, Sister Lex brothers Seth and Kaleb and soon to be brother Tim. You all are amazing and kept me strong all week. I can't thank you enough for your love and support. To the entire #NYEMCGEE bridal party, thank you for understanding and being there for my wife and me all week..especially on Saturday! I am so overwhelmed with the love and support from all of our friends and family. I am truly blessed beyond belief. My wife and I cannot thank you all enough. Please continue to keep us in your prayers. We are firm believers that God is so faithful and we will continue to trust in Him every single day of our life..no matter what life has in store for us individually and as husband and wife. By the way, in case you were wondering, I am so loving being married to this beautiful woman. What a tremendous blessing from God!

Today, my little sister moves into college. I'm not sure where the time has gone. She is tremendously smart, having graduated from high school at the age of 16 and now she is heading off to @cedarville. It's been awesome seeing her grow into a young lady. I can't wait to see what the future holds for her, I know it's something great! Love you so much Syd and always remember! (You know the rest). 😊

My great-grandma celebrated her 100th Birthday this week! Today, my family threw a surprise birthday party for her. She is a literal living legend. If you've haven't heard me talk about her before, she was instrumental in the Civil Rights Movement on a national level. She is awesome and I am so blessed to call her my great granny. And let's be honest...she doesn't look a day over 78! Love you so much great granny!!

A very special shout-out to my fiancée @ciaramichelle_2. Today, she wraps up her first year of teaching as an Early Childhood Pre-K Intervention Specialist. I am so very proud of her for the work she is doing in the lives of young students in the #community. It's honestly been a joy spending hours in her #classroom or at her apartment cutting lamination for her lesson, carrying heavy things to the dumpster for her, being her Guinea pig for the upcoming weeks lesson and being there to provide comedic relief during the long stressful hours. She doesn't get the credit she deserves for her hard-work and dedication to her 20+ students, school, and school district. I'll miss all of her students...I feel like they are mine too! I can't wait for the new crop of students to call her Mrs. McGee next year! 😊😉😜😏 - ❤️ You!! #WCW #NYEMCGEE #NoFilter

Posting this throwback of my parents in honor of their 31st wedding anniversary! I've been tremendously blessed to grow up in a home with two parents who first and foremost love the Lord and secondly love their children unconditionally. Not a day goes by that I take this for granted. Since I am getting married this year, I appreciate the model of marriage these two have set before me more than I ever have. I hope that my marriage can model Christ and the church in the way my parents have. Happy Anniversary! I love you two so much!

This is my amazingly wonderful GREAT-Granny. She turned 99 this week and she is full of energy and life. She also has an incredible story. Every day for two years in the 1950s, a group of black mothers and their children marched to the all white Hillsboro, Ohio elementary school only to be turned away every time. My Great Granny, Elsie Young, was one of those mothers. Her fight and determination for justice and black equality, however, changed history...literally. The Hillsboro Elementary School march started by my Great Granny and five other mothers became a test case for the Brown vs Board of Education decision in 1954 which established separate but equal public schools as unconstitutional. I am beyond blessed and thankful to call this pioneer of not only American history but of the faith my Great Granny! I love her so much! Happy Birthday Great Granny!

I share a unique relationship with my dad because I'm a PK (Preacher's Kid). I've seen him work hard on a 9-5 and I've seen him work extremely hard to advance the kingdom of God. He not only sets an example for me on how to be a man...but more importantly he sets an example for me on how to be a man of God. He challenges me every day to build a personal relationship with God by displaying the love of Christ in his own life. His desire and heart for God inspires me. I strive daily to be a man of God like him. I'm beyond blessed to call him father. #FathersDay

This picture is perfection. Made dinner for @ciaramichelle_2 tonight and watched a movie.

I read the first two books right before the movies came out. Time to read the final installment. I've got some reading to do before Nov. 21! #Mockingjay

Happy Birthday to my little sister who isn't little anymore! Someone please tell me how she is already 15 because I don't know where the time went!

Happy Birthday to the one and only @tigercline. He is not only my friend...but my brother. It's only fitting that he is also my little...because he is the closet thing to a twin that I have. The Kappa Sigma Fraternity has made us brothers for life, and I could not be more happy about that. Hope you have a fantastic day and let's celebrate soon! Much love brother! #AEKDB

The system did not plan for this. #ANOMALY is NOW available. Highly recommend listening to @lecrae's new album.
