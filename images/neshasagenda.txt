So @Forbes reached out to me about a series they wanted to produce featuring women who are defying the odds and redefining what it means to be a woman in business. The editor told me my name came up immediately and a few weeks later it was in the works. The article is out NOW! Read it here bit.ly/forbeslife. (link in bio if you’re on IG reading this) ✨✨ Special thanks to @theglenlivet_us, @womenatforbes and of course the team that helps me shine in front of the cameras @memacreations on makeup and @christinenicholson__ on styling. 🙌🏾🙌🏾 #ForbesLife #HerAgenda #Ouchea

“Put it on ice, celebrate that we made it, I put it on Christ...Lord knows it takes hella patience...” ::Bey voice:: ✨✨ I’ve been holding this news as long as I possibly can but can’t hold it anymore. I’m in the July/August issue of @ebonymagazine! I didn’t want to share until I actually found a physical copy on newsstands but I still can’t find it. 😫 If anyone has the plug at Ebony please send me one (or ten). 🙏🏿 So grateful for this honor, and even more grateful to the @heragenda team. We continue to tell the stories of powerful women and lower the barriers for women across the board with our platform. Inspiration, information, and access to opportunity all in one place. If you don’t already follow our work @heragenda ♥️🙌🏾

To achieve against all odds requires another level of persistence, preparedness that is not for the faint of heart. And when that persistence meets purpose, the result is undeniable. Incredibly honored to know this woman and have the opportunity to share a piece of her story with @womenatforbes in my @forbes column. Nailah Ellis-Brown you are incredible!

Never in a million years would I have thought that the places I read about in the Bible growing up would be places that I’m able to say I’ve been to. I’ve been to Israel twice but on this occasion was the first time I had the chance to take a dip in the Jordan river. This is where Jesus was baptized. 🙏🏾

Quick stop @syracuseu last night. It was a special full circle kind of moment because my mentee @diasiaglo is now a SENIOR (graduating in a few weeks!) and she started out interning for @heragenda while she was still in high school (hmmm where have you heard that before?). So proud of her! And grateful for the chance to speak to all the students there about hustle, media, and entrepreneurship.

My birthday has me feeling nostalgic. These interviews are from 2011. I used to always interview artists. More so new and up and coming artists that I identified as on the verge of blowing up like @bigsean, @realcoleworld, @charleshamiltonmusic Etc. So many lessons learned during that phase. Lots of hustle, and also clearly learned to never shoot in front of a window 😂😂. All these interviews are still up on YouTube.

I’ve really been doing this work since I was 16. I’m so lucky. First photo is me at a program for teens I was part of called #HarlemLive. We ran an online newspaper. It was innovative at the time because the internet as we know it was just beginning. The year was around 2005/2006. Fast forward (swipe) a few months ago in my office, still publishing content, still doing what I am meant to do. The funny thing is, anyone who knew me as a kid will tell you I was quiet and shy. I am not the center of attention, I don’t like to speak unless I have something meaningful to add to the conversation so a lot of the time especially around other kids I simply observed. Discovering journalism really pushed me out of my comfort zone and I haven’t looked back since. #birthdaypost #itsmybirthday #imworkingonmybirthday ♥️

That feeling when your birthday is TOMORROW! Entering the last year of my twenties. What I love about my life is the fierce community and tribe around me. I learn from you all directly and vicariously from afar as I watch you evolve. So I would love any advice or words of wisdom from YOU as I step into 29.  That would be such a gift. ✨♥️ #DropAComment #AdviceBelow #OrTextMe #LoveYou ⭐️ 📷 by @photosbyrome

Yesterday’s agenda was busier than normal with a live segment and a few big pitch meetings. Today I’m back in the saddle, aka at my desk but grateful for moments like yesterday. Appreciate @mashable + @ubs for giving me a platform to speak my truth and shine a light on important issues. It really is simple. Invest in women, pay us what we’re worth. 💰(video link in my bio in case you missed the segment!)

“For me there is comfort in acknowledging that my success is not just my own -- it is for women and people of color who were equally talented but were denied access to opportunities and shut out of these these spaces in the past. It’s also for those who will come after me because I was brave enough to be the one to take a seat at the table or create a new table for all of us.” Thank you @fortecornell for having me as the featured guest in front of incredibly talented and ambitious students. I am so impressed by your drive and ambition. 🙏🏾🙌🏾 And behind the scenes it takes a village. Thanks to my speaker rep @glenda_nicole & @rue107 for the 👗.

Today I had the opportunity to speak in front of a group of students @princeton_university. Loved their take on Black Love and entrepreneurship. The concept wasn’t around romantic love but love of self, and love of what you do and turning that love into the confidence to produce a product & create a company. We talked self care, building a team, networking and failure. Also, inside I am like....OMG, I’m on Princeton’s campus during #BlackHistoryMonth! 🙌🏾 🙏🏾

Allow me to re-introduce myself. . . I haven’t actually formally done any introduction on social since I started my online presence in 2003. I started my first blog in 2005. Today, I am a journalist and entrepreneur who founded a media platform called @heragenda where our goal is to bridge the gap between ambition and achievement for millennial women. We do this through content, community and events. I’m passionate about the power of reporting, and storytelling. I’m fascinated by the impact media has on our perception of the world and in turn the world’s perception of us. For the next phase of my company I’m looking to harness that power for good by partnering with companies who care about hiring from a diverse and qualified candidate pool. The way we are thinking about this is a bit more nuanced and I can’t share it all here but if any of this interests you, or someone you know reach out to jobs@heragenda.com and let’s chat. ♥️ . 📸  @photosbyrome

More to be done but grateful for these milestones along the way. 2016 was the lowest point in my life and then 2017 showed up and the back to back blessings were beyond my imagination. All I can do is thank God and continue to make an effort to pay it forward. It’s bigger than me. Let’s all continue to grow and pour into each other in 2018 and beyond. ♥️🙏🏾 #happynewyear

Just announced the winner of the @heragenda x @raymourflanigan #hersanctuary giveaway. Such a blessing to be able to help one of our readers create a home for her and her siblings. Her strength is beyond inspiring, after losing both parents in a horrible tragedy at the age of 18 she’s now 23 and taking full responsibility for her siblings. They haven’t had a place to call home in the last 5 years. Read their story on @heragenda. #RFpartner

Thank you @lilly_works for your thoughtful questions. This talk was titled WHAT MOVES YOU? We spoke about career ups and downs, failure, @heragenda and how the arts and dance impacts my life. Not many people know I used to dance as a kid. I was in ballet class and had two left feet. The choreographer/teacher yelled at me and literally made me cry in front of the class. But the tough love was needed. I became better in the end because of it. I did the work needed behind the scenes so that wouldn’t happen again and it paid off. It’s an experience I took with me into my life, career and ultimately entrepreneurship.

Honestly I wasn’t ready for the difficult path I chose but I still made it through. It’s not because I didn’t want to give up. It’s not because I didn’t feel tired. It’s not because I climbed effortlessly without hesitation. I hesitated. I gave up. I was exhausted. I complained. But I still made it to the top and back down to the safety of the earth. Why? Only because of the group. The mini tribe around me who didn’t even know me wouldn’t let me quit. Grateful for all my tribes who never allow me to quit.

This experience was truly life changing. Back in March I had the honor of going on a leadership development experience in Israel. With the history and legacy of the land that is now Israel as a backdrop we were challenged to evaluate ourselves, our values and our reality. #MyReality is forever changed because of @realityisrael and so many former strangers I can now call family around the globe. @lilly_works @deeptinyc and @raeana you should apply! ❤️ #shabbotshalom #fbf #30under30

Media is powerful. Ever take a moment to think who is at the helm of those platforms? More often than not they don’t look like this. But we exist. @heragenda @bleumagazine @blavity and @crwnmag are all media companies run by Black founders. We came together to have a discussion about what that means and the state of the industry.

“Too often, Black women have to prove the impossible before they are able to secure an investment whereas there are many other startups that secure a check simply based on an idea (with no proof), or simply based on the reputation of the founder. Don't dismiss us, don't just give us advice, set us up to win. Invest in us, and help position us so that billion dollar companies helmed by Black women can become the norm.” - - Read the rest of my interview with @ESSENCE on their site & check out the full #ESSENCE50 list >> https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/entrepreneurship/rhonesha-byng 📸 @kidzrevil <link in bio 💁🏾>

Really and truly I could cry 😢 and I don’t like to get emotional. I’m beyond honored to be part of this list of founders featured in the November issue of @ESSENCE magazine! It’s my first time ever being mentioned in print for my work with @heragenda. I started @heragenda from my dorm in 2008 as a college student. I began to run the company full time in 2015. It wasn’t the typical journey for a startup founder but it’s the one that worked for me. Grateful to be counted among so many friends and familiar faces! I see y’all!! This is an incredible list. Get the November issue of @ESSENCE to learn more about these dynamic women. Thank you @vanessa_kdeluca ❤️ for all you do for Black women. #HerAgenda

Hi @linkedin 👋🏾 - - Super crazy...I got the chance to do an in studio session with #linkedinvideo talking about my company, and what I’ve learned as I built my career. I had a LinkedIn page since I was 16. My mentor told me - sign up for this platform. I’m like what is this? It looked boring and like a lot of work because I didn’t have a resume. And now look. _ - 💄 @memacreations Styling: @es_py_b #styledbyespy 🔌 @jon__jackson

Mood. This little one was the star of the ER last night. Smh. Glad she’s okay. But frustrating that they run all these tests and can’t tell you what’s wrong. We could have stayed home for all that. 😫 #sheREALLYneedsajobnow #sheowesmesleep #hireher

When I moderated @blackinadvertising’s thought leadership panel last week, I said that more positions of power in advertising need to look like the faces in that room. The recent racist Dove ad is just one one the many reasons why. We are culture, invest in black and brown talent, don’t just chase our wallets.

Seek knowledge. Be relentless in your pursuit of opportunity. The resources are out there. Some people are off work tomorrow but as an entrepreneur those days simply mean less emails and more time to focus on the work. Let’s get it!

On stage at the @forbes #under30summit @womenatforbes MIT take over chatting about if we (women) ruled the world. The funny thing is we do but we just don’t get the credit.  Women@Forbes thanks for the opportunity. Women have always been at the forefront doing the work — the invisible work that keeps everything running. It’s time to shift that. Value women, invest in women, pay women and reward them for their ambition.

Through my work as a journalist, I get to ask questions for a living. But as a little girl, I was often called nosy. ‘Why?’ and the infamous ‘how come?’ were a regular part of my vocabulary. I was the one who did well in school (even though to be honest I didn’t enjoy it). My name appeared on the honor roll every semester and I eagerly raised my hand to answer the teacher’s question, every time. I prided myself on knowing the answer to the questions asked of me and getting it right. But there was one major question I did not know the answer to: what do you want to be when you grow up? - - In my latest column for @womenatforbes I share the three simple questions that defined my path.

My latest column for @womenatforbes dives into the complexities of opportunity and success for Black women and the added pressure we feel. Yes, when one of us wins we all win, but the flip side of that is what happens when we fail? Is there room for Black women to fail? Obviously this is not for every single Black woman but it's a consistent and popular narrative. I'd love for you to check out my piece featuring the perspectives of four accomplished women @luvvie, @vanessa_kdeluca, @candicesc1of1, and @taibeau.

On tonight's panel I shared a bit on the pressure for success that young women often feel. Sometimes that pressure isn't simply because of the desire for personal achievement, or ticking off a box. Sometimes that pressure comes from the need to succeed as a form of resistance. It's almost like a responsibility we feel because we know when one of us succeeds it sends a message to society that yes we are capable. This pressure is even more intense for women of color (for too many reasons to list here). So keep pushing. Keep striving. Keep hustling. It matters. 💕

"No one slows her, not even me. When we board the train it’s a struggle finding seats next to each other. I’m willing to settle, thumping my bags down between the first two seats that face one another. But Nesha, New Yorker to the core, pushes on. “I’ll see what I can find,” she tells me, before disappearing into the cars ahead. Moments later, she texts me: Seats! And so I follow. “I want to hear you,” she says, as I reach our seats two cars down the line. And me, I need to hear her to learn what she’s up to now, next, and how she gets where she’s going so quickly." 📝 by @chiareality Read the story here: http://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/33194/ <link in bio>

I don't even know what to say, honestly. Thank you so much @depauwu for this incredible spotlight. Cannot believe my alma mater chose to not only tell my story but place me on the cover!

It was such an honor to join 100+ global speakers on stage at the first annual @haititechsummit17. I moderated the closing panel with my Forbes 30 Under 30 family. It was fitting to close the summit with that panel because the entire team who planned and excuted the summit were all under 30. People told them it was impossible but lo and behold it happened. I interviewed the founder, Christine Souffrant Ntim about the process and how her and her team pushed through to make it happen.

Today, July 31st marks the acknowledgment of #BlackWomensEqualPay Day. The day was chosen because of the symbolism. In order to earn the same amount that a white man earned in 2016 we need to put in an almost 8 months of additional work. That's how wide the gap is. You can learn more about this issue on @heragenda.

The topic was impact investing + finance. It was a complete coincidence that we each showed up wearing a shade of green. #wealthsquared 💚

This Saturday, join me and @dominiquebroadway for brunch + a fireside chat about #ImpactInvesting. We will share personal stories – both our successes and failures – along with key insights that can make a difference. We will also discuss how your investments can make a statement about who you are and what you believe in. We will address the exponential sense of accomplishment that comes with supporting the causes, passions, communities and companies we believe in. So, in this way, we not only nurture our bank account, we also nurture ourselves and our communities. RSVP: http://www.rhonesha.com/speaking/ <link in bio>

God. Goals. Grind. Your goals don't care how you feel. If you let your feelings dictate your agenda you're not going to achieve. Keep pushing while taking time to pour into yourself so you can continue to grow. (Yes, self care, taking breaks and recharging are part of the grind. You need it to refuel). It's simple, do the work. Show up. Take the meeting when you don't feel like it. Follow up. Pay attention. You're #MoreThanCapable, remember that.

Full circle moment. I was a @seventeen magazine real girl model. This happened back when I first fell in love with media. I was 17 at the time I modeled for them. Tonight, over 10 years later, the former EIC of Seventeen was sitting next to me on a panel hosted by my company @heragenda. Life will really take you places if you do the work and keep pushing. #HerAgendaLive 📸 by @lou_dynamite

They say you should never be the smartest person in the room. I'm so lucky to be invited to stages and summits where I get the opportunity to learn from others. The first annual #haititechsummit was one of those moments. Some of the biggest names in tech and entrepreneurship were in the room (including the legendary #BenHorowitz). - - I moderated the closing panel and I got the chance to chat on stage with my @Forbes #30under30 fam. They're incredible in so many ways. Adam Lyons dropped out of h.s. at 15 years old and today his company has raised 23M in venture funding & employs 70 people. Nailah of @ellisislandtea is currently all over MSNBC and just signed a deal with Sam's Club. She started selling tea out of the back of a trunk and today has her own factory in Detroit. This only scratches the surface of their stories. But the takeaway is keep going no matter what, and it is possible to turn your obstacles into strength. 🙌🏾

Woke up to this great piece that essentially says book more Black women speakers because they're amazing. Shout to @geeniebox and @google for the platform. - - The column published a suggested list of 28 black women to start with in case folks need some inspiration (and if you look at most conference agendas there's a lot of people out there who need inspiration). - - From the column: "...we have attended six events featuring successful black women as speakers or panelists. But what has been even more impressive than the growing quantity, is that with each event we attended we realized that the quality of these presenters is exceptionally high. Black women face well-documented adversities, ranging from socio-economic hurdles to unconscious bias and discrimination. What we heard from many of these presenters is that they have used adversity to fuel their determination, hone their talent and build their resilience. And now they are using their success to raise their visibility, share their experiences and inspire more black women to take up the challenges of leadership."

Never be satisfied being the only one in the room. As a Black woman I feel a responsibility to hold the door open and uplift others through the platform I'm blessed to have and the opportunities that come from it. Honestly I consider it a privilege to be able to do it. Always push and ask who else can I bring?

Now known as the Stone of Anointing, this is said to be the place where they prepared Jesus' body for burial after he was crucified. 🙏🏾#ressurectionsunday #realityisrael #heisrisen

The tomb is empty. He is risen. Still surreal that I've visited the place that was once Calvary to see this Holy site with my own eyes. The tomb is enclosed by an 18th century shrine at The Church of the Holy Sepulchre. #realityisrael

Wake up. Today visiting the border of Syria brought the conflict to reality. I heard gunshots and bombs. But the benefit of @realityisrael is that I have context. Grammar aside (too*) the message is clear.
