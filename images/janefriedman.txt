This is a beautiful personal essay in The Point (@thepointmag) about being a Quaker but also being unable to be a Quaker. Haunting and makes anyone with a heart question what they value most of all - and what happens when you realize maybe those values aren‚Äôt what you once hoped or wished for yourself. By Sarah Ruden.

My former F+W colleagues will appreciate this one. I started training for a 5k and suggested to Mark (@chespo) that he could also give it a try - his first race. I found a 6-week audio training program for beginners and wrote down the schedule on this calendar sheet. We‚Äôre both about 2 weeks into the training and also flying to Vancouver tomorrow. He has a scheduled training session that day that I figured he‚Äôd have to skip - we‚Äôll be on planes all day. But he said he‚Äôs heading to the hotel gym after check-in. Why? Because that‚Äôs the schedule. A production manager ALWAYS RESPECTS THE SCHEDULE. .... Now I have all kinds of ideas about how to get what I want. üòá

I attended BEA about 10 years straight, during what in hindsight feels like the apex of trade publishing. Now returning after a couple years away, it feels like the incredible shrinking trade show - not even the rights floor is here any longer. Ingram takes up a huge swath of the show footprint.

Runner‚Äôs World recently ran a cover story about how to become an early morning runner, touting all the benefits and usual BS you hear about early risers. Let me tell you, once I let go of all the guilt related to the hour I roll out of bed in the morning, I became instantly happier. That‚Äôs how I #competewithmorningpeople üí•‚òïÔ∏è

I recently read a profile of Ryan Murphy (fellow Hoosier), who is one of the producers of the People vs. OJ Simpson (American Crime Story series). So now I‚Äôm watching, and I‚Äôm mostly in awe of how Marcia Clark was able to survive that trial without having a nervous breakdown.

Today I saw my PT person for the first time in two years - not necessarily because anything is wrong, but because I‚Äôd like to avoid ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in the future. Working with her has been an eye-opening experience of understanding pain and healing - not to mention realizing the deeply problematic approaches in traditional health care when it comes to multi-faceted, complex issues such as chronic pain, back pain, and women‚Äôs health. Long story short, I‚Äôm lucky to have found the right therapist where I live.

Every time I find myself with a Pinot Noir, I think of Paul Giamatti‚Äôs character‚Äôs iconic monologue in Sideways where he talks about the sensitive little grape as a way to talk about himself. And how that scene completely changed the market for Pinot Noir and also Merlot (the latter which he denigrated). And I think of how everyone has been weirdly Pied-Pipered into liking this varietal so much in the US, to an annoying level. But this bottle - this one I‚Äôd get again. How‚Äôs that for a recommendation?

Today at #lvwc18, conference organizer @jennyballif offered a wonderful (true) tale of two writing groups: a successful one with a mindset of perseverance and another with a mindset of pessimism and eventual defeat. It starkly illustrated how writers are often their own worst enemies - they don‚Äôt allow room to grow and improve, they just close up shop after a few rejections. The game is so psychological - never forget it - and I even have to remind myself of that.

Okay, last #Ottolenghi food photo for a while. This is the rice salad with nuts and sour cherries from PLENTY MORE. Another wonderful find - and vegan.

I cooked the cover of the #Ottolenghi cookbook JERUSALEM. Fantastic, will be making for years. It did require searching for a jar of preserved lemons, as we did not want to wait 4 weeks to make our own. #cookthecover

This is an excellent book that I keep recommending to clients. If I were still at Writer‚Äôs Digest it would totally be on the acquisitions list. Only available in print, not digital format. Been nudging the author to rectify that.

We‚Äôve been very loyal Blue Apron customers for a while now, but in February, we received notice that our wine shipments would be suspended until further notice. I don‚Äôt think we entirely anticipated how lost and heartbroken we would be without this service. We‚Äôve now survived two months without our regular delivery of six 500-ml bottles. In an Easter miracle, we received word that the shipments would resume in May! Happiest thing all week. Perhaps this demonstrates either how much we are hermits or how much we enjoy the small things in life. üç∑‚ù§Ô∏è

In 2012 I moved to Charlottesville for a new job, which was a big enough change, but on top of that I also started cohabitating with @chespo, Casey, and Baxter. It was a rough first year, especially for my cat Zelda, who was sequestered on the second floor until an animal truce was reached. Eventually Z became affectionate toward Casey, who tolerated her attentions. Today, we said goodbye to Casey, who lived a long and good life under @chespo ‚Äôs care. It is hard to fathom a home of four rather than five and harder still what comes after four.

It‚Äôs that time of year again where Mark tries (on my behalf) to get the local Cville Kroger to special order a couple boxes of Papas marshmallow eggs (made in Kentucky), which rarely get distributed outside the Cincinnati metro area. He missed the deadline and had to have his mom procure and ship them this year. 160 delicious thank-yous to Mom.

Visualization of heart rate averages. Reminds me of an Alan Watts lecture when he talks about knowing how to beat your heart or remembering to do so. Do you beat your heart, or don‚Äôt you? Somehow you do it without being able to describe how it is done.

Today my thoughts are with the people I‚Äôve met during 15 years of speaking at the Midwest Writers Workshop (MWW) in Muncie, Indiana. I‚Äôm originally from Indiana, and MWW has been special to me for that reason. But back in 2003 (my first year there), I was uncomfortable telling people in the publishing industry where I was from‚Äîa fact often expressed with light embarrassment. Years of attending MWW was a gradual awakening to the unique good of being from Indiana. It could be a secret super power. The writers I met at MWW reflected the many manifestations of how it is to write in the world, the quiet way some squeeze through cracks unnoticed, and how others blast through walls. You saw how there wasn‚Äôt a single path, only the path you made for yourself. Alan G. showed me that you never get too old to pursue new creative projects; Kelsey demonstrated the power of curiosity combined with boldness; I learned writerly self-acceptance from the words and kindness of Delonda; Jama symbolized the value of fellowship and community. The many writers who returned year after year (forgive me for not naming you one by one) showed me the power of persistence and showing up to do the work. In my mind today, I‚Äôve been sitting next you all, around a table, sharing stories and laughing. ‚ÄúI carry your heart with me.‚Äù ‚Äîee cummings

My gift to myself this year: membership in this bourgeois institution. It‚Äôs like a parallel travel universe to enter into premium airport lounges with mahogany wood paneling, free snacks, fast wifi, and bountiful seating.

(Like a universal basic income, there ought to be a universal basic comfort standard when traveling. When will the human race ever evolve to that point?)

Staying at an AirBnB where the host bakes fresh bread in the morning and brews local coffee. Ready to move in. ‚ù§Ô∏èüè†

Stopped here for lunch in Mooresville, IN - a truly old-school cafeteria, with carved roast beef and dark brown gravy over mashed potatoes, and roast pork slathered in a yellow mustard and brown sugar sauce. Two (or three?) of my sisters worked here when they were young, in the ‚Äò70s, and enjoy telling stories about it. Still in business, still family run.

Back home in Indiana for the holidays, where it‚Äôs always in season to celebrate farm life. üê∑üåΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
