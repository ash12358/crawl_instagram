It’s been quite the birthday celebration the last few days. Last night we headed to the @hollywoodbowl for a surprise concert that threw my #YachtRock loving heart into overdrive. ... The trifecta of Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald, and yes... Christopher Cross ... Today my surprise was a trip to Chicago where no, we’re not seeing the Cubs (and anyone that knows my hubby knows he’s the biggest Cubs fan evah so this is a BIG compromise)... instead we’re here to see Journey and @defleppard ... Little known fact, I lived a little over a year in Chicago and have a huge soft spot for the beauty and history of this city. ... The fun in all of this is how my guy gets me and still, after all these years, works to make every day as special as possible. ... Life is never perfect and goodness knows we weather our storms, but when you love, appreciate and respect one another - the journey only gets better and better. #livinglifeoutloud #ourlifetogether #happinessisthis #travelchicago

I spend a lot of time traveling. The top question I'm asked is, how do you stay connected and productive while on the road? ... My answer is simple: focus on your highest and best. Give away all the rest. ... As an #entrepreneur, you can do anything, but not everything. Stay focused on what’s moving you closer to your goals and stop (for god’s sake) worrying about all the other garbage you can’t control. ... Believe me, you’ll look back one day and wonder why you worried senselessly for so damn long. #dontstopmoving #focusonwhatmatters #motivation💯 #betheone

My latest travels took me through Utah yesterday and into Colorado for the next week. ... It was a perfect morning for a walk here in #Breckenridge with temps that (after just leaving 109° in Las Vegas) makes my heart sing. 💞 ... Here for a conference where I’m speaking, meetings with some of my favorite business minds, and a little family gathering. ... Loving our time on the road and the way we’re allowing it to unfold. Gotta tell you, the control freak in me wants to detail out everything, but then you miss the joy in traveling and enjoying each area, the people, and its unique charm. ... Learning to slow down, live in the moment, and embrace it as it comes. ... Do you struggle with that too? How do you “force” (gently nudge) yourself to slow down? #travelcolorado #travelinglife #entrepreneurtip

To Be Successful, Do What You Do Best... . When you first start your business, you wear a lot of hats. You’re sales, marketing, customer support… “all the things.” . But as you grow your business and learn who you are, and what you bring to the world… it’s critical that you stay focused on what you do best. . Because here’s the really cool thing. No one has the same skills and talents. That’s why we complement each other so well! . Stick with what you know, what YOU do best, and give the rest away! . Because when you do, everything tugging at you, everyone screaming at you, and all those things begging you to go in a direction you don’t want to go or be something you’re not… . They all fade away. . Do YOU. Everything else will fall into place. #justdoit✔️ #beyou💯 #youaretheone

As I look up at this stage I think, “woah... how did I get here?” How do I get the honor to speak on some of the worlds largest stages to the best and brightest minds in marketing? . The answer... passionately, deliberately, and fearlessly following my dream. .

When in Prague, you have to visit Prague Castle, the largest castle in the world. Built in the 9th century, the castle has a fascinating history, including hidden jewels and assignation plots. . The grounds and structures are absolutely stunning. I’ve included a few pics of St. Vitus Cathedral, The Great South Tower and the towering castle as you walk through the gates. . Even had the chance to see the changing of the Guard. Rain was not stopping me today! 😉 #prague❤️ #travelprague #mydayinprague #praguecastle

I’m off to Prague today to speak at @Socialbakers, #EngagePrague. What an honor to kick off this incredible event! ✈️ . And crazy as it seems, I stop in London on the way and barely miss @cameronradice who’s also traveling. But his destination is Cannes where his latest film is screening at the 71st #cannesfilmfestival. 🎉 . Not sure who I’m more excited for... ok, hands down it’s him! Can’t wait to see, “Ghosts” on the bigscreen when it comes to Hollywood.🎬 . OMGoodness so exciting!!

Had lunch with a friend yesterday, you know the kind of friend… where the conversation is effortless. That’s why this lunch was different, strained, even awkward. … As we sat down, I knew she had something on her mind, something she wanted to say. … I asked about her day, her week, her life, her business, and that’s when she started to spill. She was frustrated, felt like she was running, and chasing, and spinning on a hamster wheel. … She asked me, “Is this really what being an entrepreneur is all about?” I told her, no… no it’s not. But I could see the look of shame in her eyes. She’d fallen victim to what so many entrepreneurs do. … And believe me, I totally get it. We’ve all fallen into the trap of believing that the glorification of busy equals success. … We’re busy. Busy building a life, a business, a career. But when you look at it… can you say that the “busy-ness” equals happiness, productivity, and your version of success? … Every day is a battle won if you can focus on the important, push away the urgent, and stay true to  what really matters. Maybe it’s your family, maybe it’s your new client, maybe it’s an exciting  new project you’re working on… whatever your “important” is - go into the day with it right in front of you. … Post it on the wall, write it on your whiteboard, put it on a freaking sticky note if it helps. But don’t let it leave your sight, your mind, or your determination. … So, how will you make the rest of this week matter? What one thing will you do to make your important your everything?

It can be difficult not to look back and wonder “what if,” “should I have” or “did I make the right decision?” ... But looking back only keeps you stuck in a negative spiral. As an entrepreneur, you can embrace the past for the lessons you learned, but you can’t live in it. ... No matter what you’ve faced so far this year, keep pushing, keep believing, keep looking towards the future with optimism, curiosity, and wonder. When you do, magical things unfold!

When you’re feeling stuck or less than creative, change the scenery! ... This park is one of my fave spots to take the dogs and just chill. ... Granted, there’s this view plus the stunning overlook of #downtownla and the green as far as the eye can see LA reservoir down below, but hey... who’s counting the reasons why I love this spot? 😍 ...

“Give yourself a gift of five minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see around you. Go outside and turn your attention to the many miracles around you. This five-minute-a-day regimen of appreciation and gratitude will help you to focus your life in awe.” -Wayne Dyer * I soak up mornings like this. The ocean, some coffee, and quiet time with the hubby and these two boys. Makes my heart happy and my soul settle after a hectic week. * What’s your favorite way to start your Saturday? #ocean🌊 #mydayinla #saturdaymornings #motivationdaily

It’s Friday and I’m feeling a little feisty! After the last week in @vegas, I’m ready to hit the road and beat the heat! This hat was a gift from a dear friend (we had so much fun @malibusafaris the day we bought it) and today it seems the perfect way to roll my way into the weekend. What’s on your agenda? Any big plans? #travelholic #travelusa #liveoutloud #fridayfeels❤️

You know, when the hubby and I first started talking about taking a year to travel, it seemed like an impossible dream. Granted, we both work from home and so in theory could take our business with us and work from anywhere. In reality, the steps it takes to put this kind of plan into action are tremendous. But, over the last 60 days, we took that idea and put it into action. As we pack up our house today and head out for new adventures, I am overwhelmed with emotion. So many amazing memories here, but I know there are so many incredible ones yet to come. And more than that, so much life to live and so many people to see! ❤️ Because what I do know is this... waiting to turn dreams into reality shouldn’t be a back burner, someday kinda project. But too often, putting ourselves first doesn’t happen. But today... we flip that on its head and embark on what we’ve coined our time to “live life out loud.” Can’t imagine where our travels will take us, but do know how excited I am to see all of you as we show up in your city. Cheers to this great adventure! #liveoutloud #traveleverywhere #justdoit #adventureawaits #travelmemories #losangeleslife #lovelosangeles

Yep, it’s podcast day and my excitement level is through the roof!! Today, I have a very special guest on the show and know you’re gonna love it! ... In this episode of the Brand Authority Podcast, I’m chatting with Garrett Moon, CEO and Co-Founder of @CoSchedule. Their story is inspiring and during our time together, he shares it all! ... How Garrett's taken CoSchedule from zilch to 1.5 million monthly page views, 240,000 email subscribers, 9000+ customers, and all in less than 4 years. ... He just published a book called “The 10x Marketing Formula.” As he explains, the premise is that content marketing as we know it is dead. ... Instead, your focus should be on how to short-circuit content marketing by creating competition-free content that garners 10x results. There are new rules, and those that defer to "copycat content" to build their brand get left behind. ... Ready to supercharge your content marketing results?

We’re traveling this week and just received some exciting news. 🔑 We got a clear to close on our new house which means operation #liveoutloud is underway! 🔑 We’ll spend our time between LA and Las Vegas (where our kids live) and the rest of the time will be spent working from anywhere and visiting all of the beautiful locations that make up this country. 🔑 To say I’m excited is an understatement, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say this has been a scary decision as well. 🔑 So much unknown, but all falling perfectly into place. 🔑 Oh and PS... taking you on our travels. We’ll be broadcasting and vlogging from the road as we share our adventure and help others embrace their inner desire to live a BIG, bold life! #lasvegas #lasvegasstrip #traveltogether #travellingram #ourlifeoutloud

Celebrating 20 years with this guy. The one who knew me when I sat in a radio station, talking into a mic every night, working towards a morning gig. ... The guy who knew me when I moved to morning drive and took that show to number one. ... The guy who walked beside me when I took a leap of faith, left morning radio and bought a mortgage company. Then moved from mortgage to real estate and took that company from 1 employee to 100. ... Every step of the way, you were my champion. And all along the way, you held my hand, created our future, and kept me focused, dedicated, and hopelessly in love with you. ... Thank you for being my rock. The one constant in a sea of change. And thank you for going on this new adventure with me. Together, we’re living our life out loud! Happy anniversary baby. #lifeinlove #happinesshappens #doinglifetogether #liveyourdream #lifeoutloud

Reasons why your best friend is your best friend... ... - Because you can share anything with no explanation and they just get you. - Because you both share the same sense of humor. - Because you’re always in sync. - Because anywhere you go, you have a personal photographer. - Because no matter your mood, they help you shake it off, laugh it off, and get on with the day. - Because they brainstorm, collaborate, and ideate with you anytime and anywhere. - Because even though they live across the country from you, it always feels like you live right next door. ... ... I look forward to spending time with @pegfitzpatrick every year at Social Media Marketing World #SMMW18 and love this pic she captured.

Raise your hand if you've ever struggled to manage social media? I don't know about you, but it can be straight up exhausting to keep up with every channel, update, and notification - not to mention all the content it requires. And if you haven't found a flow, put a system in place, or created a strategy... it will get the better of you. ... That's why I tackled this topic in the latest episode of the Brand Authority Podcast. It's real advice on how to manage social media without losing your mind (or feeling like you need a drink!) 🤣 ... If you haven't tuned into the podcast, there's 27 episodes waiting for you! Each one speaks to the biggest struggles faced by anyone trying to build a powerful online brand, but finding it harder than ever to gain traction. ... When I launched the podcast, my goal was to share insight into the systems (cause I love a productive system!), processes, and strategies that’ve helped me build a thriving and successful business and online brand. And your response has been enthusiastic!! ... So as I lay out next steps, tell me: what topics would you love to hear? What are you dying to learn, instill into your business, and what tips can I share that will help you stop spinning your wheels and grow your brand exponentially? ... Oh and next up, I'll be bringing on today's top leaders to share their story as well! Comment below with your topic and who I should interview.

Today is Monday, a new week, and a fresh start. It’s a reminder that how you walk into the day sets the tone for the whole week. ... I choose an attitude of GRATITUDE! Because what’s the alternative? To go into it dragging, kicking, and screaming. Blech, who wants that?!! ... As I enter this incredibly hectic season in my life with a move and all upcoming travel, I am embracing the energy around positive life changes. ... I’m excited, energized, and full of  get-up-and-go! How about you? What’s one thing you can positively work towards this week? ...

I'm in the midst of some awesome, albeit... CRAZY changes in my life. #ad The hubby and I have decided to take a year and travel the country. Our careers allow us to #workfromanywhere and that's exactly what we're going to do. ... Our motto for the year is "Live Out Loud!" ... So with that decision comes a bunch of others. It means selling a home, buying a new one, AND living on the road which translates into a lot of temporary homes we'll want to turn into a home sweet home. And that all equals REDECORATING!!! 😀 ... Just the word redecorate makes my heart sing! But I knew to get a whole new look, I needed to go to my friends at @CORTFurniture. ... They've helped me find that perfect mix of color, clean lines, and modern design. ... They've always been my go-to for a no-hassle solution and this time is no different. I can redesign a room or a whole house when I want and how I want. I love that kind of convenience! ... But now, I need your help! Here's 3 of my fave rooms... all with a very distinct look and feel. Tell me, which one is your favorite? I'd love to know why you'd choose it and how you'd use it in your home! ... And whether you're looking to update your look, create a whole new space, traveling long-distance on temporary assignment, moving off-campus in college or traveling from place to place in the military - CORT has you covered.

There's no shortcut to anyplace worth going! --- If you’re not getting out of your day what you want, take a good hard look at the effort you’re putting into it. It’s easy to “think” you’re accomplishing something when in reality - your tasks are only a distraction from the real work that needs to happen. --- Start by committing to daily rituals, follow the Start, Stop, Continue formula. Answer these questions every day: - what did I start and succeed at (what WIN do I need to celebrate)? - what do I need to stop doing (because it's not working/producing results)? - what 1 thing will I continue to improve upon tomorrow? --- The key is 100% honesty and transparency with yourself and team. You can’t succeed if you’re not committed to going all in and that includes doing the internal work that reflects in your external results. --- Remember, nothing worth having was ever achieved without effort. #dothework #entrepreneurslife #entrepreneurmindset

"Design is the silent ambassador of your brand" -Paul Rand . Frustrated trying to grab the attention of your online audience? If you’re looking for a better way to boost awareness and improve brand recognition, you need to incorporate visual marketing. But you’re here on Instagram, so you probably already know this. 😏 . But do you know what your audience wants, what causes them to take action, and what naturally draws them to you and your brand? . To get to the bottom of this, answer a few questions: 👉 . - What is your greatest strength/weakness? - What unique abilities do you bring to the table? - What differentiates you from your competition? - Are you innovative or traditional in thinking? - How do you prefer to communicate? - What are the needs of my consumer that I can solve? . Note how all of the questions above are open questions. That means you have to do a little bit more thinking than the standard yes or no response. . So let yourself “sit in it,” get a little messy with your brand, and have fun with the process of designing something that not only you love, but your audience potential customers, and Instagram followers ADORE! . I’m excited to speak at #SMMW18 with @smexaminer again this year in the topic of visual marketing. Will you be there? . Smart entrepreneurs know visual marketing is the secret sauce to social media success. Thank you to @suebzimmerman for these gorgeous fans in my brand color - ORANGE!! 🧡🧡🧡 #brandingdesign #brandingcoach #brandingstyle

“A comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing ever grows there.” ~ Author Unknown . This is the year. The year to get out of your comfort zone, stretch yourself, believe that YOU deserve more. .

As an entrepreneur, you know your business and your goals. But do you have a rock solid marketing plan in place that supports and promotes the health of your business? . Sure, there’s a lot of social media experts or pros or gurus or whatever you want to call them telling you what you should or shouldn’t do. . Problem is, I find that almost all of them share one-off strategies. Whether it’s Facebook Ads or networking on LinkedIn, their solution solves one problem, but doesn’t give a realistic or holistic solution that: . 1. Connects all the dots between your business and marketing strategy 2. Gives you a step by step blueprint to making money with social media . Because come on, we’re not here to feel busy, we have to be productive, effective, and profitable, right? . In the latest episode of the, “Brand Authority Podcast,” I share how social media can grow your business, help you sell more products, and make more money. But don’t think I have a magic pill… good things take time! If you want to grow, you have to put a plan in place. .

Focus is a Superpower! If you want to succeed, you have to focus on your ONE Thing. Want to truly maximize your use of social media in 2018? . Answer these 3 questions: - What ONE thing are you trying to achieve with social media? (visibility, awareness, traffic, sales) - What ONE thing do you want to be known for? (stop spreading yourself out and trying “all the things” - niche down and focus on the one thing YOU do best) - What ONE outcome will you provide? (what will your audience be able to achieve by connecting with you? How will they do more, be better, create more success by their affiliation with you and your business?) . If you’re not willing to put in the work, you won’t experience success. And without focus, success will always elude you. . What ONE thing will you focus on today? #keeppushing #neverquit #persistence

The most powerful words you’ll ever say are the ones that follow, “I am.” As we leave 2017 behind, what will your, "I am" statement be? . - I am worthy - I am powerful - I am fully equipped - I am grateful - I am in the exact right place - I am ready for massive growth - I am open to all possibilities - I am not going to settle - I am ready to thrive . There's a few to get you started... now tell me what your mantra will be. I am.... #newyearseve #shinebright #shineeworld #newyears2018

Sitting here and reflecting on the New Year. Thinking through my goals for 2018 and wondering... is it just me or is goal setting hard? Like… one of the hardest things you’ll ever do in your business? . When I started my first business way back in the day (1997), I had no idea where to begin. Should I set lofty goals or realistic ones, and then how should I plan, map, and follow through on those goals? . Trying to wade through those questions was overwhelming, and almost completely stifling. Fortunately for me, I had an amazing coach and mentor that set me straight. . She said to me, “Rebekah… what you focus on expands. If you want to grow a successful business, you have to plan BIG and take massive action.” Great advice and some that I’ve followed my entire career. . And that’s exactly why I decided to put together my entire goal setting process in a brand new guide. . With it, you’ll learn how to achieve anything and everything you want within your business. . It’s the, “2018 Business Goals Guide” and it’s available today! . Not only will your goals give you: - Clarity - Improved performance - Increased motivation to achieve - Self-confidence - Better focus - Stickiness . But you’ll stop guessing at what you want to achieve and how you’re going to get there, and instead put a solid plan of action in place.

Doing some last-minute Christmas shopping and it’s actually a little chilly here in #SoCal. . Nothing compared to my East Coast friends, but it’s definitely putting me in the holiday spirit. 🌴 .

Ever hop on #socialmedia and quickly lose an hour to mindless, clicking, liking, and lurking? STOP! Do this instead: _____ 1. Turn off notifications 2. Schedule 2x per day to respond 3. Intentionally network with 5 people per day 4. Use a timer (15 min for the above) 5. Rinse and repeat _____ Take back your time and day! Get focused on building relationships, encouraging conversation, and expanding your reach through a process you stick with daily. ____ Don’t have your system in place? In my latest episode of the Brand Authority Podcast, I tackle this topic. ____ Listen in and learn the three-step formula you need for social media growth. #linkinbio #takealook 👉

One of my favorite things to do this time of the year is to watch old Christmas cartoons. 🎄 I remember as a kid how exciting it was to stay up late and watch Rudolph guide that sleigh or Frosty shout, “Happy Birthday!” ❄️ That’s probably why I loved this “advice from a Snowman” so much when I stumbled upon it today. Words of wisdom that we can all live by! 🎄 - Be a jolly, happy soul. - Spend time outdoors. - Stay cool. - It's OK to be a little bottom-heavy. 😂 - Avoid meltdowns. - Be well-rounded. - Live well, life is short! ❄️ What’s your favorite holiday movie? #christmas2017 #snowman⛄️ #christmasmood #holidayspirit

As I speak, travel, and meet new people, the number one thing I’m always asked is, “what’s the first question I need to answer before I market my business online?” My response? ___ What problem are you really solving and who are you solving it for? Ok… so that’s actually two questions, but they’re wrapped up into one big answer. And I say big because of its potential effect on how you show up, how people respond, and whether or not they take action. Here’s what I mean… ___ When you speak to everyone, you talk with no one. And when you try to solve everyone’s problem, you end up with a vague, unclear result. If you want to create a crystal clear message, ___ Your target market should be laser focused. Oh sure, I know plenty will tell you to go broad, cast a wider net, catch as many “fish” as you possibly can. I call BS on that. If you want to connect with the right people, you need to speak their language. And the only way to do that is to get intimately involved in solving their problem. ___ Because once you know what problem you’re actually solving and the outcome you provide, it’s easy to place your audience in that narrative, draw them to your company, and show them the transformation that happens when they take that next step with you. ___ And wouldn’t you rather naturally attract those people than spend more money and waste more time trying to find and connect with them? ___ Get to know their NEEDS and you’re already on your way to bigger, better, and brighter 2018. ___ - Natural motivators. - Energy - Enthusiasm - Desire - Story ___ Having this knowledge, allows you to tailor your content to your audience and share content that speaks directly to their needs and desires. ___ Provide your audience with what they want in a way that most appeals to them and you’ll win them over. Now it’s your turn, “what problem are you solving and who are you solving it for?” #entrepreneur #liveyourdream

"Dream BIG, Play hard, smile often, never give up!" ___ Last week I did something in my business for the first time ever. And it scared the crap out of me. Not because I don’t love a challenge, because believe me… taking on anything ambitious is my favorite place to live. ___ But even still, I don’t care who you are, anytime you go all in, leaving yourself completely vulnerable, totally transparent, and completely exposed… it’s a little nerve-wracking. ___ And no, just for the record, I didn’t go streaking… 😉 I created something in partnership with one of the most incredible female entrepreneurs I know, @debra11 and with the help, love, and support of the best team on the planet. And all of it was born out of a deep desire to serve on a whole new level. ___ On Thursday, we launched our all-new Masterclass with one big goal: run a live test on content that would translate into a pillar coaching product. Now while, I could be “that marketer,” pumping out a whole lot of one-off metrics and a bunch of false statements, I will tell you this: everything we set out to do was accomplished. - Launch a new signature group coaching product? CHECK! - Create a program that allows any entrepreneur (up and coming or currently in the position) to accelerate their growth? CHECK! - Take years of learning and translate it into a 360° training program that allows growth driven leaders to create: - Transformative - Catalytic - Collaborative - Demonstrative, and business-altering results. CHECK! - Attract a tribe that’s eager to change the trajectory of their 2018? CHECK! - Oh, and finally… Achieve projected revenue key target? CHECK! ___ So, here’s what I know after all of these years. If you have a dream, if you know deep down inside that you have something unique to bring to the world… don't let the fear of what you don't know, keep you 100% out of the game. ___ If you've felt compelled to stay where you are because you need to "learn more, be more, do more" before you take action, DON'T do it. Because the truth is... people need what you have to offer. Believe it, and OWN it. People need YOU! #believe #entrepreneur #gogetit

Not sure what it is about snow, but it always makes me feel like a kid. Snowmen, snow angels, snow forts, snowball fights... all great reminders that a little unadulterated joy is good for the mind, body, and soul! —— Is snow in your forecast?

“Until you spread your wings, you will have no idea how far you can fly!” —- At age 11, I stepped out onto the stage and belted out, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” to my graduating class of 6th graders. To say I was nervous would be an understatement. I’d practiced for months, but now as I sat at the piano, my stomach was doing flip flops. —— As I began my countdown… One… Two… Three… Four (take a deep breath) and Go.... my fingers started to fly and words began to fall out of my mouth. ——- Oh my gosh... I was singing! It was actually happening! ——- That moment and that day helped me follow a dream. I went on to to tour across country for all of my junior and high school years. Performing as a small ensemble group, we performed in competition after competition. —— But even after 100’s of performances, those butterflies never went away. It was the culmination of excitement, nerves, and a fierce desire to win. —— That same drive propels me today. It also reminds me that no matter what I’m looking to tackle, nothing can stop me. But imagine if I’d held back, said I wasn’t good enough or not ready? Imagine if I’d never had my moment on that stage? —— We all have a gift to bring to the world. Whether you feel ready to present it or not is inconsequential. Because the truth is, you are fully equipped - right here, right now - no matter the situation, to step onto your own stage. You might just need a little nudge. :) —— And that’s where my two-day Masterclass with Top International Coach,  @debra11 - “The Power of You: How to Radically Change Your Life and Business” comes in. —— Together, we’ll show you how to Design, Plan, and Grow a business and life that propels you out of bed every day with energy and enthusiasm. —— Want to learn more?

**KNOW YOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS!** One of the most overlooked decisions is which social networks you’ll spend time on. Instead of focusing on where your audience is hanging out, you bounce all over the place. ___ One day you’re into Facebook, then Instagram, maybe a little YouTube, and before you know it… you’re exhausted trying to keep up. ___ Here’s what you should do instead of trying to keep up with every social network … (HINT: it's not about doing more!) ___ Answer these questions: - What’s your business focus? (industry, niche, vertical) - Who is your target market? (geographic area, age, income, race, gender) - What’s their social media engagement and conversational style? Find the right place for your message and be there - CONSISTENTLY!!!

Doing what you love and loving what you do...the best reward for following your passion, never saying no to your dreams, and ALWAYS giving more than anyone ever expects. --- If you want it - whether it's speaking more, writing a book, growing your coaching business - YOU can do it. The difference between making it happen and letting the moment pass is one thing... taking massive action. --- #justdoit #makeithappen #stopdreaming #successmindset

“Nothing worth having was ever achieved without effort.” — If you’re not getting out of your day what you want, take a good hard look at the effort you’re putting into it. It’s easy to “think” you’re accomplishing something, when in reality - your tasks are only a distraction from the real work that needs to happen. — Start by committing to daily rituals - follow the Start, Stop, Continue formula. Answer these questions every day: - what did I succeed at? - what needs improvement? - what 1 thing will I improve upon tomorrow? — The key is 100% honesty and transparency with yourself and team. You can’t win if you’re not committed to going all in —  and that includes doing the internal work that reflects in your external results. It’s a new week. Make it SHINE! #goals❤️ #gogetit #makeitcount #mondaymood

Some days, as I rush out the door to a meeting, presentation, or new company training, I have to remind myself to slow down. We can get so caught up in all the "stuff" that needs to get done that we forget to focus on what matters most -- the things happening right here and right now. --- If you want to perform at your highest level and get more done, there's one simple way to do it -- be present! Listen more, ask better questions, truly take an interest in what's happening around you. --- It might sound like a trivial idea, but I promise you that the gift of your "presence and focus" will mean everything to those you're with. #bepresent

"No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted." - Aesop --- It's amazing the power of kindness. I'm constantly reminded in my day to day and online conversations that there's no word, act, or kindness shown that doesn't have the power to change someone's moment, day, or life. --- Be brave in giving away your kind words. Let those around you feel your support, see your generosity, and connect with your compassion. It really does make all the difference! #kindness #kindnessmatters #bekind #embrace #happy

"Content repurposing isn’t a new idea, but it certainly is an underutilized one. When you repurpose, you take one piece of content and turn it into many. And the beauty behind this tactic? You get more mileage out of your content, a higher impact, and all at a lower cost. In other words – more bang for your marketing dollar." . "And there’s so many ways to repurpose your top content. You can turn it into a Slideshare of 3-5 tips, a Youtube video, infographic, podcast, webinar – the sky’s the limit. Tap into your creativity and test what works, drive traffic, and increase your social media engagement." --- Thank you @meetanahoffman for this post! #repost --- Do YOU want more bang for your marketing dollar? 😉 👇 👇 👇 text the word RECONTENT to 444999 to get the free PDF of Ana's entire recontent process. ⠀⠀ ☕️ ...or copy the link below to read more.

"If you fear failure, you will never go anywhere." I don't know an entrepreneur or business owner who hasn't felt fear. Fear of the unknown, of trying something new, taking on a new role or responsiblity.... --- Whatever that fear is, the key to overcoming it is to reframe it. Instead of something scary, flip it around. How will overcoming that supposed obstacle actually work to your advantage? What good - no GREAT - things will happen when you step into it? --- Let go of what only lives in your head, and face that fear - it will become the fuel that drives your success.

“The best brands are built on great stories.” I love this quote from Ian Rowden because it’s so true. ___ Stories bind and connect. They create points of interest and encourage deeper, more significant relationships. A great story is the reason we choose one brand over another. How are you using social media to tell your company story? ___ Not sure where to begin? Here’s a few questions you can answer: - What are the top 3 problems you solve? - What 2-3 details about your company make it unique? - What are the top 3 words anyone would use to describe your company? ___ Now go write your unique story! #storytelling #brandstory #authority #branding

As business professionals, we tend to focus on fixing our weaknesses. - impatient, procrastinate, short-sighted, terrible at delegating tasks. We see those as our achilles heel and a hindrance to further growth. But, today - I want you to flip that thinking on it’s head and focus on your strengths instead! ___ Here’s a few questions you can answer to find your strengths - those things you do better than anyone else. - What do you love to do every day and why does it light you up? - What challenge have you overcome that you’re most proud of - What’s your biggest achievement and why does it matter to you? ___ Focus on your strengths to make massive shifts in your productivity. Plus, the bonus? You’ll give your social profiles a BIG boost of positive energy when you start talking about your strengths (what you have), and not your weaknesses. (what you don’t have).

Social media isn’t as simple as it seems. Oh sure. From the surface, it looks like play time. Post to Facebook, add a pretty picture to Instagram, tweet a blog post.

Do you really know your target audience? Because if you don't and you're speaking to everyone, you're reaching no one. --- As a blogger, becoming an authority in your field results in increased recognition, credibility, and business opportunities. You set that tone through your content. The more you write, create, and share, the higher your trust factor rises. But you can only do this if you know your market! --- Once readers trust your expertise enough to revisit, they’ll begin to share your content and even link to it, and that’s your ultimate goal. --- To begin this process, you need a content strategy. In my new post up today on @DigitalCurrent, I share the exact steps it takes to build a content marketing machine that positions you as the go-to leader in your industry or niche.

It's Monday...are you running the day or is the day running you? If you want to succeed at social media and build a better strategy, you need to get more done in less time. And own your day! --- This means you need to: 1. Stop working on tasks that don’t deserve your attention. 2. Stop giving too much time to tasks that can and should be done faster. --- There’s no secret formula that will make you productive on social media overnight. But you can take immediate steps to improve your habits. Here's how you can do this: - Focus on one social media task at a time. Complete it with no distractions before you move on to the next. - When you start to multi task, you force yourself to stop. Think of the wasted time it takes to get back on track? --- Take the challenge and stick with it for one week. See how it makes you feel… - Less stress? - Reduced overwhelm? - More productive? - Getting things done that matter? --- Stop running and instead, get results through increased productivity. I guarantee it will inspire new energy and drive. 🎉 #mondaymotivation #productivity

Today is the first day of February -- the month of love! ❤️ It's a great time to remember how truly special your audience, customers, fans, and followers are! --- How can you show and tell them all year long? - Create Meaningful Conversations: move away from the transactional mindset, and instead work to create meaningful, intelligent and worthwhile relationships that go beyond a double tap, LIKE, share or comment. - Communicate Value: show your audience how much you care by GIVING, giving, and giving some more. If you offer information аnd vаluе bеуоnd whаt іѕ сurrеntlу аvаіlаblе, уоu'll bе embraced, appreciated, аnd financially rewarded. - Embrace Your Community: building relationships is about nurturing and improving upon them.

Everyone loves to know they're appreciated. Taking a moment to say thank you goes a long way. Wouldn't you agree? --- Thank you to each and every one of you that support me every day.
