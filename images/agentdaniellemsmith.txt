After a weekend and a few days of being beyond sick, having time with my thoughts and sometimes not always the best ones this really resonated with me. Had to share. 🙌🏼 . . . #Repost @theangrytherapist ・・・ Instead of sucking energy and getting caught in vicious negative thought patterns that dilute your being, strip your soul, and smash your dreams, you begin to generate energy that punctures space and grabs stars.

So it’s official, I’m in LOVE with @hilarysgraves place. It’s stunning, every square inch. So peaceful and somewhere I could get lost for hours just wandering through the green earth. Love it. Thank you so so much for having Eden and I over tonight Hilary! She still hasn’t stopped talking about it and Sally the pig! 🐖💚

She was so little. And yet, still today just as beautiful. Love this girl of mine. More than words. ❤️ . . Today someone I value greatly told me I’m a good mother. Someone I know and trust very well. They told me that one day my children will look back with gratitude for all I’ve taught them, for the love I’ve given them, for my time and even, for the discipline. That they will tell me how much they love and respect me. It’s funny how hearing those words from someone else, someone not related to me and yet someone valued and trusted meant so much. There’s a chance it will be decades before I hear anything (if ever) from my children like this, but just hearing these words today helped more than I can say. . . Sometimes we all need to hear these things and sometimes it comes from people like those of you reading this post. So maybe today in your interactions with others look to see how you can lift someone up. How can you show them their greatness? How can you help shine a small bit of light into their world in just a few words? I promise it won’t take long and it may make a world of difference. #littlethingsinlife #love #gratitude #motherhood #parenting #life

Taken shortly after she said, “Yes! I got a gold scope assault rifle! Sweet!” The fact that she even knows what one is kills me. Haha! But I sort of love this photo of her. Eden is so diverse in her choice of activities; from swimming (her current favorite) to sewing to baking to gardening to so many other things. Gaming is now one of those things and it’s fun to see her having fun, kicking butt and taking names! Ha! #gamergirl #summertime #fortnite #whilemomworks

Just setting @maryweberauthor’s post here.💚 ・・・ CAN I SCREAM NOW?? BECAUSE HERE IS THE COVER!!!! 😭😱😍 . You guys, I am flailing. I’ve been flailing for weeks since they sent it. I AM A FLAIL-ER. Because WHAT IS THIS MAGIC? . I LOVE cover reveals, and the reality that I get to help with my own chokes me every time. That I get to write at all & that you read it is the most humbling honor ever. THANK YOU for your kindness, dear friends & readers. 💛 You know you have my heart. . If you swipe the pics, you’ll see that 1. WE TOOK OVER THE IG #coverreveal HASHTAG YESTERDAY🙈😘 2. You can now ADD To Best The Boys on #GOODREADS 3. You can PREORDER IT anywhere books are sold 4. Link’s are in my BIO!! 😘🙈😘🙈😘🙈😘 . Release date is March 5 . And here’s the SUMMARY: In a new fantasy novel from Mary Weber, bestselling author of the Storm Siren series and the Sofi Snow books, one girl makes a stand against society and enters a world made exclusively for men. . Every year for the past fifty-four years, the residents of Pinsbury Port receive a mysterious letter inviting all eligible-aged boys to compete for an esteemed scholarship to the all-male Stemwick University. Every year, the poorer residents look to see that their names are on the list. The wealthier look to see how likely their sons are to survive. And Rhen Tellur opens it to see if she can derive which substances the ink and parchment are created from, using her father’s microscope. . In the province of Caldon, where women are trained in wifely duties and men are encouraged into collegiate education, sixteen-year-old Rhen Tellur wants nothing more than to become a scientist. As the poor of her seaside town fall prey to a deadly disease, she and her father work desperately to find a cure. But when her Mum succumbs to it as well? Rhen decides to take the future into her own hands—through the annual all-male scholarship competition. . With her cousin, Seleni, by her side, the girls don disguises and enter Mr. Holm’s labyrinth, to best the boys and claim the scholarship prize. Except not everyone’s ready for a girl who doesn’t know her place. And not everyone survives the maze. . ALL MY LOVE TO YOU PRECIOUSES. 😘

Taking a page out of @billgrundler’s insta and keeping things real for a moment. Really real...I mean look at the bags under my eyes. Yikes!! ... Last week I ran into a friend during some errands in town. She’s someone I’ve only been able to keep in touch with via FB and insta because of the move from SLO to AG. She was so kind to say how inspiring my posts always are, how encouraging and uplifting everything I’m always doing are. I walked away from the conversation feeling like a complete fake. Because despite trying to “keep things real” here and elsewhere on social media, they still have their shiny veneer that make things look sparkly and effortless. That’s not to say that I want to be negative, but things simply aren’t as easy as Instagram may make them seem. They also aren’t that hard either. There are good days...and bad ones. ... This last week has been so LONG. It was the first week of summer break. And as much as I love my kids I also love my work, which happens to be really taking off and extremely busy. The first two weeks of summer break tend to be a lot like the first two weeks of school though I find and it requires a lot of patience on my part, adjusting and realigning of schedules. I am exhausted. I’ve been staying up until 2am or later most nights working to compensate for days with kids at the pool taking them to lessons, baking, coloring and all things summer. We’re having fun and I love being with them, but the juggling...oh the juggling. Thankfully I’m getting older, experienced and better at knowing my limits, how to delegate tasks and what can be done. It’s a process and one I’m hoping the people I work with will be patient with me over. Here’s to just a few more days while I grind through and get to an even keel where I get back in my groove again. 😊💪🏼 #workathomemom #summer #summerbreak #agentlife

Truth 🙌🏼 #trusttheprocess . . . #Repost @spiritdaughter ・・・ There’s a plan- trust it ✨ ⠀ As we revisit our last month’s intentions before the New Moon tomorrow, we may spot some that seem stuck or not willing to evolve. Things may appear to not be working out when in fact they are, we’re just not aware of how at this time. Some of the most grateful moments of our lives are when we realize the path we were lead down after something didn’t work out. Think of these times as a redirection, and trust that in the end, it’s always working out. ⠀ #waningmoon #prenewmoon #quote #inspoquote

Reposting @vanessasbennett’s beautiful post and adding a few of my own thoughts... To say the last few months have been hard around here is likely an understatement. In some ways  the suicides of Anthony Bourdain, Kate Spade, Chester Bennington, Chris Cornell...my cousin Kaila, and so many others recently seems to echo the feeling in the world and sadly sometimes within the walls of our home. Each day I wake to hear that the world has lost yet another bright and beautiful creative piece of our collective while my heart breaks just a little more. At the same time though, a part of me says, “carry on, burn more brightly, carry the torch and don’t forget those that have gone...honor and remember them in your doing.” So, in my weaknesses I will do my very best to push forward and make dark things light. I will help where I can and seek to always remember the joy that is found in the doing and shining brightly for others. ❤️ ・・・ #Repost @vanessasbennett ・・・ “For a moment, or a second, the pinched expressions of the cynical, world-weary, throat-cutting, miserable bastards we’ve all had to become disappears, when we’re confronted with something as simple as a plate of food.” -Anthony Bourdain ✨ Thanks for making us seek out the people, the culture, and the story as much as we seek out the food @anthonybourdain ✨ 50 people commit suicide every day. Check on your friends. Ask them how they are. Ask them the hard questions and be strong, “I think you might hurt yourself, I think it’s time we get help.” Don’t just reach out through FB or DM. Call. Stop by. Human contact and genuine care is sometimes the most important medicine, and something some people get far too little of. ✨ It’s also important to remember that sometimes people who seem fine have actually been struggling in silence for a long time. There is nothing shameful about asking for help, but our society in particular makes it very much seem that way. 1-800-273-TALK

So extremely excited for today’s publication of WALK YOUR DOG by Elizabeth Stevens Omlor (@estevens03) and illustrated by Neesha Hudson (@neeshas_art)! When we first sent this book out into the world I remember how in love with it I was, but it’s evolution over the editing process has me even more head over heels in love with this adorable little girl and her sweet pup! Both Elizabeth and Neesha have worked so hard on this book and their careers and I’m so proud to work with them both. This book will no doubt be the first of many to fill your shelves with their names on it, but the first is always so special. Not to mention, does it get much better than a re-readable story with an adorable dog? Seriously, kids are going to pour over this again and again! I can’t wait!! Congratulations ladies on of your hard work!

‪Just back from a fun trip to LA and San Diego, and now come back to even more fun...the publication of this fantastic new book by @julie_falatko! I’m over the moon thrilled for her and beyond proud of her. She’s worked so hard, not just on the writing but also behind the scenes to make the book a success. Julie’s dedication not only to her craft, but also to her career is not only admirable but inspiring and constantly pushes me to hustle harder. I’m so proud...so so proud! Also, this book is freaking hilarious, as both my daughter and son will attest to as well! TWO DOGS IN A TRENCHCOAT GO TO SCHOOL is the first in a series of hilarious antics and brilliant storytelling out from @scholasticinc today!!! Congratulations Julie!!! 💙💙💙 . #mglit #childrensbooks #middlegradebooks #kidlit #twodogs #dogsofinstagram #twodogsinatrenchcoat #childrenslibrarian #kidsreading #kidsbooks #kidsbookstagram ‬

Truth. 🙌🏼 I’m certainly not exempt from this in any area of my life either. I’ve seen it when I learned to play the flute years ago to writing in the past few years to Crossfit in the last year and a half. Love this. . #Repost @crossfittraining ・・・ 👌 - @crossfit #CrossFit #CrossFitTraining

So, we did this thing today at #Crossfit...LINDA. Boy howdy was it a doozy! Honestly, I went into it thinking it would be a lot of fun because it was primarily movements I enjoy like deadlifts & bench press. Well, I’m leaving out the squat cleans because those are what killed me, but still...it was a lot of fun! . Our box put the workout on in celebration & as a way to support our own athlete going to the West Regionals next week in Del Mar CA, Dane Mclaughlin @returnofdmac25. So all around it was just a fun morning. There was a great turn out & so much support for an incredible person, athlete, Inferno coach and all around great example to all of us. Dane generally quietly goes about doing his thing in the back room, constantly crushing workout after workout but also manages to crush school and life. I know I speak for so many folks at the gym that will be cheering him on this weekend when I say that we will be sending all our support & energy his way! . For me this workout was fun also because one of my first coaches came in for the “event” for Dane, Robby Lorber. He was the coach I had when I got my first deadlift PR & challenged me to get it up to 200# & I did! Today as I repped out deadlift after deadlift at #205 I couldn’t help but laugh a little inside & think about how much I’ve changed. How far I’ve come. My other weights were both 85# for the bench & squat clean. I could have done a bit higher on both, but it would have wiped me out & I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere close to as far as I did. The rep scheme goes 10-9-8-7-6... of each movement all the way down to 1. I finished the 6th, so 120 reps with still 45 more reps to go. It seems deceptively simple, as do most workouts in Crossfit, but dang was it fun. I will admit that the squat tabata I did the day previous wasn’t especially helpful with the squat cleans but I just kept telling myself the pain wasn’t really there & eventually it just went away. Gotta love it! Can’t wait for next weekend & #crossfitregionals! It’s gonna be a blast!! Especially so because we get to watch Dane kill it! 📷❤️: @jeanette_janet ❤️ #crossfit #crossfitgirls #girlswholift #powerlifting #crossfitlinda

Tagging @djluckylou and saying thanks for sharing this because it’s so true. One of the reasons I love the work I do is because I take so much joy out of seeing authors and illustrators succeeding. It means a lot to me to be a part of that process. Not only within my work, but I love seeing people reach their goals and then soar high above them. It’s what we were all born to do. #dream #dreamhard #dreamhardworkharder #achieve #hardwork #motivation #crossfit

There aren’t many photos of me working out. Most are from competitions or, like this one, are taken during a workout by my coach @billgrundler to be used for our daily blog post @crossfitinferno. It’s actually something I’m hoping to change, not because enjoy pictures of myself working out but because it shows me there’s progress. Days when meeting my macros and getting into the box are tough, these pictures remind me of how far I’ve come and how much I’m able to push myself. In this workout we had to do  3 rounds of 21-21-42 deadlifts-ringdips-weighted air squats. My deadlift weight was heavy at #175 and my weighted squat plate was #35. I’m still working on ring-dips unassisted, but they felt good even with a band helping out. Doing this kind of workout even a year ago would have destroyed me, this still did but in all the best ways. There are days when I wonder how I stay motivated and push through when it feels like I’m the only one pushing. What does it matter? Who else really cares? Honestly? It doesn’t matter, especially if no one else cares. But it matters to me, to who I am and to who I want to be and who I’m becoming. We all have rough days, sometimes a few rough days, but remembering the ‘why’ behind what we do makes all the difference. I do #Crossfit because for the first time in a long time I feel strong, I feel in control and powerful. Its fun! It’s the one place I can go and for an hour I lose myself in a few tasks that I would have never thought possible and I overcome. It’s tough, but I’m tougher and no one can come between me and that. No one. And I love it. . . #crossfit #crossfitgirls #crossfitcommunity #crossfitinferno #girlswholift

This has long been one of my absolute favorite pictures of my mom, but she may shoot me for posting it. Ha! (Sorry @robynski) My mom and I have had our ups and downs through the years, but one thing I’ve always known is that when things are tough that she and my dad will be there in a moments notice. The last couple of months they’ve visited, called, texted and helped when we needed them the most. As I get older I am able to look back and get to know myself & my mom better and can see that so much of the strength that I have within me comes from her and her example. Happy Mother’s Day Mom! As Eden always says, I love you to the moon and back! ❤️❤️

May the 4th Be with You! Running a bit behind today due to costuming around these parts and so we had to opt for photos sans the car. Rey hair for Eden and Kylo Ren for Jace who was full-blown method acting in his costume and refusing to have his photo taken. Ha!

#tbt to a few weeks ago when, in the midst of a bit of chaos here at home, I took some time to work on something I’m really passionate about, #crossfitkids. The incredible opportunity came about in part because @crossfittraining brought the @crossfitkids seminar to my home gym @crossfitinferno, it was something I simply couldn’t pass up. @jdg_training, Rusty and @breannemdavis were phenomenal teachers and I learned so much not only about coaching kids, but truly about movement, coaching as well as about pushing me out of my comfort zone and into a space where I’m able to grow as an athlete and individual. It was amazing and I honestly hope they bring more seminars to @crossfitinferno in the future. I’m stoked to have my #CrossFitKids certification and work toward my other goals within fitness while continuing on my path as an agent, mom, wife and all around determined individual. #livelifetothefullest #crossfitgirls #crossfitinferno @crossfittraining @crossfit @thedavecastro @billgrundler

What? You don’t make cakes from scratch on a whim because everyone is home sick? Bah! Well, I’m not sick, but both the kids are...again. So why not bake a @kingarthurflour vanilla cake with my mom’s (@robynski) amazing buttercream recipe. We were planning on making @bravetart’s homemade sprinkles as well, but realized they need a couple of days to prep. So we’ll be making those this weekend most likely. I swear between @apsmith227 and @edensidneysmith it’s a miracle I ever hit my macros...right, @kassiheidemann?! Somehow I’m still doing pretty well though! At the 10# down marker as of this morning! #woot!! #cake #macros #crossfit #livinglife

Today Eden did her thing. She LOVES recreating covers of books she loves, especially when she knows I work with the authors or illustrators behind them. This one I am fortunate to work with Jennifer Bower who did the amazing artwork for the story Audrey Vernick crafted about the true life story of Max Patkin: THE FUNNIEST MAN IN BASEBALL. When Eden finished she had redone the cover at least four different times that I know of and she went back through the rest of the book and said, “wow! How did Jenn make all this art for the entire book? It’s amazing!” She also commented that she had no idea who Max Patkin was before the book and now she knows “everything” about him! Ha! I love it! And I love how books unlock not only knowledge about things we may have never known or learned about but creativity and in this case it pushed her to keep trying. She tried multiple different types of paints, watercolor, sharpies, and pencils all to get the right look. Love this. And makes my job that much cooler. #justsaying #agentlife @brickwallbowersmom @audrey_vernick #books #kidsbooks #kidsbookstagram

This picture doesn’t do this mug justice. So pretty!!! Just a little celebration drink with the always phenomenal @asab204. Celebrating first and foremost losing 8.5lbs during my first two weeks of my first major cut with my fabulous nutritionist @kassiheidemann!!! (And technically there are still three days to go!) Also, generally celebrating getting through the last few weeks with most of my hair and sanity. Thankful for family, good friends, wonderful clients, #crossfit, coaches who listen at all hours of the day and night, and life for being what it is. Grateful today also for the sun, to be alive and strong. 💛☀️💪🏼 #macros

Late in the day, but Happy Siblings Day to two of the most important people in my life @bri_dummar & @cheekybulldog. I couldn’t get through life without these two and I’m so grateful to have them both in my life. We’ve been through everything together and I know that when life gets rough or when we have celebrating to do they are the first to step up. Love you both Bri and Gill!! ❤️❤️❤️ #tothemoonandback #love #siblingsday

My two rocks. We don’t talk about life behind our four walls, do we? Not really. Maybe I’m more open than most, but even so I don’t share everything with everyone. It’s been hard around here the last couple of weeks. Not hard, I have the flu and I need some cold meds hard, but hard I need my mom and something the best comfort food can’t really even touch. Hard because it’s not me that’s going through it and I have to watch and hope. Hope that by some miracle we all make it through this. Through it all though, these two beaming little kiddos get me through it. Yeah sure they have their not-so-fun moments, but they also have times when their hugs fix everything to my very core like sunshine stitching my soul back together in places I didn’t know was broken. I’m so grateful for them both. For their spirits. For the way they are and for who they are to me. So grateful. ❤️

When you have not one, but two client books come out in one day it’s cause to celebrate! I’m so proud of both of these books, and their authors @carolyncrimi1228 and @maryweberauthor. Each one continually creates incredible words and shares their talent with readers where ever they go. It’s an honor to represent them both and I couldn’t be more thrilled for these and the future books they have to come. Congratulations ladies!!!

Truly, I feel so fortunate to work with the authors I do and @maryweberauthor is no exception. This campaign she’s running to help end human trafficking a so important and close to my heart. Please go to her page on Instagram and click the link for details. 💙 . Repost from @maryweberauthor using @RepostRegramApp - . As many of you know, the issue of human trafficking is a passion for Peter & I. Our eldest is working overseas with victims this year, & while not at all graphic (it’s aliens & adventure, hello), I wrote THE EVAPORATION OF SOFI SNOW & RECLAIMING SHILO SNOW to open up the compassion conversation & share my heart on who I believe we can be as a human community. . So here’s the deal💙 . In the past Peter & I have donated royalties from STORM SIREN, made private donations, etc, to A21 & others. However, this time we really wanted to utilize the tools we have, to raise as broad an awareness as possible. We also very much want to honor you, our dear readers (we love you!), & give back in YOUR names. . With that in mind, Peter & I are personally running an A21 campaign for the next 2 weeks - & have committed to a number of items. . (1) We’re donating a dollar in the name of each person who's ordered RECLAIMING SHILO SNOW (anytime in the past up until its release in 2 weeks on March 6th)*. If you order it - you can send your name & screenshot of the receipt to the email Mary@MchristineWeber.com, & we'll make a donation in your name to A21. This is our gift to you. . (2) If you'd rather forego the book but still want to donate to A21 - we'd love to send you something! Just email a screenshot of your donation receipt, full name, & mailing address to the above listed email, & we'll get some swag out to you. . (3) If you simply want to make a donation to A21 without the extras, please do! And thank you so much. . Truly, thank you. For believing that we can all make a difference. . You can find full details on my A21 Page - the link is in my bio. 💙

One of my mom’s (@robynski) friends shared this early and it felt extremely fitting. Except, that I still in fact do go to the gym almost daily. Which might explain why I almost always look like a human punching bag with bruises from head-to-toe. #naturalbornklutz 😂 Repost from @marcijjohnson using @RepostRegramApp - #truth #letterboard #totallycopied

Some days I just really feel like giving up. Like throwing in the towel. It feels like just about anything would be better and easier than putting one foot in front of the other anymore. Not even that, but it would feel free to let go, to not care so much. To not be concerned about every small action and weight I carry and do. About how I sometimes drop balls because I carry so much and by doing so I let down people I really love and care about. Today it piled on. Today was one of those days. But then I had this guy to hang out with. His goofy, silly, funny awesome way of being always has a way of brightening my day. He just wanted one thing, frozen yogurt. It was something I could do. So we did. And he laughed and made goofy faces all the way through our time together. #love

YES!!! I’m so excited to say that I got not one toes to bar, but multiple and was even able to finish an entire round of the workout. Coming into it with the goal of just getting one toes to bar for the first time and now being able to say that I’ve been able to get the eight I needed for the first round and then some, is more than I could have hoped for. Thank you so so so much, @billgrundler. Somehow Bill always knows just what to say, how to coach and when so that I can get just what I need out of myself and more importantly-get out of my own head! Ha! He goes above and beyond. As does my other coach, @kassiheidemann, whom I couldn’t have done this without either. Her help these last few weeks with everything in the gym and out has meant so much. Not to mention how good many new pairs of workout pants I need to buy thanks to her nutrition help! Thank you both so so much! What I really learned today is that yes, as Bill says I need to let all the crap go and just get done what needs to be done, but also that I need support. I need to be believed in. That I can’t really go it alone. Having @apsmith227 by my side through it as I tried over and over and over again was so important. Everyone at @crossfitinferno from @mrs_dparsons to @hilarysgraves to @louiecampo to Kim to @amanda_nichole_duckett to @jeanette_janet to @twiederhold to so many others, everyone helped. Just feeling their energy, support and belief in me meant more than I can say. Thank you guys!! I did it!!! 💪🏼🎉❤️ #crossfit #crossfitopen

Seems pretty fitting for my day today...what do you think @billgrundler? Not only am I a horrible perfectionist I also hate to let other people down and what I didn’t say today was that I’m horribly afraid of letting down not only Bill Grundler with this 18.1 workout, but more than anyone...myself. It seems horribly ridiculous, but I’m SO hard on myself about everything. Because why not? Life isn’t hard enough as it is already why not make it harder by being hard on ourselves? It reads ridiculously even, doesn’t it? So, tomorrow I’m going to walk into the gym, listen to the timer click off and I’m going to get my damn toes to the bar...or I won’t. But dammit I’m going to try and know it’s okay if I don’t get it because I will eventually. Even if I have to do it all by myself. Because I matter. Because I like this CrossFit thing. #believe #crossfit #crossfitopen #crossfitinferno #fun #perfectionist

Today has me thinking about love. About what I have and what I’m grateful for. We’ve had this sign in our home since the first year we were married thanks to our good friend @bjorktastic and it’s a constant reminder to me that the most valuable and important thing in life is something you can’t hold or possess. It’s something that can’t be taken, but must be given freely. It’s something that can mean life itself, but can cause so much joy and pain. Love. And more than anyone in my life, I’m grateful for these three people who daily bring love in their own way into my heart and hopefully I do the same for them. I’m also so very grateful for friends and extended family not pictured here who do the same. Love is and can be such a powerful force for good. For myself, I’m so beyond grateful for all the love I have in my life and for the opportunities I have to share it with others. Happy Valentines Day one and all!!! 💖💖💖 #greatestthing #love #valentinesday #valentines

Today this sweet girl is nine!! 9! Wow! How did that happen? Time flies and she grows up so quickly! Eden is such a wonderful part of our family. She is by far the most out-going extroverted member of our family, despite her shy demeanor in public. She’s always wanting to go and see and do. Always the adventurer; something she’s carried with her since she could get around on her own. And her heart, does this girl have a heart or what? Bigger than can be contained some times, she cares deeply and so much for friends family and of course animals. I have no doubt she’ll go on to do great things whether they be with sports, animals, education, anything, the sky is the limit. So proud and so fortunate to have her in our family, and as my daughter. Love you Eden, to the moon and back. XOXO 💖

Borrowed from the brilliant @heidifiedler, I loved her word this year and the image she chose. Trust. It seems simple enough, right? The dictionary calls trust an act or the act of being confident; surety; confident expectation of something; hope. Trust that stepping forward, one foot in front of the other is exactly where you should be going. Trust, that the choices you make on your path are the ones meant for you at that time and in that place. Trust, that the universe takes those hopes, dreams, goals and even secret wishes of your soul and carries you down the road as you move forward without ceasing. But truly it’s no small thing, this issue of trust. Especially when you consider all of the stumbling blocks, the bumps, the giant road signs that say “turn around you’re going the wrong way” and the many other forces working to thwart our path. Some of our own making, perhaps even most. Sometimes pressing forward, means taking a step back. Sometimes it means trusting that the universe knows what is best despite what your heart may want. When approached with some truly difficult choices recently my initial reaction was to fight, to push against the natural course of things for a number of reasons but most of all because of fear. Fear of loss. Fear of comfort. Fear of change. It was selfish above all else. But when I had time to step back (the CrossFit competition definitely helped) and listen to what path needed to be taken my heart knew what was right. It’s not that I’m backing down from pushing forward or losing myself or my passions, but making space and trusting that in time things will be as they should. We all have to trust the path we are on and find our way. Trust. And then fight with all our hearts for what we want and who we are. Be confident and have hope that the dreams and desires in our hearts will be realities one day. Work for them. Trust that they’ll be real. Trust. #trust #bepresent #life

So, to say that this week has been eventful is putting it lightly, but today I capped everything off by competing in my second ever #crossfit competition, this time with my good friend Alicia @asab204. We went in not necessarily to win, but to get three great workouts (all day!) and to have fun. I’d definitely say we were successful! On top of that, I did something I never thought I’d be capable of...a partner carry up a hill. It was difficult, we fell once, but it happened! And damn I feel like I accomplished something big today. It was great to be able to do this with such a good friend by my side and the support of so many others that came including @apsmith227, @edensidneysmith, and my awesome coach @kassiheidemann and of course LOGAN!! And I’m extremely grateful for the numerous pep talks and words of encouragement I got from my other coach @billgrundler. Not to mention the many friends from near and far that sent me messages today cheering us on, thank you! The fact that just over a year or so ago I went from not being able to do a squat properly ten times in a row to now competing, being capable of doing jumping air squats and now partner carries has so much to do with all the coaching and care I’ve received at @crossfitinferno. I know Bill will say a lot has to do with my own efforts, but without his and the other coach’s guidance and support I would likely still be fumbling along in the dark. It means the world to me and I’m truly so grateful! Now, time to rest, recover and get ready for the next thing! 😉 #crossfitgirls #slocountygames #crossfitinferno

May Finn and I take this moment to introduce you to what we believe is going to be THE book of the year? @litajudge has masterfully crafted, written and illustrated MARY’S MONSTER, the story behind the author of one of the most iconic stories of all-time, Mary Shelley’s FRANKENSTEIN. If I’m being honest I was hooked when I heard the name Mary Shelley, but when I then heard it paired with Lita Judge I knew this was going to be a phenomenal read and it doesn’t disappoint. This fully illustrated story is the essence of what’s at the heart of the resilient women marching in today’s world, a fight and spirit that can’t be stopped no matter the challenges ahead. It’s out in bookstores everywhere today and both Finn and I would urge you to pick up a copy as soon as possible! You won’t regret it! #graphicnovel #illustration #yalit #mglit #kidlit

A little #tbt lunch break special today featuring a much younger Alan and myself both rocking our chosen hair colors of that time period. I will say though, Alan and those bleached tips never fail to get compliments. Ha! Also, the scratch/bruise on my elbow is proof that I’ve always been just as clumsy and easy to bruise back then as I am now. Haha. #love #throwback

Oh, to be this blissed out...not that I’m not, but a cat nap would certainly be nice right about now or some time. I mean, doesn’t he look so relaxed? Also, did I mention that #passion is my word this year and boy is it happening. Work is bringing it. And I love it. Now, to get all the things done and maybe just maybe take a cat nap or two...😉😹❤️🔥 #wordoftheyear #passion #catsofinstagram #agentlife

Not too long after I began my career as an agent I had the incredible opportunity of sitting down with some very important film folks to pitch a few projects. One of the best compliments I’ve ever received regarding my career and how I approach sharing my client’s work came as a result of this meeting. It was said that I, “lit up immediately at even the mention of my client’s work; that I came to life talking about their work. And if anyone I ever worked with knew or could see me in action they would hold on tight and never let me go because I was a rare thing indeed.” This compliment has stayed with me ever since, but over the years I’m worried my spark has fizzled a bit. Perhaps too much of a creative soul for my line of work, I take everything to heart and have allowed a few hard hits to sink deeply into my well-spring of passion and drive for what I truly love about my job. I’m in love with my work and I feel so so fortunate to have found agenting when I did. This year though, in 2018, I reclaim what is mine. I’m taking my heart back from the soul crushing experiences, from those whose passion and desires weren’t in line with my own, from the paths that weren’t the right ones and the right time, and again deeply feel that passion and love burn within me for the work I am a part of. This year’s word, 2018, I thought was going to be reclaim but after a great deal of pondering what I feel is best is, PASSION. As it says in good old Merriam-Webster, passion is defined as “an intense desire or enthusiasm for something.” I will have that about each and every project going out into the world, each client, each conversation, every interaction and more. I’m putting everything into this this year, and I can’t wait to see the results! #wordoftheyear #passion #reclaim #2018goals #agentlife #lupinegrovecreative

Because lifting 300 lb. #deadlifts followed by a classic @billgrundler @crossfitinferno workout of chest-to-bar pull-ups and overhead squats wasn’t enough... I then spent the better part of my #mlkjrday raking the largest leaf pile I’ve ever seen in my life. Wish there was a before picture honestly, it was such a huge mess and on a hill! All of this to begin Eden’s first ever vegetable garden, which is adorable! As a reward...One of @apsmith227’s amazing cookies. I think I really earned it today, right @kassiheidemann?

This guy. Already killing it in 2018. Alan made a #60lbPR to hit a #415lbs back squat! Not a bad way to start off the new year! Tested mine and got a new PR as well to put me at #210lbs on my back squat, which wasn’t bad considering I had food poisoning last week. Trying to start 2018 off in a big way with all the PRs! 💪🏼 #powerlifting #powerliftingwomen #crossfit #crossfitgirls #backsquat

Funny, when I look at these pictures it’s hard to believe they were all this past year. So much happened this year and yet it also feels like such an interesting mixed bag of a year. Some really good good things and some low lows, but what this best-of shows me is that I’m living a pretty good well-rounded life. All the things I love are represented here: my family, good friends, work and books, Crossfit, my health and fitness, the inspiration I get from my children and of course...my kitties. What a life I have! So much there to be grateful for and so much more to come!

Almost a new year, and I was finally feeling more like a human than I have in weeks, so I figured it was a good time to get my hair done by the fabulous @amanda_nichole_duckett and @twigandarrowsalon. I never thought I’d love having my hair so dark again, but I’ve seriously been head over heels for it the last couple of times Amanda’s done it. Plus she’s just amazing! If you live near SLO I highly highly recommend her! Now time to get thinking about all of those goals and ideas I’ve got percolating for 2018. It’s going to be a great year, I can already tell. From things with my fitness and getting the chance to work with @kassiheidemann on my nutrition/fitness and of course continuing to work with the awesome @billgrundler at @crossfitinferno on my Crossfit to everything I’m doing with my business. This year I have big plans for @lupinegrove, including the expansion of the agency by bringing on another agent and looking to make the agency even more diverse than it already is in who we are working with. I’m grateful to be able to keep working with @bri_dummar and my incredible list of talented clients, we have so many books coming out this year and many sales to be announced! It’s going to be a fantastic 2018!!! #killingit #agentlife #2018goals #crossfitgoals #nutritiongoals #powerliftinggoals #powerlifting #crossfitgirls #powerliftingwomen

Well, as they say...things are gettin real around these parts. 2018 is going to be the year of knocking out some pretty hefty goals I’ve got lined up and my Christmas gifts this year kicked it off in a big way. I’ve been planning on and wanting to compete more this coming year, not only in #Crossfit competitions but in powerlifting and one big thing I needed was a belt. So, Alan got me a professional @inzer_official lifting belt for when I finally sign up for my first competitions! 💪🏼 He also got me this awesome @doughnutsanddeadlifts hoodie that I thought was completely sold out! He’s too good!!! ❤️❤️ It totally made up for being down with the worst case of food poisoning ever over Christmas, and all I can say is that I’ve gotten all my sickness out for the foreseeable future (*knocks on all the wood*). We had a great Christmas and I’m honestly so grateful we were home together sharing a quiet relaxing time with each other. Now here’s to 2018 and all that is to come!!! #merrychristmas #merrychristmas2017 #inzerbelt #powerliftingwomen #powerlifting #crossfitgirls #crossfit #powerlifter #crossfitter

It’s not Christmas around these parts until we’ve watched Home Alone 1&2. “That was the sound of a tool chest rolling down the stairs.” There are so many great hilarious lines and moments!

What can I say? I’m a #starwars girl at heart. I cried buckets the day Carrie Fisher died and this bracelet felt like the most fitting way for me to honor her and also serve as a continual reminder to stand-up and #resist, because in the end love will always win. These were my two big purchases from our #DisneyWorld trip and I couldn’t be happier. #bb8 #iloveyouiknow #jediatheart #love #resistance @alexandani

So good to be home and hangin with my two favorite kitties. They’ve both been purring non-stop and Ash even took a nap next to me, which he never does. That said these guys,  especially Ash, are mischievous as all get out! We had the best help and @maryweberauthor’s daughter Rilian took awesome care of these guys, but they gave her a run for her money and even got into the Christmas presents!!!! Turkeys. Even after they destroyed two of their own Christmas presents I can’t help but be happy to see them. They make being SICK AS ALL GET OUT so much easier to handle. ❤️ 😻 #cat #catsofinstagram

By far one of my favorite pictures from the week. Eden has been collecting signatures and meeting characters all week, but this one was an absolute highlight today! We LOVE Baymax and she was so excited to give him a hug in person! So adorable!!! ❤️ #bighero6 #disney #disneyworld #epcot #baymax

What do you do while on vacation at #DisneyWorld and you and the girl come down with the flu of death? Well, you stay in bed and watch Mickey cartoons of course!! ❤️ Thank goodness we have a few more days! We should be feeling better after a day of rest, I think we may have just done too much and hung out in the petri-dish more than we normally do. 😉😂😊 Also, did I mention that we happened to pick the Animation Resort to stay in? Because of course we did! I ❤️ Illustration!!! #happiestplaceonearth #happiestplaceonearthtobesick? #disney #artofanimationresort

“Well, they’re Eden’s favorite chips so why can’t I like them too?!” - Ash, the cat who thinks he’s a human. Earlier today I came home to discover his head buried in an almost empty bag of @plentils Margherita Pizza flavored lentil chips. He begs for them every time Eden chows down on them and it totally cracks us up. They don’t really have anything bad in them, so I’m not sure they’re terrible for him, but not exactly cat food...🙄😂 #catsofinstagram #finnandash

Too much. This is likely one of my favorites of this girlie from this past summer. A girl whose heart is so much like my own, whose energy and drive to do more and be more is equally if not more driven. She is both a source of frustration and inspiration, but always one of immense love. ••• This week has been a rough week. In many ways I’ve felt like this sweet girl here, an island alone on the shore trying to figure things out feeling misunderstood and unheard. ••• So often in my life I have the repeated the theme of friendship and how to balance or even attain it, which for me is not at all. I can’t seem or simply don’t seem to handle friendships well at all. More often than not I mess up. I seem to open my big mouth and say something sarcastic or truthful that shouldn’t be said for social reasons and I’ve suddenly become the pariah of the group — if I wasn’t already. I discover again why it’s best for me to keep my head down, focus on what I’m good at (my work) and move forward. ••• Love deeply. My problem. Just this, I love and care too deeply. In every interaction I’ve always strived and longed for deeply connected relationships, shared stories and understanding of how the world works for the other. It takes time, investment, concern and love. And I long for it in return. Which is why I am so very grateful for this delightful girl and her incredible heart, passion and soul. She meets me and pushes me to try harder and love deeper, to not be afraid of my hearts desires. To live with a whole heart, out-loud. #friendship #love

Today is my 39th turn around the sun! The last year has been anything but what I expected, truly, but I’m grateful. Grateful for my family, friends, clients, work, passion, life, renewed interests, love and so much more. This year more than ever I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to rise up and discover who I am at my core. It’s been challenging and made me dig deeper than ever before, but it’s been more than worth it. I can honestly say the person I am and becoming is the person I want to be and was born to be. And I wouldn’t be able to be on this path without so many of you in my life. Thank you all so so much. Love to you all!!! And a big thank you to @stacy.ebert for this incredible birthday art that is so perfectly fitting I can hardly believe it! 💗🎂💗 #Repost @stacy.ebert ・・・ HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!@agentdaniellemsmith Hope you had the sweetest birthday with layers of joy and fun!!

Thankful today...for not counting macros hahaha! This is THE pie! The “secret” family chocolate cream pie that Alan made for me all those years ago, a pie his grandmother told him only to make for THE girl. Ha! Little did I know...little did he know! It really is the best pie and he truly is the best guy, husband, dad and friend I could have ever had the  good fortune of meeting and falling in love with. I’m so grateful for him. So thankful for his support of my business, his and my family’s love and support of the work I do, and so much more. So thankful for my kiddos, my family near and far, and for all the goodness in my life. So much. What a year. ❤️🥧❤️

When you don’t know you need something until you open it and you suddenly burst into tears in the middle of a crowded parking lot. Boy am I so fortunate to work with not only some of the most talented people in the publishing business, but also some of the kindest and most thoughtful. What’s not pictured here that I’ll share later are a stack of prints from illustrator and all around amazing person, Neesha Hudson (@neeshas_art). So so grateful.

Obligatory morning before school #halloweencostume pictures. I’m pretty sure Jace was scowling under that Kylo Ren mask, and not just because he was in character...ha! Honestly can’t think of a better combo for these two right now, and strangely enough Eden is not much of a Star Wars fan unlike the rest of her family who are all total nerds. She just gets it by default I suppose? Haha! #starwars #kyloren #rey #reystarwars #halloween

Seriously...who turned up the thermostat? Photos taken yesterday and today in near 100 degree heat with no air conditioning because, well, it’s not supposed to get this hot here in October!!! Poor Finn!! He’s been lounging everywhere just trying to stay cool. Me, on the other hand, I’m just trying to stay upright and awake. I managed to bruise my tailbone and I’m finding it rather difficult to sit for extended hours at a time. So lots of working while at the kitchen counter on my laptop today!

#Reposting this from my lovely client, @britjanee. I’ve been thinking about this quote ever since she posted it because I’ve always felt like the outsider, always. Always the odd man out, the one that didn’t quite fit or play by the rules. And you know what? As I get older, I don’t care! Because instead I know who I am and what good I can do in the world. So hell yes I’m going to help create a brand new wonderful world with incredible clients like @britjanee and the many others I work with. I’m so grateful to do the work I do and to be in a position to influence kids in such a positive and powerful way. ❤️ ・・・ #Repost from @listenlucy #literacy  #reading #agentlife #bepresent #knowthyself #quotes

Back home tonight after a whirlwind get away with two of my most favorite people on the planet, my sisters @bri_dummar & @lularoejillybean. We spent the last twenty-four hours celebrating Bri’s birthday at @disneyland’s Halloween Party. Seriously this was SO MUCH FUN!!! We walked in to every ride you can imagine, there was trick-or-treating and tons of awesome costumes! We had a blast! Not to mention, I was able to spend so much time with my two sisters. I rarely get to see them and as we get older we all recognize how much we need each other. It was so good just to be with them. And yes, we all picked up new Mickey ears! Bri got Jack ears from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Jill got super cute sequined Minnie ones, and mine are clear holographic Star Wars ears. 😄 #somuchfun #bepresent #sisters #disneylandhalloween

Funny side-by-side comparison of my brand new @nike #metcon3 shoes along side Alan’s that he’s had for awhile now. I mean, holy cow I have tiny feet compared to this beast of a man I’m married to I guess. Hahaha! I’ve had my #metcon2’s for about a year now and really needed a new pair, so I was stoked when we found these on the way home today at the Camarillo outlet for a killer deal. Plus I LOVE the colors!! Yay! 💖 #crossfit #crossfitgirls #crossfitmom #powerlifting #powerliftingchicks

Grateful. 💛💛 Today we came home from a very quick trip to LA to see Alan’s Grandma Smith whose health isn’t doing so well. We wanted to be sure the kids had an opportunity to spend time with her and fortunately she was in wonderful spirits and even cracked a few jokes. It was a bittersweet trip as we simply don’t know how much time we have left with her and love her so much, but are grateful for every moment we have and know she’s lived an incredible life (almost 95 years!). 💛💛 When we arrived home on our front walkway were pumpkins. So many pumpkins. No note, no sign of who might have left them (I have a few ideas), but they were and are a delight. This time of year is one of my favorite and this weekend I’d actually been hoping to take the kids to pick up pumpkins but knew it wouldn’t be possible. Fall and Halloween just aren’t the same without them. So, a HUGE THANK YOU to the incredibly thoughtful and wonderful soul(s) who brightened our weekend and coming days. It’s truly just what we needed to come home to. 💛🎃💛 #grateful #friends #love

Some days I’m so grateful we have a home gym. Yesterday and the night before were two of those days. Yesterday there simply wasn’t enough time in the day to get into @crossfitinferno and the day before I really wanted to get in another #deadlift workout. Plus I love seeing the kids create and do their own workouts! • I’ve been working hard on increasing both my strength as well as my stamina during tough workouts and it’s been paying off. Last night was a #backsquat workout of 3 sets of 5 starting at #120lbs increasing to #135lbs with the last set at #145lbs where I ended up getting 10 reps. Followed by a workout of 5x10 @ #85 with weighted sit-ups between sets. • The night before was #deadlifts... 5 reps @185#/220#/235# And then 5x10 Reps @130# with 10 Reps of hollow body rocks 10 reps weighted sit-ups Between each of those five x10 sets. • I’m so hesitant to share this video of myself lifting because it’s not pretty. The lighting was bad, the angle was bad and I just generally was taking the struggle bus. That said, there were 7 reps @ #235 that I didn’t think I could do a couple of weeks ago after a huge hit to my brain processing things after the competition. So I share it simply because I’m grateful to be back in the groove and back doing what gives me clarity, back doing what gets me back at work day in and day out. These are the things that help give me the courage to go on striving for more when the world seems so out of control and I love it. #crossfit #crossfitmom #crossfitgirls #powerliftingwomen #powerlifting

What’s better than getting pampered when you really need it? Getting pampered while the most adorable puppy ever sits on your lap! @edensidneysmith was so excited to see Cinder and @amanda_nichole_duckett today @twigandarrowsalon!

Determination. It’s something in the core of who I am as a person. What’s more enjoyable though is to see it in my children. This is Eden at the @battleroyalecomp just over a week ago, head down eyes forward focused and determined to get to her goal. This girl and her brother make me so proud continually. This competition was no exception. She challenged herself and did things that kids twice her age don’t even think about doing, and yet she thought they would be fun! She was determined to do the three workouts that day and she did, with her incredible partner (and sometimes coach) by her side @johnpenner96. Eden has so much heart and is so fierce, I see so much of myself in her but to the infinite degree. She is a force for good and I have no doubt that in the future whatever she decides to put her mind to she will first be determined to see it through and second live it to the fullest. So proud. ❤️❤️ #crossfitmom #crossfitkids #crossfit #crossfitgirls #crossfitfamily #rowing #hangclean #pullups #crossfitcompetition @crossfit @crossfitkids @crossfitinferno @billgrundler @changed_it_again

How I love this proverb so much! These last few days have been so busy, more than I can even explain. So many good things happening that I honestly can't complain, but I'm so in need of both of these things and maybe some chocolate. My cheeks long to feel the soreness the only comes from having smiled and laughed uncontrollably for hours on end, my eyes are worn and long for a few peaceful nights without interruption, and I most certainly have been craving all of the most delectable treats I love. Soon, perhaps. First I need to make it through the week. 😉💜 #bepresent #riseup #agentlife ・・・ Repost @landeelu ・・・ I do plenty of the first...need a lot more of the second. 😴 But I must have some Irish blood in me because these are usually my first go-to "cures" too!

Today was a day. Let's just say we all may be sleeping the entire day tomorrow if you need anything. Not certain my brain is coherent enough to form many thoughts at this point, but I'll just say a few things... Crossfit competitions are unlike any other competition ever; you die each and every workout and have to do multiple ones in the span of a few short hours. It felt like hours between heats and then suddenly the clock was ticking down 3...2...1...GO! Next, as with WODs, what seems easy is the most horrible, gut-wrenching, take-you-to-the-ugliest-place-ever and make-you-want-to-barf workout. That was the dumbbell snatch workout for me, which I typically love, but having to hold a 35# dumbbell overhead while Alan did 8reps of db snatches then 8burpee box jumps then 8 more reps of db snatches nearly killed me. I am so unbelievably in awe of both Alan and Eden. One, Alan supported and carried the team tbh. He truly sees in me what I not often can never see and always believes in me. Today was no-exception and he blew me away with how strong and capable he was. Eden, this girl has a game face! She makes me so proud each and every time I see her work and push. Today, her and her amazing partner @johnpenner96 placed in 12th just above our 13th. They both worked SO hard and I'm so grateful to Johnny for stepping in and being such a great partner to her. This picture was taken by my dear friend @curiouscupcakekt, thank you!!!! It's my favorite of the two of us, maybe ever. Thank you, Alan, for pushing me, for helping me, for loving me despite myself, for all of it. I had a blast! Really! Congratulations to all of the competitors and especially my friends from the 8:25 Nipomo class...you know who you are! 😉 Last but not least, thank you to everyone @battleroyalecomp and @crossfitinferno for putting on an amazing event! With a special thanks to our judge @emarlow927 for pushing me to dig down and GO! What a day!!!! Now to eat a cookie, watch Outlander and sleep! #crossfit #crossfitcompetition #battleroyale #battleroyale2017 #crossfitinferno #crossfitgirls #girlswholift #asyourself #riseup @billgrundler

About twelve hours from now I throw my competition hat back in the ring @crossfitinferno for the #crossfit @battleroyalecomp. This is the first competition I've participated in in quite a few years, but to say I'm a stranger to it is a mistake. Growing up beginning at age seven competing at flute and music competitions was a regular occurrence all the way up through my late twenties. My high school years were filled with swim meets where I once slammed the wall pad so hard in a race I jammed my finger, much to parents chagrin. There was always something about the energy, despite the nervousness of it all. The challenge and the drive to do better. I've always been a competitive person and so maybe I'm a little nervous about tomorrow...I'm not as fit as I used to be, as healthy, as thin, as unjaded or undistracted. But one thing that hasn't changed is my heart. Last year at this same time I couldn't get through 10 of each squats, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups, push presses, or overhead squats, but today if I would I have gone in to do the workout I would have hit a new PR of #305 on my #deadlift and tomorrow I'm competing and finishing three workouts. I feel accomplished and truth be told I'm excited. #riseup #crossfitgirls #crossfitmom #crossfitter #asyourself #bepresent #deadlifts #crossfitcompetition

Team shirts and shirts for the kids for Saturday's #crossfitcompetition @crossfitinferno @battleroyalecomp came in today from @wodordieapparel! I wish I could have taken a picture of Eden's face when I showed her the shirt for her that says, "Strong Like Mom" because I would save it forever! She's going to rock her workouts this weekend! I'm so proud of her and so excited to be teamed up with Alan! It's going to be a blast! 💪🏼💪🏼🎉🎉 Also, gotta love the photobomb by Eden lol

This little guy (Ash) and his brother, Finn, are exhausted. Yes, that is a mouse version of Chewbacca he's sleeping with, it goes everywhere with him. Both made it through their neuter surgery okay and Ash's heart murmur subsided long enough for everything to go really well. The only hiccup...we discovered Ash gets just as hangry if not more than Eden if he hasn't had food recently and may have laid into the vet assistant after waking up from surgery. Oops! We're just so happy they're both home and resting. What a week! Anyone else ready for the weekend??? #catsofinstagram #chewbaccakittytoyftw

One of the best Labor Days in a long time. So much fun spending time with friends I've made this year from @crossfitinfernonipomo. Truly, #crossfit has changed my life in more ways than I can explain. It's more than the exercise, eating and overall wellness. It's about making friends who are there for you when things are good, bad and just to have a great time. It's a community I am grateful to be a part of and am even more grateful for the friendships I've made because of it. #thankful #rise #riseandgrind #crossfitcommunity

Click through to @thepickygirl's bio for the GoFundMe link to support her parents, both recently retired teachers who lost everything in Hurricane Harvey and had no flood insurance because they didn't live in a flood plain. Devastating. 💔 #Repost @thepickygirl ・・・ Friends, it is not easy to ask for help, but I'm asking it for my sweet, hardworking parents. My father just retired from teaching. My mom retired from teaching as well. They were already concerned because of changes to Texas and its retired teacher healthcare plans raising in price. This is their neighborhood; their home is STILL underwater, and it's unlikely that we can salvage much if and when we can get to it. They had no flood insurance because they were not in a flood plain. If you can give anything, I'd so appreciate it. But I'll take your good and encouraging thoughts just as much.

Proof that I'm not always the one working out and/or just watching Eden workout. Alan just doing a little #crossfit WOD this morning in our home gym that also included sprints down the road in front of our house. I'm honestly so impressed by his dedication and hard work. On top of this he did some gymnastics accessory work and was able to get four sets of four ring dips in a row. I'm so proud of him! #crossfit #crossfitter #homegym #myhubbyrocks @roguefitness @trainhylete @apsmith227 @billgrundler

Normally I would hesitate to post something like this, but I couldn't help this. Tonight was back to school night and in Jace's 5th grade class this year his teacher is focusing on being thankful, thoughtful and active listeners/participants. All things I feel so passionate about and am so grateful he has a teacher who feels equally passionate about them. So when I arrived at his desk to discover this little letter to me along with this drawing my heart melted quite a bit. Honestly, I almost lost it right then and there. Those bees!!! This letter!!! I hope he'll forgive me for posting it, I was just so so proud of it. 💖🐝

Look what arrived!! Agent copies of TWINDERELLA by Corey Rosen Schwartz and @deborahmarcero!! I'm so proud of this pair and this book! The crowning moment was last night when Eden read it before bed and then came out to tell us how much she loved it. 💙 TWINDERELLA comes out September 5th!

Well, I tried to take an earlier picture of my breakfast but I was too dang hungry this morning! To be honest this was a first. I very recently started working with Megan Burkett (@amazonrows) on my nutrition and trying to dial in my macros. First of all, I'm so excited to have someone with so much enthusiasm and knowledge helping me! Second, even though it's only the first few days I can tell it's already starting to make a difference because...I'm HUNGRY! I never ever get hungry normally. I know this seems weird, it is! Which is part of why my metabolism is jacked up! So these @kodiakcakes with blueberries and a small small amount of whipped cream this morning had ZERO chance of surviving. I'm so excited to see where go from here and how things progress, especially how it will change and help my life and the life of my kiddos as we all try to eat a more balanced lifestyle. #macros #kodiakcakes #breakfast #pancakes #pancakesunday

First day back at the #Grind and I manage to leave @crossfitinferno with three #kettlebells courtesy of @crossfitnortherninferno and @danica_boyle (thank you!!!). What a WOD @billgrundler! Thrusters, then Wall Balls/T2B and Pull-ups, dang. Nice to be back at it after that rib was out. Looking forward to more and getting back in my groove. #crossfit #crossfitgirls #girlswholift #emomofdeath

Kitties resting after a rough morning trip to the vet for vaccines and a checkup. Both are pretty healthy except we found out that Ash has a fairly bad heart murmur and may not be able to undergo any type of surgery in the near future. Thankfully they said he will hopefully grow out of it, but needs regular checkups for awhile. Sort of love that Finn has his hand on Ash in this pic, it seems so fitting. Love these guys. ❤️😻 #kittensofinstagram #catsofinstagram #agentlifewithkittens

No words...Ash is a kitty unto his own. I do believe he thinks he is a human. Also, my posture isn't much better today. My back is almost completely out after getting sick earlier this week.

"DAMN" indeed @billgrundler. I suppose this makes me an official #crossfitter or maybe just dumb for not having good grips for the bar yet. My first bad rip and it's a doozy. A 28 minute #emom of 4 heavy #cleans, 16 #toestobar, 12 #deadlifts and 20 #hollowbody and after about five rounds my hands were done.

Obviously I post A LOT of sleepy kitty pics, but this one...I'm so happy they're both getting back to feeling better! We took them to the Vet for their first check-ups and shots, which went well we thought, but both Ash and Finn reacted extremely poorly to the vaccines and slept for nearly 24 full hours. When Finn finally woke up he limped around and couldn't use both back legs! It scared me to death! But thankfully it didn't last and the Vet has been great about checking in to see how they are doing. Tonight both Ash and Finn even got back to their usual selves and tried to sabotage Alan and my efforts to fold the laundry, so they've got to be feeling better! One of the things the Vet said though was that one way we know they really love each other is that they will sleep together or near each other (which they almost always have to do). I love this! I never thought these two little guys would so quickly become a part of our family and home, but I can't imagine what is was like before they were here. 😻❤️ #kittens #love

A collection of recent sleeping kitties. Because really, who could not love seeing Finn and Ash sleeping? These two are so adorable!

There are some stories and some people so near and dear to you that it's hard to speak about them. This book, MY HEART IS A COMPASS, and this author, Deborah Marcero, is one of those situations. Deborah has been with me for a very long time and this will be our ninth book sold together. Though it feels like we've worked together for minutes it also feels like we've always known each other. She is a delight. A rare soul and all who have the pleasure of working with and knowing her know what I'm talking about. This book took almost a year in revisions for it to come to this place of finally being announced to the world. So when someone tells you not to give up, to try something different, to look into the depths of your imagination and discover hidden gems, much the way her wonderful editor, Mary-Kate Gaudet did, than do it! Don't lose hope. Never do. So proud of Deborah and so grateful to Mary-Kate and Little Brown. You are all going to fall in love with this blue haired little girl come Fall 2018! 💙 #love #agentlife #lupinegrovecreative #bepresent #kidlit #kidlitart #kidsbooks #childrensbooks

Up early this morning to take Alan's parents to see the tide pools at Montana de Oro. They've been here all this week and have never been to see the tide pools before, so we knew we needed to go! We saw sea stars, sea urchins, crabs 🦀, muscles and so much more. It was so incredible! There was a wonderful state park representative who helped us to hold one of the sea urchins and talked to the kids about the different types of sea life living in the tide pools. Again, how did we get so fortunate to live somewhere so incredible? On the way back, and perhaps as a payback for missing today's @crossfitinferno #WOD, the kids traded off having me carry them on my back on the trail back to the car. Talk about a workout!  #greatday #ocean #bepresent #love

"FAKE NEWS!!" - Eden's basic response to this meltingly adorable photo I found of her three years ago at age five. Ha!! She didn't believe it could possibly be her, that small and different. But yes, it was indeed her. How is it possible she's gotten so big before my eyes. Time really is fleeting. And no matter how present I might feel at times it still feels slippery, seeping through my hands more quickly than I can grasp it. For now though I will cherish what I have and remember that life is what we make of it. ❤️ #love #bepresent #life

Reminded of this from a new cover by @kinagrannis of one of my favorite songs from my high school years, THE MIDDLE by @jimmyeatworld. If you haven't heard either the cover or the original I highly encourage you listen to both! Some times things feel like they aren't moving fast enough (or maybe that's just my emailing/typing ability?), maybe your friends are "doing better" than you, or possibly life is simply tough and feeling like it's falling apart. I have always found the lyrics to this song not only comforting, but encouraging. "It just takes some time Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride Everything, everything will be just fine Everything, everything will be all right" Everything always does seem to work out and you know what? It doesn't need to be good enough for someone else, just good enough for you. What are you trying to reach for? Where are you trying to move forward to? Don't pay attention to the herd, focus on your goals and dreams and remember to be kind. Love. Be generous. Most of all, with yourself. Always. Be yourself.  #love #bepresent #life #music #jimmyeatworld #kinagrannis #themiddle #enough #live #beyourself

Ash's preferred sleep position. Though usually his arms are sprawled out as well. Such a silly kitty. He's keeping me company as I catch up on a little work I missed during an afternoon nap to knock out a sudden migraine which is thankfully gone. I'm grateful for the company. 💖 #kittens #agentlife

Driving by the #AlamoFire this morning on our way to Alan's next CrossFit competition thinking and discussing with the kids about the firefighters we know and appreciate. We've driven by the reservoir where the fire is and it's not too far from our home (not too close either) and seeing the sky covered in orange & brown with giant plumes of white mushroom clouds looming overhead reminded us all how fortunate we are to have so many brave men and women in our lives. #CrossFit has brought us closer to the community of firefighters, but I've always been overwhelmingly proud first and foremost of my cousin Bert Brown @jb_3757. He's always been an example to me of integrity, honesty, kindness, bravery and above all has always been an incredible family man with the most wonderful family. The other #firefighters we've come to know in the box like @johnpenner96, Justin Williams, Jacob Sanchez and of course @billgrundler and @craigbrooks5000 among many others I'm sure I'm missing. Thank you guys for going out every time there is a need and doing what is called for, even in over 100 degree heat climbing mountains. You're heroes, each of you! #Repost @gottabesmee ・・・ 🚒 He's one of the good guys. 🚨

There's a chance I just discovered a new way to get work done during the summer...I officially have #kittenminions! I told Eden I was sorry, but she would just have to stay outside and play because both kittens couldn't be disturbed during their designated door  guarding time. Hahahaha!!! I love this new plan! Also, it just so happened that Jace was outside too! #bonus #allthework #agentlife #agentlifewithkittens

As one does on the the beach...squats. Or at least as a #Crossfit kid does. Ha!  A much needed trip to the beach this evening. Jace was away at a birthday party and both Eden and I have been wanting to go. So, dinner at the beach it was! Breathing in the ocean water, feeling the sand in my toes, hearing the waves crash...all of it. Just what I've been needing. Grateful this is only minutes from our home. #slolife #beachgirlatheart #bepresent

This lady right here, is amazing. Tonight we made a killer team and both PR'd our #frontsquat; Nicole at #200lbs and myself at #175lbs. We make an amazing team, but I'm even more grateful to call her my friend. So grateful that #Crossfit has brought us together and also introduced me to so many incredible people I would have never known without my home away from home. I also happened to row more than I ever have before tonight with 2k meters under my belt in under the 15 minute time cap along with some push presses between rows! Killer workout @billgrundler! And awesome coaching @craigbrooks5000!! Loved every minute of it, whether it was the workout or the people...it was phenomenal. #girlswholift #crossfitlife #crossfitgirls #crossfitter

Today I had the good fortune of talking with one of my talented and lovely authors. They reminded me of this very quote about myself and yet again helped me to remember how crucial the partnership is that I have with the clients I chose to work with. We lift and support one another in ways we sometimes don't know. This week and the one prior has been good, but deeply dug down in the trenches of work and the nitty gritty that sometimes leaves me less inspired and more plain exhausted, frazzled and even stressed. Is that bad? No. Life is not always inspired and sunshine, but this morning I was unknowingly in need of a push to remind me of the very thing this quote mentions and how much joy I take in sharing the work of those that I love & work with. It is not born out of arrogance, but out of pure love, joy and excitement over what they (and sometimes we) have created. To send that out into the world is something truly special, it's an honor I don't take lightly and one I look forward to as often as possible. ❤ #agentlife #bepresent #love

It's official! Alan is the Kitten Whisperer! Also, a total stud. And an amazing dad and husband. Everything I do, from parenting our children to my work to Crossfit and beyond happens because he is by my side. Not only that, but he is one of the kindest and goofiest guys I know. It takes some time for his goofier silly side to come out with people outside of our family, but I'm grateful to have it in our home daily to balance my near-constant seriousness. Alan is always my balancing act, he keeps me level headed and calm and I'd like to think I do the same for him. Happy Father's Alan, love you. ❤

A little bit of a #tbt❤️ to last week spent with three of the most incredible people. We came together to heal and to meet, to care and to share in one another's light so that we might go forward with courage. There was so much love, heart and creativity. Deborah Marcero has been a client of mine for almost as long as I've been an agent (we've now sold nine, going on eleven books together) and has become a trusted friend over the years, having this opportunity to meet in person for the first of many times to come was something my heart will always remember. Chrissy Vagenius, also a brilliant and talented client was referred to me through Deborah and I will always be so so grateful. Chrissy's writing as well as her paper art illustrations are stunning and something I cannot wait for the world to know more deeply. Chrissy and I were able to spend time together after Deborah left for home and I felt so treated to something absolutely special, she is truly one of a kind and has a heart that cares deeply and richly. And Troy Cummings, though not a client he is a dear dear friend and someone who's books and heart have already made their way into our home. His imagination and joy was contagious and I couldn't help but want to take a peek into what's going on in his brain...always working. This trio was something to behold, the light and energy and love. I didn't want to leave them. They truly are something else and my heart felt Whole with each of them. I feel so grateful to have had the time I did with all three of them and I hope we are able to again soon. 💚 #bepresent #love #energy #joy #heart

Tomorrow. Oh my heart. 💙 #Repost @maryweberauthor ・・・ This pretty book comes out tomorrow. I hope people like it. 💕 And for now I'll simply say it's my latest heartbeat - my hint at what things I value, what I counsel teens & parents in, what relational struggles & the nuances I see - and the effects we all have on each other. And what questions this world should be asking now more than ever... Namely, "What is humanity & how do we retain it in ourselves? How do WE as a people stay human in the face of our own accomplishments & intentions." (And just wait for those questions on full display in book 2. Mwaha. ;)) . That said, it's also my ode to the fast-paced, fun summer romps of old skool, girl & boy sci-fi adventures (earth & entertainment-oriented rather than hardcore sciency descriptive ;)). It's gamer-girl taking on the world. Sibling care & protection. Hispanic boy being different than the labels everyone believes. It's politics & parenting & an alien ice planet that's abruptly appeared in our solar system beside our moon. . I truly hope you have fun with it, friends. But far more than that - I hope you know how very grateful I am to each & every one of you. For all you give to this world. And all you give to me. Thank you for continually being voices of light & life in this hard political & publishing climate. Thank you for supporting me with your kind words & beautiful fun posts I love to read & follow. And thank you for holding my heart, just as I am here, standing, holding yours too, as we do our journeying together. Most of all, thank you for the honor of your friendship. . Here's to another adventure in the world. 💕 . So much love to you all. xo ~m . #TheEvaporationOfSofiSnow #books #maryweber #NewRelease #soulfriends

As I return home from a wonderful trip to the @SCBWI Indiana  Retreat this past weekend in the beautiful Pokagon State Park I can't help but think of this phrase I found on @huntinglouise. I was so fortunate to spend time with creators, clients and friends that reminded my heart how important the work we do is and how much children & readers need it. My heart is full and my mind is swirling with thoughts. It's good. #love #energy #agentlife #scbwitribeshare #Repost @huntinglouise ・・・ Your vibe attracts your tribe 🙌🏻

Today was Eden's first attempt at the hero WOD MURPH. She was so pumped! Overall it took about 53 minutes for her to complete the mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups and 300 squats (kids omitted the last mile run). We are so proud of her!!! Also, so grateful to Craig Brooks and Amanda @crossfitinfernonipomo for organizing such a phenomenal day! She had a blast and even made a new friend! We love our @crossfitinferno family and both Alan and I are so grateful to everyone for the support and community we find there. #crossfit #crossfitkids #crossfitlife #girlswholift #murph #wod

One of the highlights of our trip to see my sister and hangout watching the #californiaregionals live was getting to see this sweet guy in person. Ozzy is gettin' up there and is just about the same age as Eden, which actually means he's great for cuddling and just generally lounging around. He's so lovable and just the absolute sweetest bulldog! It always takes Eden about three days to warm up to him and then we are just about to leave, which makes me so sad because he's really the best!! Here's his best lounging model pose...hahaha! #bulldogsofinstagram #bulldogs #englishbulldog #crossfit #crossfitregionals #regionals2017

The one and only Dane McLaughlin with Eden at #californiaregionals today! She had been dying to see him all weekend and wanted a picture with "her" athlete. Of course she was her usual shy self and could hardly ask him, even though she sees him every week in our box @crossfitinferno. She's star struck and so proud, we all are!

Eden catching a quick chat with her favorite #crossfit partner from back home @crossfitinferno @billgrundler at the CA #crossfitregionals this time with none other than his co-commentator for this Regionals  @captamericaxfit! I don't know if she gets how big a deal it is that she just knows these guys and gets to meet them, but her dad and I are stoked that she loves #crossfit as much as she does.

One of the benefits of road-tripping as opposed to flying...pit stops! Stopped in Santa Monica to try a new bakery, BSWEET, because well, come on when someone tells you there is an ice cream filled warm donut, red velvet bread or salt-caramel bread pudding do you pass up the opportunity to try it? NO. Just no. So yeah, macros...ummmm...oops. @bsweetdesserts #sogood #love #desserts #donuts #icecream #breadpudding #vacation #crossfit #crossfitregionals

BOOM!! 💥As @billgrundler said as I beat my previous deadlift PR by #50lbs to make it a #275lbsdeadlift @crossfitinferno! Also, look at @apsmith227 with a #deadliftpr  at #465lbs! Today both the kids got PRs in their @crossfitkids class too with Jace getting #85lbs and Eden with a one armed #kettlebell deadlift at #53lbs @crossfitinfernonipomo! Yes, the Smith family is a DEADLIFT family! Haha! #loveit #crossfit #crossfitlife #crossfitgirls #crossfitfamily #girlswholift

Made it all the way out to my car, dropped the kids off at school, came back in to work and realized I had my #unicorn magnet stuck to my keys. This clearly means it's going to be a magical day, right?! #damnstraight #magicintheair #mondaymotivation #magical #wolves

Found after drive home post #wod @crossfitinferno with big thanks to the Birthday guy himself, @billgrundler! Eden has been super bummed about not being able to workout due to her fractured elbow but we made an exception today because it's the weekend and she could have time to recover. Bill was awesome and obliged by scaling the workout to accommodate her one arm and she rocked the one arm #dumbbellsnatch, #reverseburpees with #boxjumpovers and a #100mrun AMRAP with four full rounds! Oh, and did I fail to mention she also did an eight minute #tabata of sit-ups and #airsquats? This little athlete never ceases to amaze me! She loves it! And I love her example! Thank you to everyone at @crossfitinferno & @crossfitinfernonipomo for always cheering her on and encouraging her. Eden continues to love it in part because of your support. 💖💪🏼💖 #crossfit @crossfitkids #crossfitkids #crossfitgirls #girlswholift

Why am I just now discovering Halsey? Seriously! This song. 💜 There is something about music that has always stirred my soul and helped me remember who I am at my core. It's something I feel deeply and part of why I've played in bands, recorded albums, done the orchestra thing and the punk thing, all ends of the spectrum because music speaks to me when nothing else will. It will find what was once lost. When I might feel like I'm wandering without a place or time it grounds me in place. Much the way books take big feelings and shape them into words and sentences that help us feel less alone, music weaves a chord around those words and feelings - experiences, to make me feel whole. It's something for me that is both out-of-body and within. Maybe this all sounds a bit out there, but it grounds me, reminds me of who I am and what my goals are and most importantly to not get lost in the sweeping deep pull of so many demanding my time. #music #bepresent #rise #love #halsey #soul #meaning #purpose
