My #nuraphone profile. Have to say I‚Äôm impressed. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be many people using this amazing invention by @nurasound for classical music. As a Sibelius fan, clarity and transparency of orchestral line is very important. Sibelius himself was known to put his ear right up to his gramophone because he wanted to hear everything. How amazed he would be if he had these. I am hearing new things and hearing old things anew. Hard to describe. I feel like I am the orchestra? Feels like I‚Äôm inside the orchestra but not as a distinct, individual listener? It‚Äôs like all around me but there is no direction the sound is coming from. Encompassed.  Every line is almost supernaturally clear. But natural. Balance is amazing, even at fortissimo. Thundercloud bass hums, fluttering flute, fairy harps and serene timpani whispers. Listening to Sibelius Sixth as I type.  First piece I tried earlier today was the slow movement of his First Symphony. Brought a tear to my eye. #headphones #audiophile #WhatsYourSound

Sibelius is unique, but he‚Äôs a bit of an acquired taste. I feel that this has to do with the idea that his music and compositional philosophy is unique to him. There is no other composer like him. He has no true heir. To appreciate his music, I think one has to let go of traditional perceptions of music. Especially as a construct. #Sibelius wrote intuitively. He had colour-sound #synaesthesia - he heard tones in colours. This along with the minimalist landscapes of Finland meant something in his music. He believed in organic development. But he did not grow musical ideas at will. He said that his job as a composer was to find the final form of his musical cells. That they were in a way predetermined. Like how we might not recognise what a seed grows into but if you nurture it, it will miraculously turn into a tree. Sibelius and nature are thus inseparable. He is, imho, the greatest musical avatar of nature. His music has an inner logic and otherworldly beauty like nature. It defies explanation with language. His First #Symphony evokes defiance and grandeur, like Finlandia. His Second is even grander and showcases his capacity for developing drive and what is best described as finality. But with his Third, Sibelius began to chart his own voice. It is an exercise in saying things just once, getting to the point of symphonic argument and no more. His Fourth was written with the threat of death hovering over him. But it‚Äôs not about death. It‚Äôs Sibelius fast-forwarding his symphonic thinking to its logical end. The Fifth is life-affirming. It is also an example of how Sibelius is a master of fusion - having merged both original first movements together. The Sixth took me the longest to understand. It is all the little things in nature. Snowflakes, little flowers, the quiet rustle of breezes among the leaves, the little gurgle of brooks, stars in the night sky, tiny perfect patterns ... this is Sibelius at his most intimate. Finally the Seventh - his ultimate symphonic end. 22 minutes in one movement, all based on one motif and ending with a massive, force-of-the-universe finality in a single C Major chord. No other composer has ever done this.

Another thrilling experience, meeting the renowned Swiss conductor Charles Dutoit. I first noticed him sitting on house left in the stalls on the Monday recital. Met and shook his hand on Tuesday backstage and on  Martha Argerich‚Äôs Wednesday concert he appeared in the foyer before it started. Such a delight! He obliged me with autograph and a photo. (He and Martha were married for a while).

Precious autograph #marthaargerich  Slightly smudged but she wrote an extra ‚Äúsouvenir‚Äù on it. I was in the same room with her and Charles Dutoit as it was signed. 12 June 2018, Esplanade backstage. #autograph #starstruck

Martha Argerich rehearsing in Singapore. In person she's quite direct, down-to-earth and approachable. Although I cannot shake that edge of legendar-iness when I speak to her. It's a little intimidating but I also sense a very interesting personality. Wish I had more time to chat with her.

What an amazing piece. The notes say you'll either love it or really really hate it. I can see why. I loved it.

Was lone cameraman at Kavakos' rehearsal this morning. Caught the one single take of the finale's conclusion. They didn't play it fully after that. Met him afterwards to get his ok. He's such a laid back, friendly guy omg. I showed him my 20 year-old review of his original Sibelius violin concerto on BIS. Forgot to bring the actual CD today though. #leonidaskavakos

I said to the @kingssingers that it was especially meaningful to me to hear them sing both "Loch Lomond" and Dick Lee's "Home" in the same concert. It's an honour. Both are pieces that have garnered strong "patriotic" sentiments over time. Of course Loch Lomond is much much older than Home, so all the more the contrast and feeling.

Mr, or rather Maestro Lim Yau is an important person to me. In 2007 when he directed Singapore's first-ever complete Sibelius symphony cycle with the @thephilharmonicorchestra, I eventually became the one to write the programme notes. This sort of got me out of retirement. And because of that, things gradually began to happen and now here I am, working in the @singapore_symphony_orchestra 's marketing team. I was very glad to be able to catch him a couple of times during rehearsal for yesterday's spectacular concert. He knows me well enough to treat me as a friend and for that I am deeply honoured. The concert was a massive success, and although most people will remember it for the astonishing Hakola Clarinet Concerto, many will also praise the beautiful, beautiful rendition of Scheherazade - and all of it conducted by Lim Yau, a man I deeply respect.

With Finnish clarinetist Kari Kriikku before and after his, frankly, astonishing performance of the Hakola Clarinet Concerto. I am glad (and also somewhat bewildered) how Finnish music continues to come into my life. Or maybe it's just that Finland produces so much musical talent. And if you missed this concert, you really missed one of the season's very best. At least the most memorable!

Its getting really hard to say which concert is the best this season, but if the spontaneous burst of cheering at this one, plus the coordinated clapping during the curtain calls is anything to go by... My goodness if this concert had a second night I'd definitely go again. BOTH the Rimsky-Korsakov Scheherazade and Hakola's Clarinet Concerto were so good. #karikriikku #limyau #singaporesymphonyorchestra

Congrats and thank you @elinavahala for coming to Singapore and introducing to everyone here the Kuusisto Violin Concerto @jaakkokuusisto - every single person I spoke to after the performance loved it! The orchestra during rehearsal was very impressed as well. Hope you come back to play in Singapore again soon! #elinav√§h√§l√§ #violin #violinist #violinconcerto #singaporesymphonyorchestra #esplanadesg #sso20172018 #ssoconcert

Delighted and honoured to meet and interview Finnish violinist Elina V√§h√§l√§ @elinavahala (video on @singapore_symphony_orchestra Facebook and IG later today). We also witnessed her rehearsal with the SSO, of Jaakko Kuusisto's Violin Concerto and honestly I found the live experience even more effective than on the BIS recording. Looking forward to the Thursday concert! #violinist #finnishmusic #finnishmusician #starstruck

"Maestro, I've always wanted to take a photo with you." I am really very humbled that our Music Director Lan Shui knows of my long history with this orchestra. I feel that as a (former) music reviewer, one must never forget humility. It's a very serious responsibility to review the work of others, especially professionals. But thankfully, Lan Shui has done so very much for classical music in Singapore. I'm full of admiration and respect for him. And he remains a completely approachable, down-to-earth man who is nonetheless an esteemed, very fine, very professional conductor whose art has become so refined over the 20 years he's been with the SSO. I wrote a review of his first concert as MD in 1997. "Now you are here." He says. #singaporesymphonyorchestra #lanshui #conductor

There are many reasons we use (or avoid) social media. But one special use I've found is following my children's teachers (generally after they "graduate") in order to help them stay in touch and in the future locate them again. Here is my littlest one's very sweet teacher through her P1-2 years. Truly blessed to have such a good teacher nurture her for two whole important years. Thank you @theblue_sunshine

#wheredatbug This cat. Found her chasing a bee. I swatted the bee to the ground here. Didn't kill it. Cat hesitated and stared at bee. Using tissue paper I picked bee up gently and threw it out the window. Then for the next hour this cat stalked this spot, waiting for the bee to "come out of hiding". No amount of plain English could dissuade her... #piathecat #blackcat #kuroneko #catsofsingapore #catstagram #helloitsgone

The talented, pretty and very tall Janine Jansen! I heard she wanted to go back for the second half (especially since her husband is conducting!) but she seems to have stayed back during the intermission to ensure every one in the queue got their autograph and some got photos too. (I waited until the very last moment). Very powerful violinist, gorgeous tone. Hope she returns - I would love to hear her play Bach. #janinejansen #violinist #singaporesymphonyorchestra #starstruck

The London Haydn Quartet - told them I'm sure I have loads of their recordings at home, from their work with such famous ensembles as the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra or the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Catherine Manson praised the VCH acoustics. Was a bit surprised by her compliment but in fact the Quartet did sound very good. (Just don't expect the big sound of modern instruments. Eric Hoeprich's basset clarinet was beautiful. Maybe period instruments better here?) #londonhaydnquartet #stringquartet #periodinstruments

Visited new office at Bencoolen St today. Very nice place and looking forward to the change of environment but will definitely miss Victoria Concert Hall - she will always be a class of her own.

#throwback The oasis of silence in the middle of #helsinki, the Kamppi Chapel. Not just pure Nordic design but truly a miracle of acoustics inside. Totally silent with busy city outside. Wanted to just sit inside for 5 minutes but ended up staying 35 minutes. Meditating and thinking in silence there recharged me, felt fresh when I left. Thank you #kiitos #silence #church #finnisharchitecture #finland

Sibelius is synonymous with Finland and also Finnish national identity. His music encompasses the Finnish landscape, Finnish soul, Finnish sounds and Finnish language. #sibelius #suomi100 #finland #finland100 #finnishmusic #throwback

Forever my first violin. I don't know how far I will go so I'm holding back my thoughts about this chapter in my life. But I can tell you that for me, learning to play the violin has felt like getting to know an old friend. I have always known how its voice is like, but now we are in conversation #learningviolin #violin #betterlatethannever

Anna Tsybuleva, absolutely not just a pretty face. She is wonderful as a pianist.

So, somewhat on a whim last Sunday I signed up for a trial violin lesson at my daughter's violin school which I bring her to every Sunday. Because 1) I've always loved the instrument 2) I need to play it myself to help my daughter learn it better 3) I need a new way to motivate her to play. Had the trial with her teacher (Joseph) at noon today (@wolfgangviolin is just a stone's throw from the Victoria Concert Hall). Felt like getting to know someone I've always known. #betterlatethannever #violin #musiclesson

Ran up to pianist Melvyn Tan as his autograph queue dissipated, told him how much I enjoyed his performance. He's got a wonderfully light touch on the piano, crystal clear articulation and to top it off, humour and wit so important in Mendelssohn. These are qualities he's been famous for in the piano circle. Glad to have witnessed it. At one point in the finale I broke into a smile at one of his clever turns of phrases. #melvyntan #singaporesymphonyorchestra #classicalmusic #pianist #pianoconcerto #mendelssohn #esplanadesg #autographsession

Brought my daughter to this Bach Cello Suites recital by Armenian cellist Khachatur Khachatryan as she's curious about the cello. Full house (or rather full church). We stayed for Suites Nos. 1 and 2 then had to go as I know my girl will get overtired. But she enjoyed it. #classicalmusic #singapore #cello

Yesterday I asked the girls if a video promo clip could be made to promote tomorrow's concert with pianist Charles Richard-Hamelin. Despite it being a late request, it was quickly arranged with the folks at Programming who host the artistes. Really impressed by the quick response. And here we are getting ready to film Charles. I asked him how to pronounce his name. His first reaction was an apologetic "it's quite difficult". But we more or less got it! Very very French name. #iworkhere #pianist #marketingmusicians
