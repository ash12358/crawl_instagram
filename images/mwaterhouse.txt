I usually don‚Äôt try to shoot the same shot twice. But in the case of this one, all of your great feedback from a similar shot last year made me want to  do it again ‚Äî with the challenge to make it different and perhaps better. Not sure this is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (I‚Äôll let you all decide) but it is a bit refined.

The Triborough and Hell Gate bridges made for a perfect scene as the annual Astoria fireworks show was carried out Thursday night. Posting both the red and white versions, as I think the red one really pops, but I like how the white fireworks light up the bridges to their natural color. Which do you like better? These were shot about 3 miles away with a superzoom lens alongside @ryandukephotography on a rooftop in Long Island City. - - - - - - - - - - #fireworks #astoria #queens #4thofjuly #fourthofjuly #independenceday #america #üá∫üá∏ #tamron #tamron150600g2 #superzoom #telephoto

Is it still considered #Manhattanhenge if it happens more than a week after the ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù date? Checked out the sunset at Long Island City‚Äôs Gantry Park with @ryandukephotography and we were greeted with perfect sunset alignment from across the East River.

What a wonderful spring night in NYC. Equipped with just my iPhone X, I set out for a walk and snapped some pics in what is arguably one of the best parks in the city. Even got a #puddlegram in there! I almost also picked the second photo as the first ‚Äî it‚Äôs more my style (I think), but the first one really pops.

Manhattanhenge wasn‚Äôt a total bust! Caught a small glimpse of the sun as it crossed along the western side of 42nd Street. If you look closely at the first photo, you can see dozens of photographers lined up taking pictures from the overpass near Grand Central Terminal. And the second photo reveals the low layer of clouds covering the top of the Chrysler Building. #manhattanhenge #sunset #manhattan #manhattanhenge2018 #gantrygram

Just a moment in the park, captured via a puddle‚Äôs reflection. Tip: Turn your phone 180 degrees to see the original perspective. Most #puddlegram shots I snap and share are taken with a wider-angle lens, and a great number of those are shot with my phone‚Äôs camera right at the water‚Äôs edge. But this one was shot with a 135mm lens ‚Äî farther from the subject (I‚Äôm not even sure these people knew they were in my frame) ‚Äî and offers a different take on this kind of photo.

The Castle of the Moors (or Moorish Castle) in Sintra, Portugal, was built as a fort in the 8th and 9th centuries by North African Muslim Moors. It was later abandoned when Christian crusaders overtook Portugal, and then was left in disarray after a fire and later a massive earthquake in the 18th century. It has since been brought back to life as a national monument that attracts visitors from around the world.‚†Ä -------------‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #sintra #portugal #adventure #travelphotography #portugalphotoadventure #europe #eurotrip #nikon #d750

A major highlight of Portugal was the Bengil Caves tour in the Algarve region (along the southern coast). Aboard a boat, we dipped in and out of more than a dozen caves -- but this one was my favorite. It's only accessible by boat (or swimming). The opening in the top allows sunlight to shine down on the sandy beach below.

Called the "funicular" -- this electric-powered street car lifts or lowers people on one of Lisbon's largest hills. Considering how each ride is 3,70 euros (about $4.50 USD), I'd say this is more of tourist driven service than one for daily commuters (and the walk isn't *that* bad) -------------‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #lisbon #portugal #adventure #travelphotography #portugalphotoadventure #europe #eurotrip #nikon #d750 #funicular #trains #transit #streetcar

Getting back after an incredible week in Portugal. What an experience! Went to Lisbon, Evora and the Lagos area in Algarve (southern Portugal). Now, so many photos to go through (nearly 3,000!).

The Tribute in Light installation is actually situated on top of a parking garage near the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, blocks from the World Trade Center site.

I had the honor of getting up close with the September 11 Tribute in Light display last year.

Had the honor of covering the #solareclipse for work (@abc7ny), capturing photos of people who were watching from atop the Empire State Building in NYC.

Cool story: Built in 1930, 40 Wall Street ‚Äî most recognized by its oxidized, green copper roof ‚Äî was the tallest building in the world. But that title was very short-lived. The designers of the Chrysler Building (which was also under construction and supposed to be slightly shorter) secretly built a 125-foot spire inside the frame of building and put it into place about a month after 40 Wall Street opened. Sneaky, right? It was originally called the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, but is now known as ‚ÄúThe Trump Building‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCrown Jewel of Wall Street.‚Äù Donald Trump acquired the building in the 1990s after it had fallen into disrepair, and he spent millions renovating it. üöÅüöÅ ------------- #helicopter #üöÅ #flynyon #trumpbuilding #40wallstreet #copper #skyscrapers #manhattan #wallstreet

As it is with all things that stray from the norm, the iconic Flatiron Building in Manhattan was met with a bit of criticism when it was built in 1902. Its unique shape didn't fit the form of the then-traditional skyscraper. Nonetheless, the triangular-shaped building has become an NYC tourist favorite. üöÅüöÅ ---------- #helicopter #üöÅ #flatiron #flatironbuilding #manhattan #flynyon

It's hard to pass up a good #puddlegram opportunity on this street. Though, Clevelanders seem to take more notice than New Yorkers of a person lying on the ground with their phone basically sitting in a puddle. Great to be back, even if for a short period.

Never miss an opportunity for a good puddlegram, especially when the World Trade Center is within sight.

At the World Trade Center 9/11 memorial, which is within eyesight of the new Oculus transportation hub, a white rose is placed with each terror attack victim's name on his or her birthday. There's isn't a day of the year without a birthday, and 6 on September 11. #sweetphotowalk #911memorial #worldtradecenter #oculus #zeiss135 #bokeh

The scene doesn't feel real. Hard to believe this busy intersection in New York City's iconic Times Square was the scene of a deadly rampage-via-car just a few days earlier. This concrete barrier was placed where a metal pole stopped the speeding car that plowed through pedestrians on the sidewalk over a three-block area. It's really a miracle more weren't killed. The barrier has since turned into a memorial for the 18-year-old tourist who died in the crash. Stuffed animals, candles and memorial messages have been left here in honor of Alyssa Elsman. #RIP #timessquare #zeiss135

The 9/11 memorial on Staten Island was designed to look like two oversized postcards that curve out like wings. It honors the 274 Staten Island residents who were killed in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Each victim is represented with their name, birthday, job title and a silhouette. #statenisland #september11 #memorial #zeiss135

Finally feeling like spring. One of my favorite places in NYC is 57th Street/Seventh Avenue at dusk. The orange glow of Carnegie Hall's lights next to the blues of the sky and surrounding buildings is hard to match. Snapped this one with my iPhone on my way home last night. #iphoneonly

I'd bet that nearly every visitor to NYC at some point sees "Big Allis" in Queens -- the power plant's red and white smokestacks are hard to miss. But few likely know its story. When it opened as a steam-based plant in 1965, the then-named Ravenswood No. 3 facility was the world's first million-kilowatt power plant, big enough to provide power to 3 million people. Con Edison first proposed it in 1962, with plans calling for it to be a nuclear plant. As you can imagine, that didn't go over well. 5 million people were located within 5 miles of the location. After the locals voiced their concerns, the plans were changed. Big Allis, named after the company that built it -- Allis-Chalmers Corporation -- now runs primarily on natural gas. #licqueens #longislandcity #bigallis #powerplant #queens #history

Manhattan and the 7 train, as viewed from the fast-growing NYC neighborhood of Long Island City. Just waiting for a clever/hipster-type name to pop up for the area. "Queensboro Plaza" isn't going to be it. Maybe something more like NoLIC for "Northern Long Island City"? #licqueens #queens #queensboro #7train #subway

NYC started the Boro Taxi system in 2013, in an effort to provide better cab access to underserved parts of the city. You can flag down a bright green one in any borough except the core part of Manhattan. #taxi #queens #astoria

Post number 1,000. I'm honored to be connected with all of you on Instagram -- and thankful to have met some of you in-person. Some say this is just another app, but I've found it to be an awesome way to see the creativity in others, and I feel like I learn so much about each of you through your snapshots of life. #queensborobridge #crane #smokestack #crane #plane

It's surprising to see how many people still try to ride bikes when there's measurable snow on the roads. Although wiping out is a definite risk, id be more worried about out-of-control cars. #snow #nycweather #weather #snowstorm #timessquare #bikes

Apparently, the umbrellas really do work. Here's another look at Times Square from a Thursday morning as the storm started to really pick up. #snow #nycweather #weather #snowstorm

Two things I love about NYC during the winter: The relentless attitude that nothing will stop progress (look at the determination on this woman's face!), and how widespread umbrellas are used during snowstorms (makes sense since walking is a way of life here -- just didn't see that much in Cleveland). #snow #nycweather #weather #timessquare #snowstorm

I was too busy covering the snowstorm for work that I didn't get a chance to post any pics here. Luckily, I was able to stop by Times Square on my way in Thursday morning... #snow #weather #nycweather #snowstorm

While in D.C., I also had the opportunity to cover the Women's March on Washington. It was the biggest gathering of people I've ever seen. As a journalist, I don't recall ever being thanked as much for coverage of a particular event as I was for this one. That was nice. Side note: Police in both DC and NYC say no arrests were made during the marches. #womensmarch #womensmarchonwashington #march #washingtondc #lowangle

D.C. is basically in lockdown until after the inauguration. Fences line most streets. I've never seen anything like it. #trumpinauguration #washingtondc #dc #president #capitol
