I'm up to 82 miles on my Onewheel odometer. I feel like I'm getting pretty good now. I can swerve through rocks and street pot holes, hop off curbs and stop and turn on a dime. Riding these things is such a unique, cool feeling. It really feels like you're just floating along. Even though I'm gaining confidence on it, I still wear all my safety gear for now. (helmet, elbow, knee pads and wrist guards). They've saved me a couple times already! #onewheel #onewheelnation #floatlife

Thanks to @scottfwalter for capturing this shot of me doing what I love while in Palouse. I believe I was shooting an IR photo here.

Farmlands with history. Inside this abandoned farmhouse is the original settlers log cabin. They build the home around the cabin, giving it a more rigid structure, and probably the reason it's still standing today, three generations later.

About a year ago I someone in town riding a OneWheel and it looked like a blast. Last month I finally gave in and ordered a OneWheel+XR. It arrived last week. Now, I've never snowboarded and never skateboarded but I threw on a helmet and gave this a shot. I will say with zero hesitation this is one of the most fun purchases I've ever made in my life. After a couple of hours of looking like a baby deer trying to learn to walk, I was zipping around pretty confidently. The greatness of this thing is it handles trails as well as pavement. It's a true adventure mobile! #onewheel #adventure

I spent most of Sunday evening in the kayak. Perfect way to end the weekend. This time we paddled up Denton Creek, which flows into Lake Grapevine. It's a wide, slow moving stream, free of log jams. Easy paddle. Highly recommend.  #photography #adventure #travel #kayaklife #kayaking #kayaks #texas

After my West Texas trip my Jeep was covered in red mud and filled with red dust. After a quick trip to the car wash, she's shiny inside and out again. I'm coming up on 3 years with the Jeep Renegade Trailhawk. It's been a great ride and it's been able to do exactly what I got it for. It totes me around with all my photography gear, camping gear, kayaking stuff and can handle some light 4x4 duties, all while getting pretty good gas millage. #jeep #trailhawk #travel #adventure #adventuretime

While standing there shooting this sunset at Caprock Canyon there wasn't anyone else around me. So I stopped shooting and just listened. I could hear a couple owls nearby and a pack of coyotes in the distance. It was bliss.

Poor little guys. I tried to save them. Each spring my neighborhood is flooded with baby bunnies. I got home from work yesterday evening. I let my dog out and about 30 seconds later I noticed she was sniffing something. I ran outside and found these 3 scattered around the yard. She hadn't been out there long enough to get to all 3, and she's more curious than killer. So im not sure what happened. I did find 2 more alive and well. I moved them to my neighbors yard where there are no dogs. 😥 #circleoflife

Going through old pics, I found this one of myself and our Great Dane, Ladamar.  He was a really good guardian. As a kid I spent a majority of my time outside, wearing those beat up overalls, probably bare foot. We were living in rural Kansas at the time. Lots of adventures.

It took two comebacks and a late game winner, but we pulled off an 8-7 win for our teams 2nd championship in 4 seasons! Super tough game. I finished with 1 goal, 2 assists and 4 penalty minutes (hooking and tripping, lame!). My nieces and nephew came out to watch. I think they had fun. GO AGELESS WONDERS! 😄 #hockey #inlinehockey #sports

Looking back at my trip into the Catacombs of Paris France. Deep below the city are tunnels with literally 100+ miles of bones stacked as you see here. It must have been a strange job to spend years on end carry piles of bones from graveyards to the deep tunnels. Fascinating place! #catacombs #death #bones #Paris #France #photography #adventure #travel

After recently talking to a friend about the Nvidia Shield and streaming TVs, I gave in and picked one up. All I can say is... Whoa. I can see why it was rated one of the best Android TV boxes you can get. It's so good in fact, after spending about an hour getting it setup, I was so impressed I called DirecTV and canceled my service I'd had since 2004. My TV bill has gone from $128 a month to $60 a month. I have cut the cord!

Did that thing today.  While walking into the building, a lady had a spot setup in the parking lot with all her candidate signs. I guess she was trying to be a one person rally. She saw me walking by, held up her sign and said "Go Republican!" I thought this was not only stupid, but pointless and uncalled for. So i smiled and said back to her.... Not this year! 😂

We had this puppy visit our office for the day. She's super sweet, great with other dogs and up for adoption! Poor girl was surrendered by her owner. Which kinda pisses me off. She's at the Denton Animal Shelter (940.349.7594). Her adoption ID is #73944.  I think she's on Petfinder too. #dogslife #dogsofinstagram #dogs #pets #adoptdontshop #Adopt

Bowman Lake Drama. Montana. One of my favorite self-challenges I do as a photographer is to look back into my archived RAW files from locations I've visited, and find photos I passed up on after that trip. I then take a new look at it using newly acquired editing knowledge, or better software, to see what I can come up with. This was a photo I didn't give a  second look at back in 2015. But after looking at it again and trying a new way of editing, I am now quite happy with it. #photography #adventure #travel #landscapephotography #dramatic #montana #bowmanlake #nature #storms #horizon #mountains

Going back into my archives, I came across this fun shoot. My friend Rocky had bought a ghillie suit for bird photography.

My New Years Eve started out a little frozen when I photographed the annual NTRD Polar Bear Jump. 13 brave (crazy?) ladies and gents jumped into the local lake. The air temp was a brisk 25f and it was windy, and I'm sure the water felt even colder. There was lots of screaming, lots of cursing...but they all made it back to shore. lol #photography #photographer

I came across this image I shot on the #x100t while down in Big Bend National Park in October. We had pulled off the road. I walked out into the Chihuahuan Desert a ways and just started shooting pics of what I saw. The vastness amazed me. It's beautiful but you wouldn't want to be lost out there. We heard stories of hikers losing the trail they were on and wondering out into what you see here. They were later found dead of dehydration. The desert is no joke. #photography #adventure #bigbendnationalpark #trails #travel

Final light.  Yesterday was the Winter Solstice. The shortest day of the year for us on the Northern Hemisphere. To me, this is a much needed check point on the journey back to the light. You see, I hate the dark dreariness of winter. So this shortest day marks the beginning of the return of just a bit of daylight each day. I think it would be different if I lived somewhere with snow, or cool winter scenery. But North Texas is just a cold, flat, brown & gray depressing place in the winter. So, bring on the longer days. Even if it's just 1-2 minutes per day, I'll take it. #soltice #winter

One of my favorite senior portraits I shot a few years back. When someone comes to me asking abiut getting senior portraits done, I really try to steer them away from the standard style shots.

It's finally hiking weather in Texas. No longer do I feel like I'm dying 1 mile down the trail from 100F+ temps! So today I hit the trail, camera in hand. It's quite the step down from the trails of Big Bend, but it was nice to hike through the woods for a couple miles and view the season change through my lens.  Because of cloudy, breezy weather I decided not to send up the drone this time. But I was happy with what I captured. #hiking #hikingadventure #outdoors #trails #walkabout #photography #adventure #dentoning #x100t

Today was the Day if the Dead Festival here in Denton. The coffin races are the main event, as teams push their homemade coffin karts down the hill.  It's a hilarious thing to see!

In 1932 someone shot Juan De Leon while he rode his horse in the area that is now Big Bend National Park. He was found several days later and buried where he fell. Some 70 years later the murder is still a mystery. We came across the grave while following the 26 mile long jeep trail known as Old Ore Road.  My buddy Duane Baker snapped this pic of me leaving a few coins to De Leon's headstone. There were quite a few coins left by others who have passed through. Figured I'd leave a little money for him to use in the afterlife. #adventure #bigbendnationalpark #travel #photography

"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life." - John Muir #balancedrock #outdoors #adventure #hikingadventure #hiking #bigbendnationalpark

The trail head to Chimney Trail. This is an easy hike in Big Bend. About 5 miles round trip.  But the views at the destination are pretty nice. Trail is level with not much elevation change. #hiking #hikingadventures #hikingadventure #photography #bigbendnationalpark

And then I stood in the Rio Grande, stared down Mexico's mighty wall and declared.... welp, I won't cross here. 😂  Thanks to @jenmramos for capturing this hilarious moment while we were on the Boquillas Canyon hike.

Taking a break after exploring the little town of Boquillas Mexico. This tiny remote village is completely off the grid. Solar power and water collection systems power this town.  Their main income is small amount of tourists who find their way out the bottom of Big Bend National Park and through the border crossing.

Taking a break in the shade under Balanced Rock. Only a 1 mile hike to this location. Final 1/4 mile is all uphill rock free-climbing. Fairly easy though, even with 30 pounds of camera gear and water.

Outside Big Bend National Park is the often forgotten Big Bend State Park Ranch. Just as rugged, although without the cloud high mountains. It's not to be missed. Amazing landscape to explore. We joked that we felt like we were searching for a lost Mars Rover.

A relaxing evening exploring Santa Elana Canyon. This cell phone pic does NOT do it justice. Massive 2000 foot high canyon walls with the Rio Grande flowing through the middle. There's a hiking trail on the US side which takes you through part of the canyon. Makes you kind of feel like Indiana Jones. #bigbendnationalpark #adventure

Big Bend National Park is beyond words. I'm only on day 2 of my time here, but I've already shot some killer photos.  The 11 hour drive to get here was worth it. Epic is the best term to describe the landscape,  I could spend a month exploring and photographing.  This is a panorama shot with my cell phone as we stopped to shoot just after sunrise. #bigbendnationalpark

No visit to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is complete without a stop by the Prairie dog village. These little guys let out squeaky barks as you get close, to alert the others. Super cute!

It's always a joy to get to photograph these majestic creatures.  We caught a lucky break and this herd was in a field near the road. #outdoors #wildlife #photography
