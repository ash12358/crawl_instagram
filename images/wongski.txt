Back in the day I used to go to a lot of instameets, where people got together for the pure joy of photography and community. It happens rarely these days, so it was fun to connect with @edwardchang, @clementwoo, and @shrey.cam for a micro-meet. Here are four portraits of Edward, who’s equally adept at shooting and modelling for photos. For the images in this set, taken at and near @thepolygongallery that’s currently featuring sublime installations by Susan Hiller, I asked him to pose in specific spots or repeatedly jump in a certain way. He did exactly that without complaint. Thanks EC for putting up with bossy Wongski. #wongskireflections

Last weekend I went to an exact spot where I shot more than two years ago, and I took new photos. While it felt very familiar, key elements - camera, angle, tones, and model - were different. I’ve also changed. I have a healthier approach to IG and renewed passion for photography. But I did ask @swongski to #strideby numerous times (which she patiently did) until I got my shot. Some things never change. #wongskireflections

When I took this photo of @swongski elegantly walking down the marble stairs in the Art Deco splendour of the Edificio Cuervo Rubio apartment building in Havana’s Vedado neighbourhood, not another soul was around. That’s my preference, to have a solitary person in the #stairwalkers role, which enables exquisite spiral staircases like this one to be the focus. 💛 #ru_alone #jj_forum_2289 #wongskistaircases #wongskisincuba

The shot you get when your mother comes over for dinner and before you drive her home, you spontaneously grab your camera, which influences you to drive later to the beach, where a man, a woman, and a duck show up at the water’s edge just as the sun is setting. Serendipity in action. #ru_water_18 🦆

Having good equipment and spending time experimenting with settings are important in dance photography, but capturing special moments can come down to one thing: luck. For two of the three photos in this set from @artsumbrelladance Company’s Season Finale, I hadn’t seen the pieces before I shot them, so I didn’t know what to expect. Pressing the shutter exactly when @dexoxter sublimely achieved rare air in these images was a lucky and happy confluence. In frame: scenes from “Apartment” by Mats Ek, “Fremd” by Wen Wei Wang, and “Unfinished Rosario” by Cayetano Soto. #wongskidance

I’ve been neglecting my staircase chasing duties, so here’s a shot from a recent return visit to the Rogers Building, which dates back to 1912. I only had a few minutes to shoot these quietly elegant stairs, but luckily a #stairwalkers #busystranger showed up right away to enhance the photo, and I was ready. #startswiths_ru #wongskistaircases

Light. That’s one of the main things I think about and adjust when capturing and editing dance photos. The goal: having the right amount of light to illuminate the dancers’ and choreographers’ artistry. Here are 5 images from @artsumbrelladance Company’s Season Finale where light is key. 1: Michael Schumacher’s “Subtext”. 2: Serge Bennathan’s “L”. 3: Sharon Eyal & Gai Behar’s “Untitled Black”. 4: Gioconda Barbuto’s “Point of Departure”. 5: Crystal Pite’s “A Picture of You Flying”. #WHPshine #jj_forum_2268 #audcseasonfinale #artsumbrelladancecompany #wongskidance

We interrupt our regularly scheduled broadcast of dance photos with a shot from a hearty lunch @ramenkoika. It shows my idea of heaven: three types of ramen (triple black garlic, seafood, and chicken karaage) and two appies (puri-puri ebi and golden scallop fry), which all hit the spot. Now if I could only figure out how to tastefully combine ramen and dance in a pic. 🤔🍜👯‍♀️ #findingwongskifood

Last night’s dress rehearsal for the @artsumbrelladance Company’s Season Finale, May 24-26, was a total pleasure to watch and photograph. Here are scenes from Wen Wei Wang’s “Fremd”, “Everything Might Topple” by @lesley.telford, Lukas Timulak’s “Between Bodies”, and Mats Ek’s “Apartment”. If you’re looking for me in the next few days I’ll be in the theatre watching all four sublime shows. #artsumbrelladancecompany #audcseasonfinale #wongskidance

Almost exactly a year ago I took these shots at the dress rehearsal for the 2017 Season Finale for @artsumbrelladance Company. I didn’t post them until now because sometimes photos need to marinate. They show dancers beautifully performing “Fremd” (which means strange in German), masterfully choreographed by Wen Wei Wang. The enthralling piece will be remounted in the 2018 Season Finale, May 24-26. I can’t wait to see the creativity and beauty that @artsumbrella dancers always bring to the stage. #ru_blacknwhite_18 #artsumbrelladancecompany #audcseasonfinale #wongskidance

Process: I completely desaturated this photo and then brought all the colour back except on @swongski and the sidewalk. Then I lowered the saturation again to soften the tones. Meaning: The reverse colour splash is a metaphor for being in that exciting and sometimes scary transition to becoming an adult. I know Sarah will meet the challenges as she makes that transition and leaves home to pursue her passion for dance. 💜 #lifewiththewongskis

Sorry (not sorry) for spamming your feeds with dance photos the last few days, but here’s another set of shots from Program 3, which @balletbc will perform one more time tonight. The first two pics are from “Bill” by Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar. The last two are from “when you left” by Emily Molnar. I enjoyed seeing the beautiful show a second time last night, and yes, I’m thoroughly obsessed with contemporary dance that’s conceived and performed this creatively.

I first saw @balletbc perform “Beginning After” - choreographed by Cayetano Soto - in 2016, and it was entrancing. Ballet BC is remounting the piece in Program 3, which continues until May 12, and it looks even bolder in its visual palette and movement language. Here are shots from the exquisite “Beginning After” - please swipe left to see all five of them. #balletbc #wongskidance

There are so many highlights in Program 3, the remarkable @balletbc show opening tonight and continuing until May 12. This is one: the kinetic movement by @brandonalley94 and the company’s dancers in the mesmerizing “Bill”, choreographed by Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar. Huge thanks to Ballet BC for inviting us dance photography nerds to shoot today’s dress rehearsal. Stay tuned for more shots. #balletbc #wongskidance

When I watch and photograph riveting contemporary dance, my focus is all over the stage, following and capturing dancers in the moment. But I also marvel at the intention behind the moments: how choreographers convey their vision, and how dancers stay true to that vision while expressing themselves. These thoughts swirled in my head last week at an inspiring event @thedancecentrebc: the @artsumbrelladance Choreographic Showcase featuring 5 wonderful works choreographed by @artsumbrella dancers, who were generously mentored by @crystal_pite. Big congrats to the choreographers and dancers, and happy International Dance Day!

My research revealed there’s a unique staircase at the College of Architects in Havana. So I had to see it. To get there, we went on on a long walk in searing heat from Old Havana to the Vedado neighbourhood. It was well worth the trek to photograph this elegant structure and the #stairwalkers. And yes, this is the first time a brown leather couch has made a cameo in one of my stairs shots. 😉 #wongskistaircases #wongskisincuba

Last weekend was all about dance. On Saturday I drove @swongski and three other dancers in pouring rain to Seattle, where we saw @pacificnorthwestballet superbly perform “Emergence” by @crystal_pite. The next day, I was part of a group of photographers capturing the @artsumbrelladance Company and Performance Research Program. As a dance dad, I see the challenges they go through - injuries, self-doubt, finding their artistic voice - and then I get to see them perform with intense and beautiful focus, like they did Sunday. Pictured here are scenes from pieces by Crystal Pite, James Kudelka, and @lesley.telford. I can’t wait to see them do these and other pieces April 26 at The Dance Centre and May 24-26 at Season Finale. Please swipe left to see more shots. #wongskidance

Meet @iamjohnyoo. I met him at instameets back in the day, and he has brought a lot of great photography/videography and infectious spirit to meets. John did that again last week when @vanartgallery kindly convened a great group of IGers to see the mind-blowing @takashipom exhibit, which continues until May 6. He’s silhouetting in front of “Isle of the Dead”, a fascinating piece that Murakami created after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. #VAGxMURAKAMI #ru_silhouette_18

There are so many colours, shapes, characters, and ideas at play in the remarkable artwork of @takashipom on display @vanartgallery as part of The Octopus Eat Its Own Leg. So it was great for a group of us IGers to see the sublime exhibit, which continues until May 6 (with extended hours on Fridays until 9 pm), and receive an insightful tour from @byjessa. Huge thanks to the VAG for a superb event, and @notch8restaurant for the tasty post-event gathering. And thanks to @glenny.gs for striding by perfectly. #VAGxMURAKAMI #wongskireflections

More than 3 months ago I posted a version of this shot that I totally desaturated except for the pop of colour on the #stairwalkers dude. I said at the time that I might post the full-colour version, showing the snakeskin print on the stairs that was part of @thehaasbrothers collab with @barneysny, and here it finally is. It’s interesting how it can take awhile to be comfortable with the look of a shot. Or maybe I overthink things. 🤔 Have a good week. #wongskistaircases

What’s #onthetable @theriseeatery: delicious dishes from the new spring tasting menu, including Confit of Interest (five spice duck confit), 3C Drummies (sweet basil and shao hsing wine marinated chicken drummettes), Diamonds & Pearls (corn & tapioca fritters), and Torched Sterling (flat iron beef tataki).

I’ve had a lot of ramen in my time, but never Bacon ’N Egg Ramen like what I enjoyed yesterday at @gyozabarvan.

Today I was lucky to be able to photograph the dress rehearsal for Romeo + Juliet by @balletbc and choreographer @medhiwalerski. It was an intense and incredible experience. Here’s a scene with @emchessa as Juliet and other dancers in the company (including some from @artsumbrelladance) that shows how they stayed true to the classic tragedy while also incorporating a contemporary aesthetic. If you’re in Vancouver, do what you can to see R + J, running Feb. 21-24. It’s a great work of art. #bbcromeoandjuliet #balletbc #romeoandjuliet #wongskidance

Things I wonder about: When architect Augustus Warren Gould designed the Rogers Building, which was completed in 1912, did he imagine the mesmerizing view when looking up at the ornate staircase going 10 storeys high? I think about such things when encountering architectural gems like this. Thanks @bychrischeung for introducing me to this local treasure. #wongskistaircases

One week from tonight @balletbc will perform the world premiere of Medhi Walerski’s full-length reworking of Romeo + Juliet. @brandonalley94 and @emchessa will dance the roles of the star-crossed lovers. Here are two shots I took of them in “Beginning After” by Cayetano Soto. (Swipe left to see the second shot.) I can’t wait to see Ballet BC’s contemporary take on R + J, Feb. 21-24.

This is a long weekend where I live because Monday is a holiday: Family Day. My family will celebrate the day by going thrifting together. I’m also celebrating someone who I consider to be family: @glenny.gs. We connected in IG ages ago, long before we had things like the algorithm to worry about. Through a shared passion for taking photos, exploring the restaurant scene (Glenny’s shots of food and interiors rock), and analyzing life’s absurdities, we became close friends. I love it when people embrace change, so huge congrats to “G” for landing a great new job. 💛💙💖 #friendsinmyfeed • She’s doing a #strideby in front of a wonderful mural by @aj_____b & @timbarnardart. #wongskimurals

Real talk: many of my dance shots don’t turn out. They’re often out of focus or too dark or both. But I keep working on dance photography because I’m passionate about contemporary dance and learning how to capture it. Plus I do a happy dance when the key elements - light and movement - come together in a photographic moment. Here’s an image of two wonderful dancers - @alexisstarfletcher and @mocookiesmomilk - from the time @balletbc performed “I and I am You”. I’m really looking forward to see how Ballet BC interprets “Romeo and Juliet”, Feb. 21-24. I can’t wait to photograph that. #two_ru_18 #wongskidance

Most of my recent stair posts have been from travels, so it was fun last week to chase staircases locally with two fellow @stairwalkers mods: @akaalec and @andyinstamatic. I had previously shot a beautiful marble staircase in the venerable Vancouver Block, and then I found out about this second set of cool stairs in the same 105-year-old building. Thanks @rellowyar for the tip.

Two months ago I posted a photo from this spot of the NYC skyline and these wood pilings. Here’s a shot I got from the same spot in Brooklyn after pivoting slightly to the west to capture the sunset and a tiny Statue of Liberty in the horizon. Happy Huesday folks. #ru_sky_18

Windows three ways … After having a wonderful meal @crowbareastvan as part of @dineoutvanfest, and enjoying the cool vibe of the neighbourhood restaurant and cocktail bar, I returned yesterday to do a shoot with the theme of windows. The theme connects to IG’s weekend hashtag project, #WHPwindows. The photos are also an homage to @fatiography, a visual storyteller I greatly admire. Big thanks to @eeeelysse - a beloved member of our family - for being in the shoot. She’s holding Crowbar’s beautiful “Vivian Ward” cocktail. Swipe left to see the trio of @windowportraits.

Two months ago when I looked up underneath the spiral staircase @barneysny I was pleasantly surprised to see such a pure, almost spiritual aesthetic in a luxurious temple of commerce. That look stayed with me, so here it is for y’all. #wongskistaircases

What you see #onthetable @1886vancouver in @parqvancouverbc - Tropical Fruit Soup: mango, strawberries, banana, passionfruit, grapefruit, sago, and coconut ice cream. This is a sublimely refreshing dessert that’s part of 1886’s delicious three-course @dineoutvanfest dinner menu that I enjoyed in advance of the Dine Out festival that runs Jan. 19-Feb. 4. What you don’t see: me in the elegant Chinese fine dining restaurant frantically trying to get the shot I wanted before the ice cream started melting. Made it just in time. #findingwongskifood #dovf

Early in the morning on New Year’s Day, I went by myself to a familiar and beloved place: @granville_island. As the public market and shops were closed, not many people were there. So I just walked around the entire island, which was enveloped in fog, and casually took photos along the way. Going on a solo photowalk was a great way to reflect and reset. I hope your 2018 is starting well. #wongskireflections #granvilleisland

Meet Christopher Cheung. He’s a Vancouver journalist who writes about “people, places, and patterns” in the city. I admire Chris because he’s a dogged reporter and thought-provoking writer. I’m not just saying that because he wrote a positive piece about my photography, writing, and Instagraming in @vancouriernews. In the last two months @bychrischeung has written no less than four articles about different aspects of IG life in Vancouver. His latest feature came out this week in the Tyee - there’s a link in my profile - and it’s a fascinating, sociological look at IGers who pose for each other on a hip rooftop parking lot. He’s also been photographing the photographers in this urban playground and posting the shots @lotspotting. Thanks Chris for being the only local journalist I know of who’s seriously examining #thisinstagramlife, and for striding by this fantastic mural that @druvid and @persondoingstuff did as part of @vanmuralfest. #wongskimurals

Here’s one last staircase shot for 2017, of a classic spiral in a historic NYC hotel. The hotel opened in 1900, and an 18-story marble spiral staircase was added in 1910. It went from offering luxury accommodations to being a grim welfare hotel before its Beaux-Arts elegance was restored. I enjoyed taking photos of the 107-year-old staircase and imagining the disparate lives of those who have walked on it. On another note, I’m continuing to add tracks to my “Sounds of 2017” @spotify playlist, so if you feel inclined check out the link in my profile. All the best for 2018! #wongskistaircases #old_ru

High on my bucket list for NYC was the Oculus that soars above the World Trade Centre Transportation Hub. The Oculus was criticized for its cost and construction delays, but I had to see the striking architecture by Santiago Calatrava, and it didn’t disappoint. Challenges: shooting it as symmetrically as possible, and without too many people on the marble floor. Solutions: taking a million photos - one was bound to work - and turning to my friend Photoshop to remove a few extraneous people.

As I looked up at the “Sky Reflector-Net” that’s the centrepiece of this massive and beautiful work of #art_chitecture_, I thought about the metaphors it conveys. The prismatic glass blades in the skylight that disperse light rays in this transit hub look like birds in flight. For the purposes of this post, however, they represent songs. With that in mind, I put together a diverse playlist with tracks released in 2017 that I’ve enjoyed listening to in @spotify. Click the link in my profile if you would like to check out the music. Happy holidays!

Ever wonder how a dish came to be at a favourite restaurant? I asked @anhandchi about a brand new item on their autumn/winter dinner menu, Chả Cá Thăng Long (turmeric and dill cod), and this is what I learned: In 2013, @thuymeetsworld - co-owner of the restaurant with her brother Vincent - visited Vietnam with their mom Ly and grandma Tao. The three generations of women dined at a place in Hanoi’s old quarter with the same name as the fish dish. They were struck by the comforting warmth and taste of the signature dish. Back in Vancouver, chef Ly tested and re-tested the recipe for the dish until it was ready to be served at the beautiful Anh and Chi, which opened in 2016. So this tender and flavourful fish - marinated and seared in the kitchen, cooked further right on your table, and combined with toasted sesame cracker, peanuts, shrimp sauce and paste, and vermicelli - reflects close family ties, nostalgic memories of home, and a passion for lovingly prepared comfort food. Thanks to Anh and Chi for the great culinary and cultural experience, and to @yvreats for enjoying the dish with me. Also pictured: Gỏi Xoài (mango salad with prawn). #findingwongskifood

One of my stair goals in NYC was to photograph the white staircase @barneysny. For months I had been dreaming about shooting this exquisite spiral because of its clean, monochromatic style. Then we showed up and discovered a bright orange and yellow pattern had been placed on the steps as part of a collaboration with the Haas brothers. It’s a fun look, which I might share later, but I was determined to get the image I envisioned. So I desaturated the photo and did a colour splash on the #stairwalkers dude, who was conveniently wearing a red shirt. Fun times. #wongskistaircases #quietstranger

Is it a strange desire to want to capture four towers in one #lookingup_architecture / #minimal_lookup shot? That was a goal before going to NYC - mission accomplished. FYI: @davidwelsh is great at this type of shot and any archi capture. Check out his beautiful gallery. #xmarksthespot

While on a walk in Brooklyn we stumbled upon this spot that I had seen in IG but wasn’t specifically looking for. It’s the perfect place to capture both the Manhattan skyline and sunset. But I couldn’t stay because we had a music show to catch. So I plotted to return, which I did on our last day in NYC. It was a beautiful late afternoon/early evening that attracted about 10 photographers, all with cameras perched on tripods pointing toward the wood pilings and big city. I joined in, tripod-less, but happy to be capturing the glorious scene. #ru_contrasting

Meet @ladykty. I connected with Ketty in IG more than two years ago, and I’m a big fan of her gallery, which includes great shots by her and of her. The camera loves Ketty, and she’s also passionate about being behind the lens, as I saw when I hung out with her in NYC. More things I learned: she’s patient, detail-oriented, and fearless about doing what it takes to get the shot. Plus she’s irrepressibly fun. Thanks Ketty for the awesome New York morning.

Martians looking down at us as we set up this photo in a cool red staircase @universityofbc might have thought we were strange. I was yelling instructions and my pals were manoeuvring themselves into position, ultimately with arms extended. This is how we roll when we shoot together and have carefree fun. Thanks to @edwardchang, @glenny.gs, @camcaptures_, and @yvr.alana for putting up with my insistent art direction, and being such great #stairwalkers and friends. 👽❤️ #wongskistaircases

Meet “Tegy Spaghetti”: Squid ink pasta, sea urchin cream, egg yolk, and nori. This was part of a glorious solo meal I had @theriseeatery today.

Everytime @balletbc and @instameetvancouver announce an instameet at a dress rehearsal for the dance company, I sign up in about a minute. That’s how excited I am about getting the chance to see and shoot the great dancers and meet fellow dance photags. Today’s performance was sublime. Here are two shots of the stellar @alexisstarfletcher in Johan Inger’s whimsically riveting B.R.I.S.A. from Program 1 that’s on Nov. 2-4. If you can, definitely see this kinetic show. #balletbc #wongskidance

Throwing it back to a fun night in London when my awesome friend @sabear took me to this iconic spot. I have no idea who the woman in the shot is, but she was posing for photos so I had to take some. * Two people I hugely appreciate for their creativity, community spirit, and friendship - @salopalo and @bluemoodz - have launched @incredible_bnw.

A shot of @what_fran_saw taking a shot, while the #stairwalkers dude/#busystranger does his thing … I’ve been trying to share a stairs shot every fourth post, because I’m obsessed with staircases and that frequency creates a diagonal pattern in my grid that amuses me. So I was slightly alarmed to learn that IG may change the grid from three photos across each row to four. That will screw up the aesthetic of carefully curated grids. But all will not be lost - instead of a diagonal I’ll have a straight line of #wongskistaircases running down my gallery. I can sleep at night if that happens. 😉😴

My mission that morning was to stand at the intersection of Cuba and Empedrado, two narrow streets in Old Havana, and capture what I saw. That’s when I spotted this woman who seemed to be barely moving, almost frozen in time, like many aspects of Cuba itself. It was only after examining the shot that I saw the man across the street. #wongskisincuba

One of Vancouver’s gems is @beaucoupbakery. Beaucoup’s light and flaky croissants and other French-inspired pastries are heavenly. It’s a narrow space that gets crowded, but that’s part of its charm; the bustling ambience speaks to the quality and soul of the baking. Then there’s the great story behind Beaucoup, which was founded in 2012 by @jackiekaiellis, who closed her design company to pursue pastry. This year she sold the flourishing bakery and café to @6etty and @jac9y - sister (also a former designer) and brother and longtime Beaucoup employees. It was a pleasure to be there yesterday with good friends, supporting a family-run business and enjoying the art of pastry. #beaucoupbakery #findingwongskifood 🥐

The story behind the image: I took this shot on a beautiful sunny day, which resulted in a bright shot. Too bright. So I toned it down by going bnw. I also wanted to keep the subtle pop of colour from the clothes worn by the tiny person at the water’s edge. So I did my first ever colour splash. Fun times. If you’re interested in learning the few steps I followed in Photoshop, ask in a comment, and I will reveal all. 🖤💗#reflecting_ru #wongskireflections

After spotting this in an article headlined “25 sexy London staircases you need to see”, I had to go here. The only problem: a hotel employee wouldn’t let me go up the grand staircase to get a looking down capture. After some convincing, he let me take a few shots like this one, which turned out to be a symmetrical blessing in disguise. Fun fact: In 1996, the Spice Girls did a dance routine right on these stairs for their “Wannabe” video. 💃🏻 #wongskistaircases

The yellow drew me in to this striking installation, titled “1995 1999 2015 2016 2017”, by Jeanie Riddle. Those are the years in which @jeaniemontreal created the folded paintings you see in a neat pile. The installation is part of the engaging new exhibition @vanartgallery - “Entangled: Two Views on Contemporary Canadian Painting” - that opened today. Thanks to VAG for the preview, and @kiramclean for moodily posing next to this #yellowoclock work of art. 💛

I was excited to see this sublime public street art that’s part of the 2017 @vanmuralfest. I love what @tavukciyan painted in the mural, titled “Abstraction”. This also resonates with me because one of the basement jazz clubs I’m writing about in my book existed just steps from here in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Three years ago, @rizealliance let me go down rickety stairs to see the original space that housed the Cellar jazz club before it was demolished to make way for their huge condo development. That was an interesting experience - I could sense the jazz ghosts. This year Rize and the Mural Fest sponsored a competition, which led to this mural being created. I had to take a shot of @mileswong - a fine jazz drummer who appreciates abstract expression - striding by. 🚶🏻 #vanmuralfest #wongskimurals

Six weeks ago I posted the looking down version of this extraordinary staircase. Here's the looking up view, which enthralled me when I saw it because of the pure curves, clean intersecting lines, and cool tones. I’m running out of European staircase shots to post. Time to find more cool stairs to photograph in Vancouver. Who wants to join me on that mission? #wongskistaircases

The goofy technique I used to get this shot: I held the index finger on my left hand in front of the little green house; I focused on the finger; I moved my finger out of the shot, which momentarily brought the house into focus and made the fence blurry; and I quickly pressed the shutter with the index finger on my right hand. I repeated this about 10 times before I got what I wanted. My idea of fun. ☝🏻💚💙 #curiocityvan #dailyhivevan #wongskireflections

Five things I know about @edwardchang: • He’s a camera and photography nerd. I admire his dedication to shooting with digital and film, and the terrific results he achieves with both. Plus he has sexy cameras. • Edward is an excellent writer, as his blog posts and IG captions/comments confirm. • He’s smart. Get him talking about “big data” and you’ll learn a lot. • Edward is a bubble tea aficionado who’s the man to consult if you want to know where the best Asian beverage joints are. • He’s a great friend who I’m super happy to have met through this community. #wongskimurals

In my last caption I talked about how spontaneity took me to London. It also took me to the west coast of Sweden where I met the wonderful family behind @absinthemindedmagazine for the first time.

I've gone three posts without sharing a spiral shot so clearly it’s time. That’s my niece @livbarath at the bottom of the exquisite Tulip Stairs. Liv is a sublime singer, and I made an atypical spontaneous decision to go to London in June to surprise my niece and be at her graduation recital @lccmlondon. It was a very good decision because there’s no substitute for being there, and she sang beautifully. Here’s to more spontaneity, surprises, soulful music, and heart-stopping staircases. 🌀 #wongskistaircases #stairwalkers

Things are looking up with the book about Vancouver jazz history that I’ve been working on for more than four years. After completing the research but struggling with being able to focus on writing it, I’ve drafted a number of chapters in the last few months and feel I’m on the right track. At times I’ve blamed IG for distracting me from the book, but I’ve learned that most distractions come from within. I also have IG to thank for connecting me to @missyjena, who’s helped me so much in coming up with strategies to get past obstacles to finishing the book. She also thought of the idea that I could share more about the book in IG, and I will be doing that. So heartfelt thanks to Jena, and to all of you for your support whenever I’ve mentioned the jazzy book. 🎶 💙 #blueskies #lookingup_architecture #skyscraping_architecture #minimal_lookup #linemeetscorner #shotoniphone

Despite the fact that a wee amount of blood was shed not long after fearless @amandalcam nailed this #jumpstagram, a great time was had with Amanda, @camcaptures_, and @megwhitee as we admired this year’s @vanmuralfest creations - including this epic work by @andy.dxn - and hit up stellar craft beer joints in the hood. ❤️🍺 #vanmuralfest #whpadventure #wongskimurals

Golden Bao Fritter, with yuzu marmalade, condensed milk, and French vanilla ice cream anyone? This dessert, influenced by Taiwanese street food, was the sweet culmination of a superb meal I had @gyozabarvan last week with @dorringtonr and @glenny.gs. Many thanks to chef @woojin_coat and the team for the delicious summer menu dishes. And thanks to Dorri for holding the dipping dessert so expertly - I’ve always wanted to take a food shot like this. #findingwongskifood

Just to clarify, this isn’t a staircase. The stairs are on one side of the building, and the scary doorless elevators that move in a continuous loop are on the other. It’s simply an exquisite set of spirals that I had the pleasure of viewing and shooting as part of a memorable 28 hours in Copenhagen.

Here’s a #lookingup_architecture / #minimal_lookup shot, bnw style for y’all, from an unassuming London inn. I thought about showing you the looking down view of this spiral but the carpet is very purple, and trust me, you don’t want to see that. 💜🙈🖤☺️ #wongskistaircases #spiralstairsaware

The shot you get after you make a reservation for dinner with your dear wife at a restaurant that just happens to be a few blocks from a beach that offers prime viewing of #goldenhour. 😉 By the way, the meal we had @cacaovancouver was outstanding. And can you spot the errant frisbee?

The mission: shoot a cool staircase in Copenhagen. The research: I found a few pics of this beauty in IG, including one geotagged Kontrapunkt. Gaining entry: The door was locked, so I buzzed Kontrapunkt, which is a design agency. A woman answered and I explained that I was there to take photos of the staircase. After a slight pause, she let me in, no questions asked. The shoot: I took my time shooting from various angles that revealed different perspectives on the clean curves, soothing tones, and luminous light. I didn’t see a soul the whole time. Bliss. #wongskistaircases

Layer 3: Queen’s House, England’s first building designed in the classical style, and home of the exquisite Tulip spiral staircase. Layer 4: #tinypeopleinbigplaces having a carefree day in Greenwich Park. Layer 5 (not pictured): Me obsessing over how to align the shot just so. The End.

Challenges with getting this shot: To see this view it was necessary to go in the “Members Room”. I also had to wait a long time until only a few #stairwalkers were in the right place. Plus the only way to get the image I had in mind was to extend my arm holding the camera as far as possible over the railing. While it didn’t work with my DSLR, I got slightly more extension with my phone, even without a selfie stick. 😉 So here’s an iPhone shot of this exquisite spiral staircase and rotunda for y’all. #wongskistaircases

You know I adore aesthetically pleasing staircases. I also love tasty, comforting, and simple food, and that's what I enjoyed last night @dosankorestaurant, which serves yōshoku - homestyle Japanese cuisine. Among the many highlights: tempra (seasonal vegetable tempura), tonkatsu (panko crusted pork), and coffee jelly parfait. Beers from @saltspringislandales also hit the spot. And the new family-owned and operated restaurant in Japantown has a great aesthetic with its exposed brick walls and cool lighting. I will be back soon! #findingwongskifood

Friendship is … When you see a cool photo on your friend’s phone and she gives you detailed instructions on where to get the shot, and even where to stand between two specific buildings. Thanks for the tips @what_fran_saw. Also dedicating this to @swongski - enjoy London and the adventures ahead.

Meet the exquisite Tulip Stairs, seen here from the bottom, at ornate Queen’s House in Greenwich. This is definitely the oldest spiral staircase I’ve shot - construction of the house was completed in 1635. It's also said to be haunted. In 1966 a reverend from White Rock, BC took a photo on the stairs that showed a shrouded figure ascending the stairs in pursuit of another figure. The reverend said the staircase was clear when he took the photo, which became well-known. Spooky! 🌀👻 #wongskistaircases

IG has taken me to remarkable places, and last week it took me to the beautiful west coast of Sweden. That’s where I visited with the amazing family that’s behind @absinthemindedmagazine. Thanks to their warm hospitality, I had a great time eating delicious food, seeing the gorgeous coastline, and talking about our hopes and dreams. Their passion is publishing Absintheminded Magazine, a travel and style publication that uniquely encapsulates slow living in exquisite images and eloquently worded stories. It’s been an honour for me to contribute two articles about music for the magazine, which they’ve produced in five online volumes. This is a shot of the “Cold bath house” at the end of a 60-metre pier, where we dipped into the frigid Kattegat sea, sat in a very hot but soothing sauna, and relaxed in a gently heated Japanese pool. Slow living at its best.

What you see: The looking up view of one of the most spectacular spirals I've seen. What you don't see: The two elevators nearby that are constantly in motion and are wide open without doors, requiring people to enter and exit them very carefully. 😱

It’s rare when all the elements come together in a dining experience, including top-notch service, a beautiful design sensibility in the room, great company, and of course sublime food and drink. That’s what happened last night at the Botanist. Appetizers pictured #onthetable: root vegetables, pan-seared scallops, hand-cut tagliatelle, Nova Scotia lobster tail, and charred octopus.

Today was a grey and wet day in Raincouver so I'm thinking back to a sunny afternoon with friends, including @jackymchui, who executed a perfect strideby in front of the whimsical mural by @shannonelliott_y2k. 🚶🏻#unbirthdaymeet #wongskimurals

It's hard to convey through a photo and caption why I'm so passionate about @artsumbrelladance company. But I can tell you this: during last night's first show of the company's three-night Season Finale, I kept feeling breathless because I was so captivated and moved by what I was watching and hearing. Here's a shot from an incredible piece that opened the show, "Fremd", choreographed by Wen Wei Wang. #wongskidance

I was thrilled to be able to photograph last night's dress rehearsal for @artsumbrelladance company's Season Finale, which begins tonight and continues until Saturday. I was enthralled by the visionary choreography, transcendent dancing, and inspired costumes and lighting. Here's a shot of the opening scene from "Beloved Beast", choreographed by Fernando Hernando Magadan. If you need me over the next few days just look for me at the theatre - I'll be attending all four shows. That's how profound the performances will be. #wongskidance

After an epic Cambodian-Vietnamese lunch, in typical IGer fashion we went into an alley for a group shot. Lacking a tripod, we couldn’t include the photographer in the photo. Then @edwardchang spotted an abandoned mini-fridge sitting in the alley. He suggested perching his camera on the fridge and remotely triggering the shutter with an app on his phone. Kudos to Edward for the shot, which worked brilliantly. Who’s in the shot: Except for one longtime pal, I became friends with everyone through Instagram. Thanks for the fun times, good eats, and supportive friendship. 📷: @edwardchang and the fridge. Edit: @wongski. #thisinstagramlife #unbirthdaymeet

I’ve always wanted to #putaplaneonit, so I did … Process: On Toronto’s Adelaide St., I took a #lookingup_architecture shot at an intersection. A few minutes later I was walking several blocks away on the same street when I suddenly saw a plane in the sky. I took a quick pic. Days later, I used the magnetic lasso tool in Photoshop to close crop the plane, I darkened and enlarged the plane, and I moved it to the intersection shot. Why I did it: Because I enjoyed the editing challenge and it’s a way to keep having fun in IG. ✈️

My original plan for this shot was to post it as a #sundaycarpic, with a caption that forgave my family for photobombing my carefully lined up car capture. Then I realized it's a rare IG image showing my dear wife, so on that note, happy Mother's Day to my wonderful partner in life and to all the moms.

Elevation ... It’s rare when you see one piece that fully conveys the exuberance and beauty of dance and music. That’s what “Minus 16”, choreographed by Ohad Naharin, achieves. I saw @balletbc give a riveting performance of the masterwork at their dress rehearsal for Program 3, and I’m excited to see it again tonight. #balletbc #wongskidance

I once again had the privilege of taking photos at a @balletbc dress rehearsal, and the contemporary dance was as breathtaking as ever. Here’s a shot from the company’s performance of "LOCK" by Israeli choreographer Emanuel Gat. I was so struck by the interplay between the large ensemble of dancers in this piece. It’s part of Program 3, which opened last night and continues to Saturday. The program also includes the dynamic "Keep Driving, I'm Dreaming" by Emily Molnar and “Minus 16”, a must-see classic by another Israeli choreographer, Ohad Naharin. Many thanks to Ballet BC and @instameetvancouver for hosting us photags. #wongskidance

Yesterday I finally saw the @equinoxgallery exhibit featuring the amazing and pioneering colour photos of @fredherzogphotography. As I was marvelling at his candid, mid-century street photography, I started thinking about how a lot of my shots with people involve them being posed or striding by in a prescribed way. New personal goal: more candid photography, starting with this one, where I didn’t tell the busy stranger or the bird what to do. 😉 The exhibit ends May 6. If you’re in Vancouver, do whatever you can to see it. #wongskireflections

The shot you get when your awesome friend agrees to provide some contrast in the distance by patiently posing - with her pink hair … I really need to learn how to get the image I want the first time I shoot at a location. I finally got it on my fourth visit here. Thanks to @jacquelinechui, and all of the others who posed, for tolerating my OCD tendencies as I slowly figured out how to incorporate the necessary elements in a symmetrical shot. 💗

The shot: Looking down from the top of the one-of-a-kind spiral staircase @agotoronto. The story behind the shot: A month ago I featured on @stairwalkers an almost identical image that @nicola.j.photography took here. I was so inspired by Nicola’s sublime capture that I wanted to replicate it. But when I got to the top I couldn’t see a way to shoot down until I raised my camera over the opening and took blind shots. The IG Gods were smiling on me that day by putting a stairwalker - my friend's friend - in the right place at the right time. Serendipity is a great thing. #stairwalkers #wongskistaircases

The shot you get after crouching down low behind a puddle and waiting patiently for busy strangers to stride by at the right spot ... Happy Easter. 🙏 #wongskireflections

For once I'm speechless when writing a caption. That's how awestruck I am by the beautiful spiral staircase @agotoronto designed by @frankgehry. Feeling blessed that I was able to shoot it yesterday. #wongskistaircases

The shot you get when awesome friends patiently put up with your bossy instructions on where to stand and how to look up. @yvr.alana ignored the instructions for this shot, and the happy result was a #caughtgramming twist on a #stairwalkers shot. Creds to @snappingpixels for posting a pic of the red staircase that inspired me to shoot it. ❤️ #wongskistaircases #thisinstagramlife

Reflections on Dance Choreography in BnW … Last night I went to a showcase of pieces by seven young choreographers, who are all members of @artsumbrelladance company, and I was blown away by the creative quality of their work. The company performed the works beautifully, and it was insightful to hear each choreographer - and their amazing mentor Crystal Pite - talk about the choreographic process. This is a shot of “Pretty Girls”, an impactful commentary on gender and sexuality norms, choreographed by @wknd.l0sr. Congrats to all of the choreographers and dancers, and kudos to @artsumbrella for supporting this project. #WHPhowicreate #wongskidance #wongskireflections

Meet @bluechameleon. I admire Sharon because she’s passionate about photography (and music). Regardless of how grey or wet it is, she’s out there capturing stellar shots. It’s appropriate that you can’t see her face here because Sharon excels in stealth busy stranger captures, and I wouldn’t want to blow her cover. 😉 Many thanks to the inspirational @akaalec for bringing us and our umbrellas together yesterday - along with the amazing @bon.bahar and irrepressible @andyinstamatic - and for envisioning this image. ☂️ #wongskireflections

As soon as we went over the bridge at the entrance to Las Terrazas, I knew I had arrived at my happy place. I could see amazing lake reflections on either side of the bridge. I took a “few” photos of those reflections before we explored the pastoral eco-village that’s a UNESCO biosphere reserve and ate at El Romero, one of Cuba’s best vegetarian restaurants. #🇨🇺 #wongskisincuba #wongskireflections

Some people like gazing at sunsets or sunrises. I'm content to look up underneath staircases and contemplate the beautiful design, in this case, marrying wood and steel. Try it sometime - it's great #neckxercise. 🙄#wongskistaircases

Last night I went back to see @balletbc perform Program 2, and it was just as profoundly beautiful as the first time. I won't be able to see the final show tonight, but here's a shot of an uplifting moment in Anthem, choreographed by @company605. This gives a glimpse of the piece's kinetic power. #balletbc #instameetvancouver #wongskidance

You may have noticed I’ve become obsessed with dance, and watching yesterday’s @balletbc dress rehearsal for Program 2 confirmed why. I love the combination of technique, athleticism, creativity, metaphorical storytelling, and beauty in contemporary dance, and all are powerfully on display in Program 2. In the photos is Andrew Bartee, who performs beautifully in Wen Wei Wang’s Swan. I strongly encourage Vancouverites to attend the show, which runs until March 18. To celebrate Canada’s 150th anniversary, the program features works by world-class choreographers all based in our city. Many thanks to Ballet BC and @instameetvancouver for organizing the meet.

Meet @ballerina_hj. She's a member of Vancouver’s @artsumbrelladance company (AUDC). What’s special about AUDC is that top choreographers in North America and Europe create cutting edge pieces for the pre-professional company, because of its international reputation, and the young dancers like Hannah-Jane perform them with total dedication to the art of contemporary dance. Speaking of dedication, thanks so much HJ for jumping numerous times in the early morning rain so I could get the shot. And thanks to @swongski for setting up the shoot. In June, the company will travel to the Netherlands to perform at three prestigious festivals, and the dancers are raising funds to make the tour a reality. Today they will put on a dance-a-thon fundraiser @artsumbrella, and in my DJ Wongski alter ego, I will digitally spin tunes for the dancers. #👯 #wongskidance

While most of our Cuban trip was in Havana, we did an overnighter to Viñales, a charming town two and a half hours west of the capital where most of the houses look like these: colourful, one-storey, with a porch at the front, and a flat roof. I took this accidental strideby from the roof of the casa particulares where we stayed. The family who owns our casa was very welcoming, and we had some amazing meals there. Our experience in the town and nearby Viñales Valley, where we rode horses, offered a relaxing respite from the cacophony of sounds and sights in Havana. 🇨🇺 #wongskisincuba

One minute after I met @yvr.alana for the very first time, we snuck into an amazing spiral staircase. That day, almost exactly two years ago, set the tone for our friendship. Since then, I’ve shot with Alana - more than anybody - on a number of cool staircases. And there’s usually tasty lunch or coffee involved as she has an alter ego: @yvreats. Thanks sis for the fun times, and for forgiving me when I got us in situations where we were yelled at. This portrait was taken @vanartgallery, but stay tuned for shots from our never-ending staircase adventures.

If it rains this weekend, remember that the logical thing to do is grab 2 close pals with umbrellas and make them do bidirectional stridebys at the beach until you get your shot. Have a great weekend! #yellowoclock #umbrellaplanet #🌂#whpcolorful

I'm a creature of habit when it comes to ramen. Nine times out of 10 I'll have classic Shio ramen, but I did something different last night with good friends and had this Peko ramen, which is made with tonkotsu broth, milk, shio-dare, and brandy. I'm glad we tried it because it's light and flavourful and hits the comfort food spot. If you feel so inclined, it's available at @benkeiramen until March 31. Now is it too soon to plan the next ramen safari? #🍜 #findingwongskifood

True love is ... When your amazing wife agrees to go on a one-hour tour of the greenest commercial building in the world while visiting Seattle because she knows that's the only way her stairs-obsessed hubbie can shoot its beautiful wood and steel staircase, and then she patiently helps make it a #stairwalkers shot.

As you may have guessed I'm not the biggest snow fan. That was confirmed this morning when I heard the recycling truck coming and I stupidly ran out with the recycling - while wearing flip-flops. 😱 Despite almost doing a face-plant, I'm giving in and posting this one-time-only snow shot. Thanks to the #busystranger runner for showing up at the right time. #❄️ #snowsucks

What to do on a snowy Saturday? Looking forward to meeting @glenny.gs here for donuts, warm drinks, and conversation about Paris. 🇫🇷 And thinking back to another sweet donut sesh and chat about Macs at the same place with @yvr.alana . 🖥 This is how we cope when snowmageddon hits Vancouver. ❄️ Donuts on the table: Strawberries and cream, Apple bacon fritter, and mango bismarck. #🍩 #findingwongskifood

Some very cool things are happening @fairmontpacific as part of #japanunlayered, Jan. 27-Feb. 28. The much-anticipated @mujicanada and @beams_official pop-up stores are there. Plus there's a retrospective exhibit on the visionary architecture of #kengokuma. I went to a preview of all of this, and everything is beautifully presented. So why am I posting a shot of @silkenchu, who kindly agreed to pose? Because she was part of the preview, and the wild polyester dress Silken was wearing is a great metaphor for the concept of layering that's an important part of Japanese architecture, fashion, art, and design. Plus I can't resist a chance to take a portrait of a beautiful subject. Thanks to the Fairmont Pacific Rim and @westbankcorp for the sneak peek.

I had a great time shooting for the pure joy of it the other day. Thanks to @debuguru for meeting up, pointing out a good vantage point for capturing this intriguing staircase we stumbled upon, and walking up and down to enable me to make this a #stairwalkers shot. I also just reached my one-year anniversary as a mod on the stellar @stairwalkers hub, so it was fun to shoot a people on stairs image - with a #reflectiongram twist - for the first time in a long time. #wongskistaircases

No I'm not quitting my day job and becoming a food blogger, but here's a shot from the last stop on the preview tour for @dineoutvanfest, running Jan 20-Feb 5: the beautiful @lapentola, where we had Italian food and drink that elegantly hit the spot.

The second stop on the preview tour for @dineoutvanfest, running Jan. 20-Feb. 5, was @housespecial.ca, where we had delicious modern Vietnamese cuisine, including: Vietnamese Festival Cake, Chicken Pomelo Salad, Da Nang Octopus Two Ways, Canh Chua Sablefish, and Beef Wellington. The beautifully plated dishes were paired with smooth reds and whites from BC-based @churchandstatewines. Plus there was the mind-blowing Graham Greene red cocktail paired with dessert. 🍷 Hmmm, I could get used to this being back in IG thing. 🤔#dinearound2017 #DOFV #findingwongskifood

One week from today on Jan. 20 @dineoutvanfest will begin, running until Feb. 5. Yesterday I got to go on a preview of the food & drink festival that took us to 3 participating Yaletown restaurants. The first stop was @minamiyaletown, where we had divine offerings, including the lunch appetizer pictured: Aburi Sashimi, Sous Vide Octopus and Market Citrus, Miko Sakekasu Baked Sablefish, and Sesame Soy Glazed Obie Braiser. Aesthetically sublime food and great company of foodie IGers lured me out of my IG break, at least for a day, and I'm glad it did. Hope you're all doing well! #dinearound2017 #DOVF #findingwongskifood

Even though I'm still on an IG break, I couldn't resist the allure of going to today's instameet at the dress rehearsal for #balletbcprogram1. The choreography of the program's four pieces - all by Cayetano Soto - was sublime, and the dancing by @balletbc was entrancing. Many thanks to @instameetvancouver and @balletbc for once again inviting IGers. I highly recommend catching the show, which goes until Nov. 5. As for my IG break, it's going to continue, but please know that I miss y'all a huge amount. See you soon. #wongskidance

Friends, it's time for me to take a break from IG. I've been working on a book about Vancouver jazz history for three years, and I need to focus on that passion project. While I will continue to serve as a moderator once a week with the great @stairwalkers hub, I'm going to walk away from daily IG life for awhile. I will miss you and your beautiful posts enormously. Thank you for the incredible support, inspiration, and friendship. I'll see you on the other side of the vanishing point. 💙

What you see: tasty dishes and cool drinks  @nomad_vancouver. Who you don't see: the crew that calls itself #thestinkybunch. I'm going to share one endearing fact about each of them. @glenny.gs: She has an amazing memory. @jackymchui: He likes to keep his all-white kicks in pristine, mint condition. @tokyo_to: She's as big a music freak as I am, if not bigger. @dorringtonr: He likes dark, grey days and strongly dislikes warm, sunny ones. For these and many other reasons, I'm super fond of the Stinky Bunch. #findingwongskifood

What I don't know: What this mural by @pricq that was part of @vanmuralfest is all about. What I do know: "Kids" is a sublime work of street art. Being open to interpretation adds to its appeal.

As a roadtrip warrior who's driven on long journeys two summers in a row, I enjoy that feeling of driving under a beautiful blue sky. I frequently stop at viewpoints to get a skyshot, which my wife patiently puts up with. I've had a great time collaborating with @MazdaCanada on their Summer Escape contest! To enter, take a driving-inspired photo or video and post it by August 31 with the tags #MazdaContest and #Sky. You could win a 2-night summer escape. Visit @MazdaCanada for more info. Best of luck!

Oysters anyone? Many thanks to @leilalikes for being the irrepressible catalyst for a great night with friends. It included tasty dishes @merchantsvan and thirst-quenching beer, cider, and wine at the @libertywinemerchants Best of Craft BC fundraiser for Greater Vancouver Food Bank. #findingwongskifood

My plan was to get a looking down shot of an outdoor spiral staircase with a big green fern in the middle. That was a bust because of harsh light and evil shadows. So I pointed my camera up instead. Hope you like the consolation prize.

99.9% of my staircase shots result from advance research and planning. It's fun to execute shots you've been envisioning in your head. But this one I completely stumbled upon without any previous knowledge. It was sweetly satisfying to enjoy the moment of spontaneously discovering this SF spiral gem. #wongskistaircases

San Francisco's Mission District is heaven for mural lovers. This shows just part of a large mural celebrating women. Thanks to @swongski for agreeing to stride by here and every time we saw a nice mural. Her silly dad is so demanding! #lifewiththewongskis #wongskimurals

Here's Part 3 of photos from Havana's Instituto Superior de Arte. My last two shots in the series captured abandoned buildings; this one shows the amazing geometry of a restored and functioning building: the School of Plastic Arts (Visual Arts). It also shows @swongski, who I'm excited to see dance in San Francisco tonight. Stay tuned for Oregon/California road trip pics! #lifewiththewongskis #wongskisincuba

Part 2: If you saw my last post with the really long caption then you know that my family and I explored the abandoned and decaying buildings of the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana. Here's a shot of centre stage in the performance hall of the institute's unfinished ballet school, which served at one point as the main ring of a Russian circus school. It was incredible to see the intricate pattern of light streaming through the dome just as the architects had envisioned before construction was halted in 1965. Thanks to @girlgonecoastal for requesting to see shots from inside, which I wasn't going to post because I thought they weren't "IG-friendly". I realized that's a silly thought, and hopefully you agree. #wongskisincuba

Part 1: In 1961 Fidel Castro and Che Guevara visited the Havana Country Club. They came up with the idea of transforming the elite golf club into an international art school that would offer free education. They commissioned Cuban architect Ricardo Porro to design the campus, and he recruited two Italian architects to help. They came up with a beautiful and experimental design, but by 1965 it was only partially built. While the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) did open and remains a functioning school today, a number of the domed buildings were unfinished, abandoned, and overgrown. They've stayed that way for more than 50 years. We had to see this. At the front gate the security guard said we needed to wait for someone to approve our entry. No one showed up. Then a cab pulled up with three women from Geneva who also wanted to go in. One of them devised a plan: they would go with the cab driver to find an unguarded side entrance and send him back to take us there. Sure enough the guy, driving a beautiful cherry red Bel Air, came back and brought us to an unfenced spot right next to the main cluster of abandoned buildings. It was amazing to explore the brick and terracotta buildings on the vast and bucolic grounds with not another soul around (the Swiss gals had left). I never thought exploring abandoned buildings could be a family activity, but that's exactly what it was, along with being an unforgettable experience. #lifewiththewongskis #wongskistories #wongskisincuba

We interrupt Cuban latergrams with an invigorating soy matcha latte and hipster magazine break. Many thanks to @pork_ninjas and @portocoffee for hosting a fun event yesterday at this beautiful café, where we indulged in delicious charcuterie, Italian rosé, sangria, and more. I needed this after experiencing a horrible technology failure a few hours before. There's nothing like comfort food and drink to soothe the blues. 💚

Cuban strideby ... In Havana, we stayed in an apartment with a perfect location, steps away from La Bodeguita del Medio, a famous restaurant-bar where Ernest Hemingway held court and drank a lot of mojitos. Every day at La Bodeguita, musicians played some of the liveliest tunes I heard in Cuba. Meanwhile our apartment that we found through @airbnb was an oasis of calm. Thanks to @swongski for expertly striding by above the colourful courtyard outside of our door. 💙 #lifewiththewongskis #wongskisincuba

In Habana Vieja (Old Havana), there are architectural gems around every corner, like this neoclassical beauty (Hotel Palacio O'Farrill) built in 1909. While more and more buildings are being restored, many have a fading elegance. Cuba can be intense, with all of its sights and sounds, and in our case: numerous people asking if we were from China, Japan, Korea, or somewhere else in Asia. We enjoyed a few moments of calm in this lovely courtyard. 🍃 #wongskisincuba

Sometimes there are photos in your head you just need to get. This is one of those images. I was determined to get a sunset shot near Havana's iconic Malecón seawall, so I went with my family here at golden hour. Seeing the fishermen in silhouette made it extra sweet. 🌅🎣 #wongskisincuba

I've climbed up many staircases, with the goal of getting to the top to take a shot of the artistry below. But I've never been as out of breath as I was while going up this Art Deco beauty, in an apartment building known as Edificio Cuervo Rubio across from the Hotel Nacional. To get here we went on a marathon walk from Old Havana to the Vedado neighbourhood, in sweltering heat. So I was parched and exhausted by the time we got to the stairs, but it was totally worth it. Thanks to @swongski for kindly going up with me and expertly turning this into a #stairwalkers shot. 💛#theworldneedsmorespiralstaircases #yellowoclock #wongskistaircases #lifewiththewongskis #wongskisincuba

What you see: a Chevrolet convertible that's a pristine example of the classic American cars from the 1950s that I became obsessed with photographing in Havana. What you don't see: the tourists haggling with these dudes who own the car about how much it would cost to drive them around. In Cuba, you get a lot of practice in the art of negotiation. ❤️ #wongskisincuba

So yes, I'm alive! Yesterday I returned from an amazing 11-day trip to Cuba with my family, and the whole time we were off the grid - no IG or any Internet the entire time. I enjoyed the break from connectivity but I missed your galleries enormously so I'll be catching up. Meanwhile here's my first Cuban post, which captures Havana's street life and beautiful architecture after a brief late afternoon downpour that provided much-needed relief from the blazing sun and heat. 🌴🇨🇺 #wongskisincuba #wongskireflections

My good friend @dorringtonr has his own hashtag for his awesome food shots, and I'm going to shamelessly steal and adapt it. So introducing ... #findingwongskifood. Thanks to @yvreats and Dorri for joining me @anhandchi, my favourite new Vancouver restaurant. The delicious plates #onthetable: Grilled lemongrass chicken and pork chop, Vietnamese crêpe, Street-side platter, and Candied ginger and Salty plum sodas.

My latest posts were busy and edit-heavy so I'm slowing it down with this 100% no filter/99.9% no edit shot. I'm also posting this for the @lonelywhale and @bluemindfund IG challenge to raise ocean awareness by tagging pics with #100daysofblue and #makeasplash. Finally, I'm dedicating this to @bluemoodz - whose sublime photo was featured in the very worthy challenge - because her seascapes and positivity are so inspiring. 💙

Today on Father's Day I'm doing what I enjoy: hanging out with family, posting this stairs/architecture shot, and watching major championship golf on TV.

I could have asked her to dial back the megawatt smile to make this portrait moody in that certain IG way, but that wouldn't have accurately reflected how euphoric @swongski was before her grad prom the other night. The beautiful smile was a joyful release after five years of hard work as a student, dancer, and world citizen. I was smiling too, beaming with love and admiration about all that she's achieved and how elegant Sarah looked in her sweatshop-free ensemble. Above all, I'm happy that my daughter and son are independent thinkers who follow their creative passion. #lifewiththewongskis #whpgetclose

Last night I provided in-person IT support for my mom, who was having a problem with her iPad. Then I picked up my dear wife, who's been working long hours. I had some time in between to spontaneously go on a solo sunset mission. Many thanks to these important women in my life for getting me out of the house to capture this.

I was in heaven today because I had lunch with good friends and the focus was on my absolute favourite comfort food: ramen. I'm pretty picky about my ramen but the bowls #onthetable - Miso, Tori Shio, and Tonkatsu - were delicious and had the harmony of elements that makes for great ramen. Many thanks to @benkeiramen owner Minako-San for her welcoming hospitality and to @yvreats for organizing the lunch. Already thinking about making a return visit - soon! 🍜 #findingwongskifood

I didn't have a lot of time to explore Palm Springs but I had to see the @parkerpalmsprings hotel, which has a storied history and quirky design. It opened in 1959 as California's first Holiday Inn and the singing cowboy Gene Autry once owned it. Robert Downey Jr. was arrested there in 2000 (in room 311). It became the Parker in 2004 and has been a celebrity magnet over the years. Posing in front of the hotel's striking cinder block entrance are two very nice and talented people I enjoyed meeting at the @bloguettes InstaCamp: @audriestorme and @raleighwilson.

The last two nights I saw the Arts Umbrella Dance Company perform its Season Finale, and I was literally on the edge of my seat, exhilarated by what I was witnessing. There are two more performances today, and I'll be at both shows to experience more sublime contemporary dance. Huge congrats to the dancers, their teachers, and choreographers for creating such profound art. Special shoutout to @swongski - I'm so proud of you. Photos can't be taken at the shows but I took this shot a number of weeks ago of a remarkable piece, choreographed by James Kudelka and simply titled "choreography", that they're performing at Season Finale. Another piece called "The Paris Sessions" that they're closing every show with, choreographed by Crystal Pite, is the most amazing dance creation I've ever seen. I never could have predicted I would become such a huge dance fan, but thanks to @artsumbrelladance and @balletbc, I definitely have. #wongskidance

At 7 am on Saturday, the umbrellas were zipped up tight and it was just me and the pool cleaner poolside. By the afternoon, there were revellers all around and inside the pool. Meanwhile, in other areas of @thesaguarops, the @bloguettes InstaCamp was in full swing with more than 100 campers, camp counsellors, and camp directors including me learning about the power of @instagram. I had a great time leading four 80-minute workshops, where we practiced capturing impactful landscape, architecture, and strideby shots. Many thanks to the campers for your incredible enthusiasm. Congrats to @paperheartmx for winning a @moment wide angle lens for posting the best shot from my sessions. Huge thanks to @sakuraconsidine, @callmelore, @r.vaneck, and the whole @bloguettes team for including me and providing such amazing support. And thanks to all of you for your awesome support of my Palm Springs adventure. I'm sorry that I've fallen behind in replying to your kind comments and checking out your beautiful photos. I'm going to take some time to recharge and catch up with you. In the days leading up to this I've observed and felt some unease about recent changes to IG and whether they've been good for engagement. This experience affirmed what hasn't changed: it's the warm people and meaningful connections - enabled by IG - that matter the most. #bloguettesinstacamp #wongskistories #wongskireflections

The shot you get after three things happen: You receive the raddest birthday present of a wide angle lens that attaches to your iPhone; your awesome pal @glenny.gs expertly embodies #tinypeopleinbigplaces; and a friendly bird flies by at just the right time. Big thanks to @moment for sponsoring the landscape workshops I'll be teaching this Saturday at the @bloguettes InstaCamp in Palm Springs and providing the prize of a lens for the best photo taken at the workshops, which I'll be choosing.

Whenever I've had the pleasure of hanging out with @ave.camilla, her expression has rarely been this moody. 99.9% of the time she has a big smile on her face. So maybe I chose to post this shot from yesterday's fun #ciaoavecamilla meet because I'm a wannabe fashion photographer? Only the IG Gods know, but I know this for sure: Camilla is a warm, generous, and inspiring person who I will miss a ton after she moves to Toronto. I'm also going to take this opportunity to say she writes #captionsthatrock. Paired with the stylish shots in her beautiful gallery, her captions are endearingly self-deprecating, funny, and down-to-earth. Ciao for now my lovely friend!

I saw @balletbc perform Program 3 a second time last night, and I was captivated again with the beautiful and inventive contemporary dance. This is a shot of Peter Smida and Alexis Fletcher dancing exquisitely in a gorgeous piece, "I and I am You", choreographed by Jorma Elo. There's one more show tonight to complete Ballet BC's 30th anniversary season - wish I could go. #balletbc30three #instameetvancouver #wongskidance

I've been to all three of Ballet BC's shows this season, and once again I was blown away by the imaginative choreography and impactful dancing. This is a shot from "Bill", a intensely sublime piece choreographed by Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar and originally performed by Israel's great @batshevadancecompany. If you're in Vancouver, I urge you to see Program 3, running May 12-14. We're incredibly lucky to have a contemporary dance company that performs at such a transcendent level. As for the dance photography, it was super challenging as always, but I'm now completely in love with the art of capturing dancers in motion. #balletbc30three #instameetvancouver #wongskidance

Here's the looking up bookend to the looking down stairs shot I posted last week. Call me crazy but when I gaze up at a vintage staircase like this one, I see pure beauty. #wongskistaircases

California Dreamin' ... Excited that we'll be driving to San Francisco this summer. We also drove there last summer, so I'm looking forward to changing up the route and seeing more incredible views like this one. If you have any suggestions for places to stop between Vancouver and SF, on the coast or inland, please leave a comment. Thanks!

What's my addiction? Drinking martinis? 🍸 No. Watching Netflix? 📺 Not really. Vaping? 🚬 Definitely not. Shooting cool staircases? 🌀 Bingo! I get a rush of excitement when I look down from the top or up from the bottom of one, and I dream about finding new ones. That's how entranced I am with the design of geometrically beautiful staircases. So it was a very good day when my dear wife reported that she saw a stunning one in her friend's apartment building, which I've driven by many times, oblivious to what's inside. The friend was willing to let me in to shoot it. That's how I ended up in this historic seven-storey, Georgian Revival building, completed in 1912. According to lore, it was once the home of @justinpjtrudeau, @officialsarahmclachlan, and a few other celebs. Apparently Emily Carr also gave art lessons to a friend there. As we start to run out of interesting staircases in public buildings to shoot, I think apartment buildings will be the next frontier. So it was exciting to see this, especially with my stairs buddy @yvr.alana. Big thanks to my wife and her friend, and to Alana for expertly playing the part of the #instagrammerdown. Check out the superb shot she took in her awesome gallery. If you know of any great staircases in apartment buildings please leave a comment. May the stairs be with you. 🔦 #wongskistaircases

The delicious lunch you reward yourself with after struggling through the @bmovanmarathon half-marathon on a warm morning, but ultimately getting across that finish line. Huge congrats to @jackymchui and @caitlindskoog for running their first full marathons and to @misonani for doing the half. On the table @anhandchi: Hủ Tiếu Khô (tossed noodles). Strange fact: there's a difference of less than a minute in my chip time (total running time) with my last five half-marathons. Just call me Consistent Chris! #findingwongskifood

Exactly two weeks ago I was lucky to see this with @glenny.gs. And three weeks from today I'll be lucky again, as I'll be teaching mobile photography at the @bloguettes InstaCamp. I want to share the luck. I have one free registration to give away to the fun and informative camp. If you're able to get yourself to the @thesaguarops in Palm Springs on May 21, all you have to do is leave a comment saying why you would like to attend, and I'll choose the person with the best comment. Or tag someone and they can leave a comment. Go to bloguettes.com/event/instacamp for details on InstaCamp, which will include workshops on shooting portraits/lifestyle, landscape photography, product styling, editing, and branding. I'll announce the winner in comments to this post. Have a great weekend folks! 💗 #wongskireflections

Tales From Railtown, a one-act play starring @dorringtonr, @amandalcam, and @brendenzap. The scene: Three magnetic Instagramers, all wearing jean jackets, sit on a bench in front of @askforluigi. A crowd gathers. Brenden: "All we did was sit here together and now 30 people are taking photos of us." Dorrington: "I feel like a rock star." Amanda: "You are one!" B: "We should form a band, with me on lead vocals and guitar, Amanda on bass and vocals, and Dorri on drums." D: "What should we call ourselves?" A: "I don't know but let's ask Luigi." B: "I asked and he came up with a brilliant name: the Denim Gang." D: "What music will we play?" A: "Our unique sound will be Rush (progressive hard rock) meets Sleater-Kinney (riot grrrl)." B: "When should we make our debut?" D: "How about at the dancestameet Wongski is planning to hold this year?" A: "Sounds great!" Narrator: "And that's how the legendary and iconic Denim Gang came to be." The End. 🎤🎸 #railtownmeet

One, two, three jump! ... I wasn't sure how many people would turn out to today's #railtownmeet or whether we would get rained on. We ended up getting a great turnout and the weather Gods cooperated. Our awesome IG community came through again! Massive thanks to my co-host @beyunique for your incredible spirit before and during the #WWIM13 meet in Railtown and Gastown. A big thank you to @westerlygoods for donating three attractive umbrellas for a draw and participating in the fun meet. Huge thanks to everyone who attended, listed below (sorry if I missed you). And thank you to those who couldn't join us but left supportive comments.

Vancity reflections ... In just under 24 hours we'll be gathering for #railtownmeet - an instameet I'm co-hosting with @beyunique as part of this weekend's #WWIM13. We'll meet tomorrow (April 24) at 10 am @birdsandbeets in Gastown and then explore Railtown. We'll circle back and go through Crab Park, where we'll see views like this. The meet will go on rain or shine, and you're encouraged to bring colourful umbrellas to use in shots. On that point, big thanks to @westerlygoods for providing three of their superb umbrellas as prizes at the meet. Really hope to see y'all! Speaking of reflections, huge thanks to the sublime hub @reflectiongram for the feature this week. Many thanks also to the awesome gals @bloguettes for posting one of my reflection shots and a blog interview with me. Getting very excited about teaching at their InstaCamp in Palm Springs on May 21.

I'm excited to announce that I'm co-hosting a #WWIM13 instameet with @beyunique this Sunday, April 24, at 10 am in Vancouver's funky Railtown district. I'm looking forward to co-hosting a meet with Lucy, pictured here in front of a slightly busy Railtown wall, for the third time. We'll meet at the fantastic @birdsandbeets and then walk to Railtown. Hope to see you there! #railtownmeet #wongskimurals

At a mini-instameet this morning with @sllychn, @jeremylim, and @cramosbr, while only two of us had met in person before, we had a great time shooting together in a parkade and spiral staircase and getting to know each other. That's how we roll in IG. Regardless of the new algorithm that's curating our feeds, IG is still the most engaging social space around. Thanks for the fun times Sally, Jeremy, and Cam!

I've had so many great experiences as a member of the @instagram community. I'm going to have another one May 21 in Palm Springs. That's the date I'll lead workshops on landscape photography at the @bloguettes InstaCamp. My working definition of "landscape" will be wide. In hands-on workshops at the ultra colourful @thesaguarops, I'll give tips on composing and shooting images of natural and built environments, with an emphasis on mobile photography. Go to bloguettes.com to find out what InstaCamp will offer for learning how to build your company or personal brand through IG. Thanks very much to @bloguettes, @r.vaneck, and @collectif4249 for making my participation possible. Enjoy your weekend folks! 🌴 #wongskireflections

To offset the return of grey weather to Raincouver, here's another pic from last week's solo sunset mission. I took more than 200 shots that night because I became obsessed with capturing a mini-volleyball game. 🙌🏐 Plus sometimes I go a little overboard with clicking the shutter. 😉

Feeling thankful: For @yvr.alana and her sense of urban adventure that led her to discover this spiffy staircase, and for being an awesome friend; for the painter who turned this into a #stairwalkers shot; and for the sunny, warm weather we've been having, which caused me to sweat profusely in this glass-sheathed staircase, but it was worth it. 😤 #wongskistaircases

When your awesome friend @amandalcam goes to the trouble of creating a hashtag to celebrate adventures with a cute red toque, you gotta show your support by adding a portrait of her to #redtoqueadventures, not to mention #WHPexpressions. Street art by @mwbowen_artist.

Introducing: #captionsthatrock. While I enjoy IG mainly because of the beautiful images, I'm also a huge fan of well-written captions. There's an art to crafting captions that engage and delight, and I'm going to occasionally feature IGers who do exactly that. When I was thinking about who I would feature first, it was an easy decision to pick @caitlindskoog. Her IG bio lists 7 things that she is, and one of them is "Caption essayist". It's an accurate description. Aside from sharing gorgeously moody landscapes, Caity has written heart-wrenching and cathartic caption essays on what it's like to be a nurse on an oncology ward. But then she switches it up completely with whimsical captions about her offbeat cat @gingercatgeorge. It's that combination of humanity and humour that draws me into her long and short-form writing. One of the challenges of this series is figuring out what image I'm going to use when paying tribute to someone's captions. I decided on posting shots I've taken that somehow connect to the captionista. In this case it's a snap of that PNW boathouse that Caity has beautifully photographed countless times. Many thanks to @missyjena for sparking this idea. The visionary creator of #calmversation suggested that I post weekly tips on caption writing, and that evolved to this. #wongskireflections

I've wanted to shoot Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey's ahead-of-their-time architecture @simonfraseru for ages. Thanks to @akaalec (who's expertly striding by), @tannerloveschips (who was a trooper despite some bad luck), and @debuguru (who kindly gave excellent editing advice) for making it happen. #wongskireflections

Patterns on the wall: A riot of colours and shapes that have their own rhyme and reason. Patterns in front of the wall: Two dynamic women who are creative sparks and warm souls. Thanks @amandalcam and @cramosbr for the impromptu shooting sesh and "committee" meeting. #whppatterns #wongskimurals

Duet ... Here's another shot from the @balletbc dress rehearsal for Program 2. I saw the show again last night, and without the distraction of looking through a viewfinder, the captivating beauty of the contemporary dance resonated with me even more. There's one more show tonight. Wish I could go. #BalletBC30two #InstameetVancouver #wongskidance

When I heard that @instameetvancouver was holding an instameet at the dress rehearsal for the @balletbc production of Program 2, and that DSLRs were allowed, I knew I had to be there. I'm so glad I went because the show, entirely choreographed by Medhi Walerski, is beautiful and transcendent. It was also great to see dancers from @artsumbrelladance join the company. If you live in Vancouver and want to experience visionary contemporary dance, definitely go to the show, which runs March 17-19. Many thanks to the meet organizers for letting us shoot Program 2, a sublime work of art. #BalletBC30two #wongskidance

A food shot for the second time in three posts? What's happening in Wongski's World? Maybe all of that staircase hunting has made me hungry? Whatever the reason, many thanks to @kerriebowers for the amazing RawBar sushi @fairmontpacific, champion hand modelling, great conversation, and art watching in the hotel - there's a fun Van Gogh installation - and @vanartgallery. Red tuna tataki, sashimi, and sable motoyaki roll were #onthetable. #findingwongskifood

🍔+🍟=😋 ... Many thanks to @tangoonights for organizing today's delicious tasting brunch at @timbervancouver. While we enjoyed dish after dish of Canadian comfort food in the relaxed ambience at Timber, photographically I focused on this hearty Bison Burger with caramelized onion, bacon, cheddar, and pickles. Of course I had to line it up as symmetrically as possible. Shamelessly standing on a chair may have been involved. The Tangoo app, by the way, recommends restaurants/bars and events that match your mood. I'm notoriously moody so I'm looking forward to seeing what it recommends for me. 🤔 #findingwongskifood

Exactly 14 weeks ago I posted a shot of my awesome pal @cramosbr looking very much like this at the bottom of a spiral staircase we found during an archi adventure. Here's another #instagrammerdown shot I took of Camila at a second spiral we found that memorable day, in a deathly quiet study space called the "Ridington Room". I'm finally posting it now to celebrate her long-awaited return after an extended stay in her native Colombia. 🇨🇴 Time to find more staircases for Cam to elegantly lie down in! 🌀 #wongskistaircases

I'm dedicating this shot to my wonderful wife, who kindly posed near the #busystranger. She's not on @instagram, @facebook, or any other social media. She doesn't even own a cell phone. She prefers connecting with people in real-time, and I really respect her individuality. Yet she's very supportive of my IG life. I'm lucky and thankful. ❤️ #WHPidentity #wongskireflections
