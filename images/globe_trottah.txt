Praying mantises have always fascinated me, with their alien appearance and ninja-like stance. While on a nature hike in Apoala, Mexico, my eagle-eyed friend @oaxsessions spotted this guy perched atop a cactus, swaying with the breeze. Do you have any favourite insects?  #Mexico #WSEtravel

It was a pretty special moment to be in Vietnam during the Asian soccer finals #U23 when they went up against Uzbekistan! There was so much National Pride, something rarely seen here, that even pice officers were getting in the spirit painting their faces and waving flags! I would estimate more than half the city was in the streets watching the game  on outdoor jumbo screens set up all over town! The most incredible part, even though they lost the game in overtime, the celebrations carried on for the next 24 hours!!! Such a special moment to witness.

Thailand and some neighbouring countries are filled with wonder and ancient practices which have carried on to modern times.

Dia de los muertos (day of the dead) is an annual celebration in Mexico which allows families an opportunity to remember their lost loved ones. It is said that by remembering them, they continue  to exist in the afterlife. It is often accompanied by face painting like skeletons, and is full of celebrations, parades, concerts, and more!

A lifeguard tower peers out over the long, wavy beach. Puerto Escondido faces some consistently big waves which are great for surfing year round, though not great for swimming.

The Laguna Colorada (know as the Red Lagoon in english) is more than 4200 meters above sea level, surrounded by volcanos and attracts thousands of flamingos who come to gorge on the red algae (which give the lake its colour).

A lone sheep hanging out 4000 meters above sea level at the top of Isla del Sol (island of the sun) in the middle of Lake Titicaca, Bolivia. Sheep and donkeys are amongst the only animals you'll find in the farming communities seen here. Both are for practical use - sheep for wool and donkeys for labour. What is your favourite farm animal? #Bolivia #WSEtravel

There's pretty funky weather here in Cusco! Sunny, then raining, hot then cold, clear then foggy, and that's just in one day! That means there's regularly rainbows to be seen too! Really a magical city full of culture, history, food, mountains... and rainbows?! What is your favourite town to visit? #Cusco #WSEtravel

Cusco is a gorgeous town nestled high in the Peruvian Andes mountain range. Located in the thin air above altitude, these beautiful yet steep and winding roads can take your breath away in more than one way. Have you ever visited a town in the mountains? #Cusco #WSEtravel

Swimming in deep underground cenotes in the Yucatan and Quintana Roo has to be one of my new most favourite pastimes. This massive underground network connecting the water table was exposed when fragments of the roof caved in (a very long time ago) making picture perfect swimming holes! The water is fresh and there is even SCUBA options between some cenotes via underwater caves... and there are hundreds of them! Absolutely love it! Have you been to a cenote? If so, what was your favourite? #Mexico #Yucatan #WSEtravel
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8943aa388ca53e9b98b253a75773e5bc/5BCCF9FA/t51.2885-15/e35/17663221_434435920229314_3762171607884234752_n.jpg
Cenotes are underground river and waterways where the roof (Earth's surface) collapsed to reveal themselves to the world. They are paradise in a hole, and you can find them all over the Yucatan and Quintana Roo region of Mexico. Many have small entrance fees but they are all incredibly cool and refreshing to go for a swim and a perfect way to spend an afternoon! Have you ever visited a cenote before? #Mexico #WSEtravel

Those who know me best, know it's impossible for me to walk past #animals without stopping and having a quick chat (and pet, if they're friendly). This guy hangs out in my local caf√© in #Oaxaca and is a total suck! Love his multi-coloured eyes and tiny legs! üòÑ
