Back in the saddle! Had a few weeks of forced downtime after a bout with some gnarly plantar fasciitis. Got a nice long trail run in Wilder Ranch State Park to kick off the weekend. #feelsgoodman #trailporn #humblesea #santacruz

Volc√°n de Fuego has been on my mind nonstop since I heard the news of the eruption on Sunday. Less than 3 months ago I was on Fuego, just below the summit. We then camped on neighboring Acatenango and listened to the loud sounds of eruptions all night. Today, the landscape is completely changed. Densely populated villages are gone. My heart breaks for the families torn apart by the eruption and the thousands of people that have been displaced. I‚Äôm still looking into the best way to donate to rescue and relief efforts. Normally I turn to Charity Navigator but surprisingly they don‚Äôt have much on Guatemala in relation to this tragedy. Leaning towards GoFundMe... If you have any insight on how to best help, please let me know. @guatemala.guatemala #üá¨üáπ #volcandefuego #acatenango #guatemala

Another awesome Colorado weekend in the books. I deferred on posting this because I couldn‚Äôt choose just 10 photos from the weekend to share... an awesome reunion with lots of close friends, loads of great Denver beer and food, 3 incredible @thediscobiscuits shows... and Makena went backstage at Red Rocks! Much love to @jennerama and @campbellonious for the photos and the hook up.

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the culture surrounding the Grateful Dead. I read ‚ÄúThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test‚Äù in high school, and since then I always romanticized the Merry Pranksters, Ken Kesey, Furthur, and the whole 60s mythology. What I wouldn‚Äôt give to be a fly on the wall during those wild Prankster parties in La Honda‚Ä¶ When I heard that La Honda was opening some trails up to the public (via La Honda Creek Open Space Preserve) I knew that I had to come check it out. I spent the morning at Facebook yesterday, and it dawned on me that I wasn‚Äôt far from La Honda. Luckily I had my running gear in the car with me. I won‚Äôt lie and say that I felt the spirit of the 60s while running through the rolling hills of the open space preserve. I didn‚Äôt trip over any vials of orange sunshine. I had the Dead in my ears for about 20 minutes until I concluded, once again, that it‚Äôs just not good cardio music. I did find extreme solitude, though. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever run for that long (~9 miles) without seeing another human. It was just me, hundreds of cows, and a few snakes out there. A lot of the trails were overgrown - not to an annoying extent, but serving as a reminder that folks don‚Äôt make it out there too often. La Honda is absolutely beautiful. ‚ÄúRolling hills‚Äù would be an understatement - I was going either uphill or downhill the entire time. I hit almost 2k ft of elevation gain over just shy of 9 miles. If you‚Äôre interested in checking it out, there‚Äôs free parking off of Sears Ranch Road. I ran down Harrington Creek Trail, around Folger Ranch Loop and back up Harrington Creek to the parking area. Also, somewhat unrelated... A friendly reminder to check the ‚Äúborn on‚Äù date on your beer. I ended up with a #shelfturd from Hop Dogma yesterday. These New England-style IPAs do NOT age well. Lucky for me, there‚Äôs a legendary dive bar just down the road. If you ever find yourself in La Honda, pull up a stool at Apple Jacks, you‚Äôll be happy you did. #LaHonda #TrailPorn #SantaCruzMountains #trailrunning #trailrun #instarunner #runtrails #igrunners #igrunning #opentrails #runwithaview

Not sure that anything will ever top the epic views from our 2 days on Volc√°n Acatenango. We hiked from La Soledad to base camp (about 300 meters below Acatenango summit), and then pushed on to the ridge, where we hung out just below the peak of the active volcano (Volc√°n de Fuego) during sunset. 5,180ft elevation over 7.24 mi total. Thick clouds rolled in and prevented us from seeing the eruptions from up close, but they created an eerie vibe that was very cool in and of itself. We marched back down to base camp, and the clouds cleared up, allowing us to watch the volcano shoot glowing red lava into the sky while we sat in awe around the campfire. We ‚Äúslept‚Äù for about 4 hours (while listening to the thunderous booms of the volcano throughout the night) and then woke up before dawn for another 1000ft hike to Acatenango summit for sunrise, where this photo was taken. #volcanacatenango #volcandefuego #acatenango #guatemala

A few shots* from an incredible hike on Volcan Acatenango in Guatemala. This is a 13,000 ft volcano. Climbing 5k‚Äô elevation over ~7 miles was fairly brutal, but the views were worth it. I failed to capture this bad boy exploding after dark (forgot my tripod) but suffice to say that watching a massive volcano spew glowing fire into the sky with thunderous booms all night was one of the coolest experiences ever. Waking up throughout the night to ground-shaking eruptions and peeking out the tent to see a fire-filled sky was truly surreal. *Photos frantically selected during a fleeting moment of WiFi, quality may vary.  #acatenango #volcanacatenango #guatemala #13000 #volcanochoir

I love the idea of stitching together running routes. I do a lot of trail running in the Berkeley hills, but I usually drive up there. Driving to run is a strange concept, and in this case it only saves me 4 miles/600‚Äô elevation. Why compartmentalize sea level runs from trail runs? On Saturday I had the urge to run from my doorstep to Grizzly Peak (1800‚Äô). This is such a cool way to gain context for Berkeley, and I hope to do more of it in the future. It‚Äôs only ~5 more miles to Wildcat Canyon, so...

I love having Redwood Regional Park in my backyard... it makes quick post-work trail runs like this possible. Perhaps I was a tad ambitious with my route, or just underestimated the relentless elevation. I ended up running in the dark for the last 2 miles or so. Luckily I've been running with a tiny, super-bright flashlight (Fenix E15) that alleviated this issue. Tonight was the first time I've actually used it on the trail and I was very grateful to have it with me. It‚Äôs pretty rad. 450 lumens, weighs about 4 ounces, USB rechargeable. You‚Äôd think they were paying me to write this. Oh, and the beer, "Stonefruit Swirl‚Äù from @TemescalBeer. A "milkshake style" IPA, tart/peach with lots of vanilla. A little too much lactose for my tastes, particularly mid-trail run. I'd love to try a milkshake IPA that's a little less sweet. I've had a number of these from other breweries (namely @TiredHandsBrewing) that I felt the same way about. Decent beer nonetheless, but probably more enjoyable in a different (non-cardio) scenario.

Wow‚Ä¶ 10 years ago today, @CortneyLea16 and I were gearing up for a flight from JFK to Ghana. We spent most of our time volunteering at Ve Deme Orphanage in the the Volta Region, teaching kids Science and English‚Ä¶ But we also made plenty of time to travel around and see the countryside. There was no shortage of daunting hikes, feeding monkeys, being humbled by massive waterfalls, bribing crooked cops in Togo, eating meatpies, getting tested for malaria after repeated fainting spells, teaching sex ed at a local high school, CRUSHING @fanmilklimited_ghana, trying "snuff" with locals, drinking cheap liquor with expats, and so much more. This trip was truly a transformative experience for me at a pivotal time in my life (post-college), and I think of it fondly and often. I‚Äôd really love to make it back there someday to see how those wonderful kids are doing‚Ä¶ And get some more FanMilk. Oh, and to this day, if you search for "morning beers" on Google Images, there's a photo of Cortney and I crushing some delicious breakfast brews in Accra. That's my legacy. #InstaGhana #GyeNyame #WestAfrica #Ghana #Accra #Togo #Ghanaian

Your standard training tempo run is much more appealing as a trail run‚Ä¶ With some sunshine at the end. @lawsonsfinest... Actually, if we're being honest, I wrote that for the beer pun, but doing a tempo run on a hilly trail is dumb and I wouldn't do it again. Thanks for the #beermail @chrismhoff!

A few highlights from a recent backpacking trip on Rae Lakes Loop in Kings Canyon National Park. This was a few weeks ago (late September) but it's still on my mind. Words really can't describe the beauty out there... That being said, I'm hoping to find some time over the next few weeks to finish up a blog post that ties this all together while it's still fresh in my mind.

My first Burning Man. I'm awestruck and not sure how to summarize in a short post on Instagram. Overwhelming in the best possible way. A true testament to human creativity and ingenuity. Significantly larger (and much more humbling) than I ever imagined. Also dusty AF. Can't wait to revisit with more time, better preparation, and more friends in tow.

24 hours ago, if you told me I'd be heading to Burning Man this weekend, I'm not sure I would have believed you...

While staring directly into the sun this morning, it dawned on me that it‚Äôs been exactly one year since we moved to the Bay Area. One year jam-packed full of major life changes and countless adventures. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why it flew by so quickly? It feels like we‚Äôve been here for 4 months. I‚Äôm sitting here in our campsite at Mt. Diablo State Park waiting for this #2017Eclipse to pop off, working remotely and eating breakfast with my family, feeling incredibly grateful for the privilege to have moved from one amazing city to the next. #LAtoTheBay

Les doing his thing with Primus at the Greek last night. Fantastic show from them, as usual. So cool to see them at such an epic venue. Clutch opened and played a killer set as well.

10 years ago, I convinced some friends (pictured: Kyle and @BucketFullOfThoughts) to come with me to a little festival called @Camp_Bisco. 8/17/07. This was my first time seeing @TheDiscoBiscuits, and my young mind was blown away by everything - the music, the scene, the camaraderie, dedication and extensive knowledge of the fans‚Ä¶ And the lawlessness of it all. I was blown away by some of the other bands there, like Sound Tribe, Umphreys, Amon Tobin, Orchard Lounge, Ott, Shpongle/Hallucinogen, etc. Soon after Camp I spent a month volunteering in Ghana, and my little iPod nano was filled with this new music I had discovered. My musical world, previously 80% metal, evolved in a major way on that trip. But I digress. I was 23 at the time, and was undeniably at Camp Bisco for the party. As such, I didn't waste much time with my camera, and these photos are some of the very few that I have from that first year. I never would have guessed that I'd come back for 7 consecutive years of Camp, or that this goofy band would go on to alter the course of my life in some major ways. The unmatched energy of their music gave me the motivation needed to become a lifetime runner, and they've carried me through four marathons and countless other races. I knew that @WanderlustinLauren was the one when I saw her "I finally get it!" face during Helicopters at her first Camp, a few years later. I‚Äôve also forged some lifetime friendships over a mutual obsession with this band. I can‚Äôt forget 3 unbelievable trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic to see this band, not to mention countless memories following them to venues and festivals around the country with friends. The uninitiated tend to be baffled by the time investment, and that‚Äôs okay. I get it. This music is intense and jarring - definitely not for everyone. The Biscuits ruined other music for me, in the best possible way, and I'm beyond excited for what the rest of 2017 (and beyond) has in store. They nasty but they good.

Yesterday: #JerryDay and some Contains No Juice at McLaren Park in The Excelsior. Beautiful weather for a free outdoor concert (@MelvinSealsandJGB). Probably should have gotten that one in focus. Oh yeah, and this stage is named "Jerry Garcia Ampitheatre"! Pretty cool.

Fit in a nice after-work 8 mile trail run up in Strawberry Canyon this evening. Wasn't sure what to expect up there after the Grizzly Peak fire yesterday... But the only fire I found up there was this ridiculous @MoonrakerBrewing/@AlvaradoStreetBrewery collab DIPA, "Spaced Out". A fitting way to celebrate #IPADay. It was canned mere hours before I opened it! What a world. This was my second time taking a cold one out on the trail. I definitely recommend enjoying a beer midway through a trail run while watching the sunset... But I don't recommend having an 8% DIPA and then bombing down 3 miles of dirt hills in the dark. Thanks for hooking up the zero day beer, @cat.hair.everywhere!

I got in a nice lil‚Äô post-MozCon run around Seattle yesterday. Ran around Lake Union, through Gas Works Park, found the Fremont Bridge Troll (and took a #trollfie, which is a thing), stopped for a pour at Fremont Brewing, and then ended my run at Holy Mountain Brewing‚Ä¶ Which I learned is named after my favorite Sleep album (‚ÄúSleep‚Äôs Holy Mountain‚Äù). Epic beer, and beautiful weather to boot. I‚Äôm here in Seattle for work and without much free time to explore, so I‚Äôm feeling pretty content with how well this all came together.

Only now getting around to posting this over a week later, but I had such a blast at #HighSierraMusicFestival this year. I've been to more festivals than I can count, but in terms of sheer fun, creativity, distractions, and all-around awesome people, High Sierra takes the cake every year. This is a shot of our camp, Camp Zesty, after our big campground party with @ShakyFeelin on Friday. It's impossible to capture all of the chaos in a single photo, but this one does a decent job. Whoever managed to rally most of us together for this shot deserves a medal. #hsmf2017 #festivalseason

Last minute run through Wildcat Canyon Regional Park. Inspired by @beeerrunner, I decided to take some ale out on the trail for the first time‚Ä¶ @wanderlustinlauren bought me a new hydration pack and the can fit in there perfectly. First 4 miles were a slow climb to an abandoned Nike missile radar site at 1100 feet. From there, it's rolling hills along a ridge with stunning views. As the last sliver of sunset vanished I stopped to crack open my beer, expecting it to explode everywhere. I gave it about 30 seconds to settle, and it was fine - no eruption to speak of! At dusk, I heard a coyote howl nearby. Then I heard two. I finished my beer and started moving again. Within 10 seconds there were dozens of them shrieking, barking, and yipping. The faster I ran, the more of 'em I heard. By the time I got back to the road it was completely dark and I was fairly spooked, and ready for the comfort of my car. I love the last few miles of this route along the ridgeline, it‚Äôs some of the most fun trail running I‚Äôve done.

Caught my 3rd #IronMaiden show last night, with Ghost opening. The production on this show was the best I've seen yet from them. Awesome stage setup that changed every few songs. Bruce never stopped moving and seemed more energetic than ever! Ghost killed it as usual too. #TheBookOfSoulsWorldTour

I read about @StravaRun's #MyMile challenge and immediately thought to myself, "I can probably beat my best 1 mile time." I wasn't even sure what my mile PR was, as I've never trained specifically for speed at that distance. I checked, it was 6:41. It doesn't take much to get me excited about something. I made several attempts to beat that time this month, via mile splits, as part of my interval runs. It dawned on me that I generally push myself to a 6 or 7 during my "on" intervals. On these runs, I pushed myself to what felt like a 9, and was dying after each run, as I jogged away from the track half bent-over, choking for air. After my fastest attempt, as I limped off of the track after my last interval, I passed a lady outside in the parking lot who was unloading stuff rom her car. She looked at me - a wheezing, sweaty, pathetic mess - clapped her hands, and shouted ‚Äúyeah, you did it! I don‚Äôt know what you did, but you did it!" I laughed, and felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Oh yeah, and I cut 11 seconds off of my fastest mile split - 6:30. It‚Äôs funny how these random little moments we experience while running stick with us and motivate us to try even harder next time.

Back to the real world after a nice long family trip to Hawaii. I have to share this photo from Saturday at Kauai's Waimea Canyon, aka "The Grand Canyon of Hawaii". Spectacular is the only word I can use the describe the views. After seeing this I'm now hellbent on returning to hike the NƒÅ Pali Coast. All too often I get home from a trip, get busy with life, and never get around to going through my photos. Gonna try not to let that happen this time around - I've got my work cut out for me!

Got to the summit of Haleakala (10,023') just in time to catch the sun rise over the clouds from the rim of the crater, and then bombed 23 miles back down to sea level...

Impromptu Mount Diablo hike today. Roughly 12 miles, 3200 ft of elevation gain and a delicious @ModernTimesBeer/@CellarmakerBrewing collab IPA ("Clear and Present Dankness") at the peak. Feeling grateful for convenient access to so many awesome trails and parks... I've barely scratched the surface.

Feeling nostalgic AF (and old) over the fact that Street Fighter II: The World Warrior came out TWENTY FIVE YEARS ago today in Japan. June 10, 1992. Still pretty damn fun to play today, too. Celebrating with a cold glass of @FieldworkBrewingCo "Tiger Uppercut" IPA (not pictured) while I rip through this classic fighter on the Raspberry Pi.

I decided to check out #LittleYosemite in Sunol Regional Wilderness this morning. Once I hit the road, I realized I forgot my headphones... Figured it'd be interesting (and probably much safer) to try a trail run with no music. I've been running almost exclusively WITH music for 10+ years now, so I wasn‚Äôt sure how it‚Äôd work out, but I actually really enjoyed it. My mental state was comparable to that achieved while backpacking - sorting through life‚Äôs challenges, prioritizing things that I want to do, etc - but I was content (and just as blessed out) as I am WITH music. I did wish I had some energizing tunes during the ~1200' climb in the first 2 miles, but once I got the elevation out of the way I didn‚Äôt miss having music at all. Oh yeah - if you‚Äôre curious about this route, the downhill singletrack portion on Cerro Este Road>McCorkle Trail>Backpack Road was amazing, and totally worth the preceding climb.

Ran on both sides of the Bay today for #NationalRunningDay! Got in a second run after work along the #Embarcadero, found this weird bridge thing that fits my head like a hat, and considered swimming to Alcatraz. Decent day overall, 3/5 stars, would rip again. Exhausted after 3 runs in 24 hours, but it was #wharf it. #GlobalRunningDay #GlobalRunningDay2017 #McDonalds

#NationalRunningDay has me up here on top of #IndianRock at the crack of dawn. While there was no real sunrise to speak of today, the solitude was enjoyable, as I'm used to crushing pizza (and beer) up here with the sunset selfie crowd. Still, I can't help but wonder... does this angle make my feet look fat?

Views ain't too shabby in #AnnadelStatePark. Ripped a solid trail run along #BigLakeLoop this morning. Limped to #RussianRiverBrewing only to find an hour long wait... Got a flight of delicious beers at #HenHouseBrewing instead. Nothing left to do today but relax! Perfect Saturday.

Between "Tiger Uppercut" and "Power Glove", #FieldworkBrewing has been killing it with the video game nostalgia. Oh yeah, and the beers are damn good too. Somewhat related rambling: I finally caved and ordered a #RaspberryPi3, and it was delivered today... Once I finish this delicious beer I'm gonna head home, throw on some #HorseTheBand, and build a 16-bit emulation machine!

After over a decade of missing them when they came to town, I finally had a chance to see @APerfectCircle live last night. I've seen Tool and know that Maynard doesn't half-ass his performances... And my expectations were still far surpassed. They put on an incredible show. I've been a huge fan since Mer de Noms was released (17 years ago?!?) and these songs are woven into the fabric of my being. Hearing them live was incredibly cathartic. "A Stranger" in particular hit me right in the feels, as they say. Powerful and emotional from start to finish. Now I'm enjoying a delicious beer and relistening to their second album while getting ready for the next show... @CoheedandCambria at the Fox in Oakland tonight!

A busy day of work kept me off of Instagram until this evening, so I didn't realize it was #NationalBeerDay until 11pm! I received in epic box of beer this week and wasn't sure where to start... Luckily my buddy included a tasting guide with descriptions of each beer. Pretty awesome. Cracked open "Evil Smoosh" by #SoleArtisanAles. This is an interesting one... It has the lactose thing going on with aroma/taste of strawberries and lemon, very light bitterness at the end. I dig it and look forward to trying more from these guys.

I had no idea there was a redwood forest in Oakland... why didn't anyone tell me about this?!? Was hoping to run along the Steam Trail this morning but it was closed due to flooding. Still had a great run today (Orchard Trail kicked my ass) and looking forward to returning when the park reopens some of the longer trails.

Behold, for the first time in nearly a decade, the Lake Berryessa Glory Hole is flowing! This bad boy is over 200 feet deep, and the child in me wants to throw all kinds of stuff into it. I'm fairly certain this is the only family-friendly roadside glory hole in the country.

I love #trailrunning... Turns out the East Bay is a great spot for it! Took this photo yesterday while running through #StrawberryCanyon in the Berkeley Hills. Having this kind of beauty in my backyard does not suck.

Shaky, sweaty shot of Oakland via Lake Merritt. I've been living in the Bay Area for about 6 months now (!?!) and have been to Oakland about a dozen times... the majority of those times have been spent running in circles around this body of water. Note to self: spend more time exploring Oakland.

It was awesome to see #STELLA tonight at The Mezzanine. I've been a huge fan of their unique brand of comedy ever since I ordered a DVD of their skits off the internet way back in high school, circa 2001? These guys were the comedic heroes of my adolescence and are largely to blame for the weirdo that I am today. Their incredible chemistry and timing made me laugh just as hard tonight as it did 15 years ago.

Whenever I deviate from my local running routes here in the East Bay, I find something cool. Ran up into the Berkeley Hills and found some massive boulders overlooking the Bay. Definitely coming back on a clear day to catch a sunset from up here.

Just crushed a hot yoga class at @SweatYoga under the watchful eye of yogi extraordinaire Will (@yogablahblah). The man knows how to work a (sweaty) crowd.

None of the photos that I took at @DominicanHolidaze capture our full crew, but this one has quite a few. Taken during a surprise brunch that kicked off one of the best birthdays that I've ever had, spent with an epic group of friends and incredible music on the beach in the Dominican Republic. #DominicanHolidaze was more than a party; it was a life-affirming weekend that serves as a reminder of how lucky I am to have such great people in my life. </blog>

Solid night of music at @HollywoodBowl, and presumably my last as an LA resident. Saw Dr John and Galactic tonight, and I've seen a lot of other amazing acts here over the years: Herbie Hancock, Nine Inch Nails, Phish, Flying Lotus, Animal Collective, Buddy Guy, Steve Martin, John Fogerty, Underworld, and lots more. I've been extremely privileged to have a world-class venue in my backyard for the past 7 years... Gonna miss this place!

Moving from LA to the Bay Area within the next month or so. Going to miss a lot of things about Santa Monica... Nighttime runs at this track included. I've been lucky to live 2 blocks away from the @SMCEdu track for the past 3 years. I never really thought about it prior to tonight, but I've had a lot of highs and lows here. From glorious, blissed-out training runs during marathon training, to vomit-inducing interval runs after weekends where I had a little too much fun. Coming here at night when no one is around is special, and it's not difficult to zone out and completely forget what you're doing. I've spent countless nights running in circles here and I'm going to miss this place!

Another purdy cake by @wanderlustinlauren. This one's for @badazzdood who is leaving us chumps in LA for the adventure of a lifetime. The cake was part of an awesome send-off celebration on the Redondo Pier - Old Tony‚Äôs, Fire Chiefs, and plenty of hootin' and hollerin‚Äô. #SoLongNick #HeadyCakes #OldTonys #RedondoPier #TheDiscoBiscuits #Magellan #Phish¬†#ThemeFromTheBottom

I haven't touched my car all (earth) week! I've been ripping around town on this shiny green bad boy instead, as part of #EdmundsEarthWeek2016. I've got my @UltimateEars "Roll" bluetooth speaker strapped to the bike and the new @DeftonesBand album on my phone... With this incredible LA weather, what more could you ask for? @EdmundsDotCom #EarthWeek
