The big freeze has hit us in the UK, but it‚Äôs nothing like the proper snow of an #AustrianWinter that we experienced last month. We barely got an inch of snow today, so our hearts are hankering to follow in these footsteps in Saalbach-Hinterglemm. #beastfromtheeast #uksnow18 #Austria #austria_memories

With the ski season in full swing we enjoyed a trip to Austria to discover four of its ski regions. We're not big skiers, but our friend Shelley loves hurtling down all manner of mountains all over the world.

We're back in Austria in the town of Zell am See on Lake Zell for a little spa break before hitting the Christmas markets in Innsbruck. We were last here in April when the lake looked just a little more spring like than it does right now. As you can see, there was still a little snow on the mountains even then.

This photo was taken on our last trip to Innsbruck. Well closeby, it‚Äôs at Swarovski Kristalwelten near the city and home to glittering artworks, some of which are by members of the glitterati too. As we head back to Innsbruck today to wander its Christmas markets and enjoy one of Austria‚Äôs quirkiest seasonal traditions (don‚Äôt miss our IG stories tomorrow), this cristal-art phrase makes us think of the season we‚Äôre in. Its not only the season of goodwill, but that of grab the world by the horns and say yes to all and every invitation you receive. Go on - you can make up for your excesses in January!

It's fascinating how much religious sites vary in shape, colour, decoration and more around the world. Nhan Tower in the Ph√∫ Y√™n province of Vietnam was built by the ancient Cham people in the 12th century.

This is a building we could play in for hours, hiding behind its lace framed windows and running through its archway. Zaragoza's Arch of the Dean is, alongside the cathedral, one of the most emblematic landmarks in the city. It was built in 1293 when the Dean wanted an arch that connected the cathedral to his new home. As the cathedral is only a few hundred yards away he sounds just a wee bit lazy to us! #SpainByTrain

Autumn colours are golden, rust red and orange. But I enjoyed going green and immersing myself into the Royal Botanical Gardens in Madrid. Located in the heart of the city next to the Prado Museum, it is home to around 90,000 plants and flowers, and 1,500 trees, and is a lovely place to spend an afternoon away from the rush of the city's streets. #SpainbyTrain

Enter the arena... Tarragona's Roman amphitheatre is one of its many great Roman treasures. Built at the end of 1st century BC, it could hold up to 14,000 spectators. In its day, it was the scene of fights between gladiators (who would also take on wild beasts), as well as public executions. Think we'd rather stay out of there! #SpainByTrain

The light through the Dark Hedges. This Game of Thrones location refused to show us its legendary aura on the day we visited, preferring to weave sunshine through the shadows instead of showing us the dark, moody mist seen in the show. But it was still a sight to behold. #LoveNI

There's nothing like enveloping yourself in a place. And when a city fits you as well as Seville did me, you just have to paint the town red. Plaza de Espa√±a in Parque de Mar√≠a Luisa was built in 1928 for the Ibero-American Exposition World's Fair to showcase Spain's industry and technology exhibits. It's a surprising mix of Art Deco, mock Mudejar, and¬†Neo-Mudejar (Moorish) styles, with half a mile of tiled fountains, pavilions, ponds, and gorgeous tiled benches. #SpainByTrain üì∑ @barsandspas

A moment of calm... Seville's Alc√°zar Palace is popular. So popular that I didn't think I'd see a scene like this, where a couple were able to pause in its gardens. The palace is beautiful and changes at turns from its Moorish patios, to landscaped gardens, murals and artworks, and settings Game of Thrones fans will recognise (yes, it really is Dorne). The Palace is well worth seeing and will need at least 2-3 hours to explore. Just try to plan your visit for quieter periods to make the most of it. #SpainByTrain

Pink light hitting Zaragoza's cathedral. It is said to be the first¬†church dedicated to the Virgin Mary under her title,¬†Our Lady of the Pillar. It is also home to a dramatic fresco in its dome,¬†The Queen of Martyrs,¬†by romantic painter Francisco Goya. #SpainbyTrain

‚ÄúEvery person needs to take one day away.¬†A day in which one consciously separates the past from the future... Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for.¬†Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us.‚Äù Maya Angelou likely didn't have a day wandering Madrid's parks in mind when she wrote this. But this scene made me think of this quote. Luxury is often viewed as coming in the shape of things or indulgences, but time can be one luxury we all could enjoy more of. Train travel can give us that time. The irony of our #SpainbyTrain journey to four Spanish cities in four days on @renfe's high-speed trains is that it allowed us more time in each city. But train travel can also equate to slow travel. And, if unlike us you're not completing some wild city break challenge, we'd recommend you be good to yourself - take time to enjoy the journey as well as the destination.

To me, Seville is red. Passionate, fiery, scarlet, characterised by the pulse of flamenco and the heat of the intense Andalucian sun. So how better than to show your affinity with a place than to paint it red? And this doorway at the Alcazar Palace was an obvious choice for a photo. Seriously, who could resist it? #SpainbyTrain

There's little better than losing the map and losing yourself in a city. Tarragona was our first stop of our #SpainbyTrain trip, where we visited four cities in four days on Spain's AVE high-speed trains. The beauty of history-rich Tarragona is that it's small enough to see much of it in a day and we loved losing ourselves in its winding streets. #spainbytrain

When you wander a city, when you look up you can spot fortunate finds. This curiosity in Tarragona was painted by local artist, Carlos Arola in 1995. It imitates a 19th century facade and was painted in the "trompe l'oeil" style - a technique which aims to deceive the eye through the use of light, shade and perspective. It creates a sense of reality with objects, characters and settings appearing real to the casual observer. #SpainbyTrain

"All experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move," Alfred Lord Tennyson. || I've always loved archways - the way they can transform a perspective on a building, shaped by light before, within and beyond them. Given the Romans and Moors penchant for a little curvature to buildings in the cities I travelled through in Spain recently, you can expect a few more photos of them here. This is another from Aljafer√≠a¬†Palace in Zaragoza. #spainbytrain

Fancy climbing a mushroom? In Seville it's a possibility. This is Las Setas - said to be the world's largest wooden structure since it opened in 2011. It consists of six¬†parasols¬†in the form of giant mushrooms with a design inspired by the vaults of Seville¬†Cathedral¬†and the¬†ficus trees¬†in the nearby Plaza de Cristo de Burgos. It's a pretty cool bit of built environment art and has excellent views of the whole city. It's also a fun place to spend an hour or so. üì∑ @bordersofadventure #spainbytrain

Zaragoza isn't all about modern architecture - far from it. These intricate arches are the Aljafer√≠a¬†Palace, the most northerly Moorish palace in Europe. Dating back to the 11th century there's much for the history lover, and also plenty to entice architecture fans. It really is the jewel in Zaragoza's dazzling crown. #SpainbyTrain

Zaragoza struck me as Spain's capital of sculpture. Not only is it home to modern works out at its super cool, Zaha Hadid designed Bridge Pavilion at its Expo centre to the city centre full of works of art. Though it should be no surprise - this is the city of romantic artist Goya. Pictured here is Fuente de la Hispanidad, erected in the early 1990s by architect Ricardo Uson Garc√≠a and has a fountain of water rushing over the outline of South America. #SpainbyTrain

Why go on a bike or walking tour of a city when you can explore by classic car? We recently made good use of Spain‚Äôs high-speed rail network to visit four of its cities in four days. So we arrived in Madrid by the AVE fast train, but soon took to four wheels - a vintage Seat 600 - to scoot around the city sights.

There are some hotels you just never want to leave. As we opened the doors to our pool villa at Banyan Tree Phuket and stepped out into our private pool, it was tempting to make like mangroves - shooting out roots into the water to cling to our perfect luxury surrounds. But as much as we love amazing accommodation - and every one of the hotels we checked into on our Abercrombie & Kent trip was just that - we‚Äôre not ones to stay put for long. Not when there is the vibrancy of Thailand to embrace anyway. And with that, don‚Äôt miss our latest challenge video - cooking Thai food at the incredible Wildflower Home - an A&K Philanthropy project which we were honoured to visit the day before travelling down to Phuket from Chiang Mai. We love that A&K don‚Äôt only take you to beautiful places, but bring you closer to the local culture, and give back - supporting community projects around the world. Luxury travel can be rather self indulgent - and there‚Äôs nothing at all wrong with self care and pampering. But Wildflower Home, which helps vulnerable women and families reestablish themselves, revealed just how much of an impact we can have on the lives of others with a little giving. Not just money, but skills, time, and importantly, love. See more in our profile link. #DiscoverThailand

Flowers can mean so much. They can be a gift, a treat to self, a memorial, and much more. In Buddhist cultures they are an offering, and as you must give Buddha the very best that you have, you must never smell the flowers first. Luckily my @abercrombiekent guide, Sarah, saved me from a faux pas at a temple. So glad for her inside knowledge, and I still enjoyed the flowers from afar. #DiscoverThailand

Pause and absorb the transformation... All too often you hear travellers say ‚ÄúX destination isn‚Äôt the same since I first visited 25 years ago‚Äù. Well, no. it won‚Äôt be. Chiang Mai has changed so much since we first visited 12 years ago. There‚Äôs coffee culture (and the coffee is great!), kitsch and cool restaurants and so much more. We found most of the above here at 137 Pillars House. There was perfect chill in its spa, we ate possibly our best meal (of many, many great ones) in its restaurant, and secreted ourselves away in the luxury of our colonial-styled suite. Not that we needed to hide away from the rush of the city - despite the changes, Chiang Mai is still blissfully relaxed and our kind of place. #DiscoverThailand

There are many traditional crafts in Thailand including the art of umbrella making. In the north of the country in Chiang Mai, this is delivered on daily at Bor Sang Umbrella Village, where Terry learned how to craft his very own umbrella. They make umbrellas in paper and of doubled cotton. But one thing common to each of them is the incredible array of colours and designs they are available in.

In busy cities it can be hard to find areas of solace. But wherever you go in Thailand - from its villages to heaving metropolises - its temples are a place to pause and reflect, letting the modern world around you evaporate. We loved wandering around temples in Thailand‚Äôs second city, Chiang Mai. They never under deliver on intricate architecture, and sheer colour. #DiscoverThailand #AmazingThailand

The other day we shared a photo of the main pagoda at Wat Arun - here‚Äôs a close up. We love the porcelain plates that cover it (see the rose shapes bottom left and right - yes, they‚Äôre plates) and the characters that adorn it. But have to confess to almost not recognising the temple on this visit. It was restored from 2013 to 2017, and lime plaster replaced cement used during earlier restorations. As a result the restoration drew criticism for giving the temple a new appearance, which seemed white-washed. Thailand‚Äôs Fine Arts Department though says it was carefully restored to reflect the temple's original look. So it would seem it was gleaming white all along. #DiscoverThailand #AmazingThailand

Thailand is one of the countries that seems most at peace with its mix of religions and the church of Santa Cruz and the district it serves is evidence of this. The Portuguese Catholic church was first built in 1770, and today the church and neighbouring school are frequented by Catholics, in what is a predominantly Buddhist country. It sits on the banks of the Chao Praya River, in Kudichin, and the area took its name from the church which was at one time called Kudi Jeen meaning Chinese church after the shape of the second one built on the site. And the Portuguese impact on Kudichin doesn‚Äôt end there. You can still buy ‚ÄúPortuguese cakes‚Äù - made with rice flour and no butter - in the streets that wind away from the river. #DiscoverThailand

Wat Arun is one of the most famous sights in Bangkok and one of our favourite landmarks. By day it‚Äôs almost dazzlingly bright white in the intense sunshine. By night it dons a shimmer of golden light. But on a tour of Thonburi, our @abercrombiekent guides, Sarah & Joey gave us a very different perspective on this area as well as the temple. There are in fact many temples in the area. Few with the porcelain plates and cups that adorn Wat Arun (relics of a Chinese ship that sunk near the city), but they are equally as spectacular. #DiscoverThailand

If you think the taxidermy behind me looks wild, wait till you see my dinner! Insects in the Backyard is a fine dining insect restaurant, with an eclectic interior *and* menu. It was here that I faced my nemesis (you can likely tell from the look on my face) - a meal of five insect-based dishes. You see I‚Äôm terrified of most insects, and even seeing them lying there dead would leave me petrified, least of all eating them. The meal included fried grasshoppers, scallops topped with bamboo caterpillars, sea bass with green queen ants and baby ants in the sauce (which I had to admit was surprisingly delicious), pesto pasta topped with fried crickets (they taste smokey like bacon), and orange Crepe Suzette with silkworm ice cream. Chef Mai Thitiwat says insects are future food because they‚Äôre sustainable, an excellent source of protein and due to a predicted swell in the Earth‚Äôs population we‚Äôll be looking for new food sources. But what do you think? Would you be tempted to give them a go? See the video we made of this and other eating experiences in Bangkok for @abercrombiekent on the link in our profile. #DiscoverThailand

Hello from Thailand, where we‚Äôve been for the past few days. We‚Äôve been on a dizzying schedule including daily challenges, many of which have taken us closer to the true heart and nature of Thailand. This is our seventh visit to Thailand - it‚Äôs one of our favourite countries - and yet on this project sponsored by @abercrombiekent we have discovered aspects to it that we‚Äôve never experienced before. We‚Äôve explored Bangkok beyond the touristy places to see real life in the likes of Kudichin - a former Portuguese enclave. However, Thailand is also a haven for luxury travellers and we‚Äôre staying in hotels which always deliver on luxury. This is the Author‚Äôs Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok. Not only does it ooze old world style, but reflects the history of the 140-year-old hotel as a whole. It celebrates this history with rooms named after former guests, Somerset Maugham, Joseph Conrad and Noel Coward. We‚Äôre doing a series of videos, Facebook Lives and more so check #DiscoverThailand to see what we‚Äôre up to.

Ooh Tirol! We love your architecture, your A-frames, pointy roofs, window boxes and all of that colour - and this is the scene in a more ‚Äúurban‚Äù location - the town of Kufstein. Nonetheless, you make the world a pretty place. #feelaustria #visittirol

From the beach-loving cows of Vietnam yesterday, we‚Äôre moving on to the well-dressed cows of Austria. This bonny bovine is all dressed up for the Almabtrieb, or Cattle Drive. Tis the season in Austria right now as winter is on its way and therefore time for farmers to bring their herds down from the mountains. The Almabtrieb is celebrated with a colourful festival, in towns like Kufstein, in Tirol, where townsfolk gathered - many in traditional costumes - for folk music, tasty local delicacies, and of course, to see the decorated cows come home. Would you believe the headdresses, some featuring religious idols, are all handmade? #Kufstein #stskitzbuehel

Let's go through the door, enter in and explore... . Culture is such an all encompassing, yet shifting concept, but I love every part of exploring a new culture. Culture doesn't live in museums for me. But it's in the religious symbols at churches and temples, it's in the  people I meet and what I learn about the things that are important to them. And in the food, drink, sights, sounds and smells of a place. üì∑ @glographics . . üì£TELL US: What cool cultures have you discovered around the world, and what fascinated you most about them? üì£

When you discover a church in your favourite colour it could lead to a religious conversion. Though I'm not entirely sure the Catholics would have me. But it was a surprise to come across this beauty in the middle of Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam. It's another relic of the city's French colonial past and was built in the 1880s.

Sometimes you just want to get away from it all. And when we landed in Ph√∫ Y√™n province in the middle of Vietnam's coast we couldn't think of a better place to escape. Ph√∫ Y√™n is still pretty underdeveloped, frequented more by local travellers than hoards from around the world. And it has some pretty cool natural attractions, like this, Da Dia Reef, where volcanic lava tumbling into the sea millions of years ago left it with hexagonal rock formations, not unlike the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland (compare it to the post in my feed from Ireland just a few weeks ago). üì∑ @tourdelust

This is Ho Chi Minh City - a modern cityscape, steeped in Asian culture but with a French colonial style. This is a postcard I bought to send home to a friend (yes, we still send the one to a young daughter of friends of ours who puts the cards onto a giant map). What's really special about it though is the building I bought it in. Ho Chi Minh's post office was designed by French architect Marie-Alfred Foulhoux (though is often credited wrongly to Gustave Eiffel). It was his final work and widely regarded as his greatest. As you can see, it's still very much in use as a post office today, but it comes with standout architecture, beautiful tiled floors, and a portrait of Uncle Ho, just in case all this French style made you forget where you really were.

With this many incense coils we can almost smell the woody, sweet aromas that curl on smoky fingers through the air and take us right back to Ba Thien Hau Temple in Ho Chi Minh City. I'd never seen such large incense coils and it was just one of many distinct features of this Buddhist temple that I really enjoyed.

Loved the colours of these Chinese style lanterns hanging from a tree at twilight at B√¨nh Qu·ªõi in Ho Chi Minh City.

Splashes of red and a battalion of gold greet visitors to Ch√πa Nghƒ©a An. The temple in Ho Chi Minh's Chinatown is a mix of incredible colour and Buddhist symbols. It was a pleasure to visit and should be on the list of everyone who goes to the city. It's also next to a school so you may come across lots of ridiculously cute children when you visit.

This may look like a scene from a European city, but this is Notre Dame Cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Dating back to the French colonial era, the Roman and Gothic styled cathedral highlights the mix of religions in the country. It also has some interesting stories to it. In 2005, the Virgin Mary statue in front of it was reported to have shed tears from its right eye, attracting thousands of people.

When warm evening light bathes Ho Chi Minh's temples in light. This is from Ch√πa Nghƒ©a An, a temple in Chinatown where @darlingescapes and I fell in love with this doorway. The temples offer a moment for reflection in the cacophony of the city, but I really fell for their architecture, a theme I'll be coming back to in more photos from HCMC. üì£ TELL US: Terry always says he "loves a good door", so I knew instantly he'd have appreciated this one. How many door fans are there out there?üì£

These are perhaps the biggest lily pads I've ever seen in my life! Meanwhile, I'm perched on the edge of one of the most rickety bamboo bridges I've ever seen in my life. This area of Ho Chi Minh, B√¨nh Qu·ªõi, is a tourist village just outside the city. But let that put the fear of Disney into you! B√¨nh Qu·ªõi has lush gardens with creeks, coconut trees and thatched cottages, offering up a view of days gone by in the Mekong Delta¬†region. And plenty of great photo opportunities as well as traditional southern Vietnamese food, and break from the fast paced city. üì∑ @veerabianca

There are certain floor tiles that are just made for Instagramming! ;-) We loved these tiles at Ba Thien Hau Temple in Ho Chi Minh's Chinatown. The temple of the Chinese¬†sea goddess¬†Mazu. On the 23rd day of the third month of the¬†Vietnamese lunar calendar, the idol of Mazu is removed from its altar and paraded through Chinatown.¬†Meanwhile, the temple's large bronze bell, which dates back to 1830, is rung whenever large donations are made.

Who needs a drone when you're in the heady nation of San Marino? This photo was taken from the Guaita Tower, one of the three towers that dominates the landscape of the independent republic, which sits in the middle of Italy. Originally constructed in the 11th century, the Guaita Tower is an ideal place to capture the beauty of another of it's landmarks - the Cesta Tower, here, and this spectacular, mountainous state. #TheRidersLand

From the road runners of Italy to the scooters of Vietnam. While Terry was at the Moto GP in San Marino, I've been in Ho Chi Minh attending @itehcmc and discovering one of Asia's hottest cities. The first thing you notice about HCMC is the traffic, but this is not a city where cars choke the roads. You're more likely to see five lanes of motorbikes and mopeds next to one lane of everything else - cars, buses, and trucks because here, two wheels rule the road. The driving is chaotic - I can't say I spotted many rules to the road being observed - motorbikes and mopeds even mount the pavement to get a few seconds advantage on the main throng of traffic. Crossing the road too is erm... exhilarating - the bikes stop for no-one but time their manoeuvres around you. But somehow in the race to get through the city there seemed remarkably few accidents - I put this down to the slowish speed of the traffic. #vibranthochiminh

Check out my wheels! This Ape Car tour of Rimini took in some of its great places to eat Piadina - a thin Italian flatbread filled with an array of local delicacies (from Parma ham to mortadella and salumi to Parmesan cheese - all things for which the Emilia Romagna region is famous). But it's also blessed with dramatic views and we regularly stopped to take in the wonderful countryside Rimini is fortunate to be surrounded by. I mean, you wouldn't pass that up would you? #inEmiliaRomagna #TheRidersLand

The colourful, vibrant uniform of the guards at the Palazzo Pubblico, make them really stand out in this already colourful nation. Built between 1184 and 1894, the¬†Palazzo Public is the seat of government in San Marino, and is a characterful building inside and out. The changing of the guard is a major attraction. #SanMarino #TheRidersLand

We're in Italy and San Marino - the tiny nation famous for a few things, including being the home of Moto GP. But before we get off to the races we explored Roman Rimini where we came across the¬†Bridge of Augustus. This¬†2,000-year-old¬†bridge is a wonderful piece of history whose story could have ended but for the whim of a general. The bridge was supposed to be¬†destroyed by the retreating German army in the¬†Battle of Rimini, in 1944,¬†but the general in charge claimed it had been blown up, but thankfully it never was. #inEmiliaRomagna #TheRidersLand

This view looks all the better once you've managed to make your way over the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge in Northern Ireland. Before that you may struggle to take in the surrounding sights as you're faced with a 100 foot drop beneath your feet and the bridge, down to the sea below.

To understand where a place is going in the future, you need to get to grips with its past. And Belfast is a perfect example of this. Yes, this is a city that's had its troubles, but the divisions of the past are now memorialised on the streets that most represented the challenges of two communities with different political views. This one, on the Falls Road (a traditionally Republican area) grabbed my attention. Today, the tradition of painting murals here and also on the traditionally Unionist Shankhill Road to communicate news and thinking on the times has been replaced with memorials and works of art. Nearly 20 years after the Peace Process, Belfast is a positive, friendly, exciting city - its people united in working together to deliver a warm welcome to visitors. As our guide, Dee told us, "In our family, we don't care who you are, as long as you're good looking". And Belfast is certainly a fun and great looking city. #LoveBelfast

When you visit the Dark Hedges you have to bring your own cape and sword, no? One of the most famous Games of Thrones locations, it begs that you ham it up Westeros style. From the Dothraki Sea to the Iron Islands, Winterfell, Dorne, The Twins, Renly‚Äôs Camp, the Riverlands, Stormlands, Dragonstone and more - Northern Ireland has created the backdrop to many a scene. But if there is one place that has become truly evocative for fans of the show it‚Äôs the eerie twists and turns of the beech trees on Bregagh Road. The avenue of around 150 trees were planted by the wealthy owner of Gracehill House in about 1775 to create an impressive approach to his estate. Today the street is a busy one, so you have to carefully time your photography in between coach loads of visitors, but it‚Äôs worth it to see this gorgeous avenue and other GoT locations. Northern Ireland lets you go way beyond the Wall to get a real life taste of the mystical lands of the world‚Äôs favourite television show. #LoveNI #LoveBelfast

Don't let the blue skies fool you - Winter Is Here, because this, Game of Thrones fans, is the North. Northern Ireland's film industry is booming, not least because perhaps the world's most popular TV show which has used its historic landmarks and mystical landscapes as locations throughout. Winterfell, the Crossing at the Twins (scene of the infamous Red Wedding) pictured here, and more, are at Castle Ward. The 17th century site offers a whole Game of Thrones experience where you can dress like Starks, learn archery and hang out with dire wolves. #LoveNI #LoveBelfast

One of the things we love about Croatia is its smaller islands that are perfect for a real get away from it all escape. The island of ≈†olta is a great example - a tiny dot in the Adriatic where time slows to a peaceful plod.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/542a2f0c77da2893007d13f6e66e0331/5BCF845C/t51.2885-15/e35/20590267_114492412543616_1797630558554030080_n.jpg
We travel A LOT so it's rare that we enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Travel generally equals a lot of hassle these days. But when we visit Croatia's islands we enjoy the whole experience from landing at the airport to getting to our island escape. From Split for example, it's just 40 minute taxi to the ferry terminal and then the Adriatic is before you, offering up any number of jewels to visit. And the ferry journey is pleasant too. Some are fast - a catamaran scooting across the sea, but we like to take the slow boat, unwind with a local beer and take in views like these.

We enjoyed taking you to Australia's coast last week so thought we'd wend and wind our way around it for just a little longer, and take in Mornington Peninsula's beach huts. We loved this region of Victoria. But then what's not to love!? It has a stellar collecfion of vineyards with plenty of cellar doors to stop at for tastings. And where there's wine, there's always great food. Plus Mornington Peninsula is a region of blooming beautiful gardens, and of course, plenty of beaches for lazy afternoons.

Could this be one of the most famous views on Australia's coast? The Twelve Apostles is one of the destinations in Australia that has people travelling thousands of miles to see. And after catching them up close and from above on a helicopter tour, I can't blame them! It's just a three hour drive from Melbourne so many people visit in a day. But there's so much else to see out on the Great Ocean Road it's well worth taking a few days or even a week to drive it.

Australia's coast isn't all deserted white beaches. Sydney is built on the water with Sydneysiders living within a whiff of fresh, sea air and ferries traversing its harboursides each and every day.

Cape Otway lighthouse is said to be the most important in Australia. It is the oldest surviving lighthouse in the country and has been beaming its light across the Bass Strait and Southern Ocean since 1848. For many thousands of 19th century migrants who spent months travelling by ship to Australia, Cape Otway was their first sighting of land after leaving Europe.

It may be winter down under in Australia, but we find there's never a bad time to celebrate the country's vast and spectacular coast. So all this week that's just what we'll be doing. This is Whitehaven Beach in the you-must-visit destination of the Whitsundays, near Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. üì£ TELL US: What's your favourite Aussie beach? üì£

Yelloh! Village in Saint-Emilion offers guests a woodland hideaway to retreat to in the glorious French countryside. Surrounded by vineyards stretching as far as the eye can see, the campsite offers traditional pitches, luxury woodland cottages and this luxurious houseboat on the lake. No matter what accommodation option you choose, you'll soon find yourself easing into the relaxed French lifestyle here, in between pool time, sailing on the lake, and sampling Yelloh's extensive selection of wines produced in the surrounding Bordeaux region. Read all about it on the link in our profile.

Saint Emilion's Collegiate Church and its cloisters are hard to miss. The scale of the monument reflects the importance of religion in this wine growing community of France's Bordeaux region. Construction started in 1110 and the core of the church was transformed in the gothic style, between the 13th and 15th centuries. The church and cloister are undoubtedly impressive, and the silence is a welcoming feel, a chance to reflect and let your senses take over. #saintemilion

Cadene's House and Gate is the last half-timbered house which remains in the historic village of Saint-Emilion, France. Its carved facade dates back to the 16th century, while the foundations are believed to be much older. Inside, the house still features an impressive polygonal tower and the original spiral staircase. The gate was once the inside gate to the city, and it is believed that it socially separated the noble population of the upper town from the more modest community in the lower part of Saint-Emilion. For a walk back in time, spend an afternoon soaking up the sights of the charming medieval village - both above and below ground - you won't be disappointed.

The market square of Saint-Emilion in southwest France, was once a meeting point for pilgrims who came in search of Emilion, a Benedictine monk who could perform miracles as legend has it. This charming medieval village is worthy of note as it is recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site and home to 17 historic monuments. Today, the square bustles with restaurants and shops. After a tour of the village, chill out with a glass of one of the region's finest wines and simply watch the world go by.

Sunny days in Saint-Emilion, in the Bordeaux region of south-west France. This charming medieval village offers history, culture, wine and gastronomy in equal measure. The view of the monolithic church and bel tower is perhaps the most famous monuments of them all. Built between the 12th and 15th centuries, the bell tower weighs 4,500 tonnes - the equivalent of 750 elephants. Mighty in view and by nature, the church is the widest monolithic church in Europe. And after savouring these views from the Kings Keep, I soon descended to savour some of the local fruity wines.

This is one of the more unusual accommodations we came across in Galicia in Spain. But this 200-year-old grain store (one of the countless old stores dotted around the region's vineyards), has been converted into a hotel room at Made in Fof√†n. It's historic, but not the quirkiest of its rooms. For that, you'll have to stay tuned for a few more days... #inGalicia #OSalnes

Welcome to Cambados, in Galicia, Spain, this year's European City of Wine. It's no small boast for a small city, but Cambados is in the Rias Baixas wine region so famous for Albari√±o wine. We had a great time there discovering Gil Armada winery at Pazo de Fefi√±√°ns - a 17th century palace with its own vineyards in the heart of the city. We had a fantastic lunch at Michelin-starred Yayo Daporta, and even discovered where Galicia's tasty seafood comes from by joining local women cockling on the beach. So as aromatic and characterful as the area's wine is, Cambados has even more flavour for travellers. üì£TELL US: we ate a lot of seafood in Galicia, but this was our first time cockling. Have you ever had close encounters with your food before it hit your plate? Have you gathered your grub? üì£ #inGalicia #OSalnes

Nature is a powerful force in Galicia, Spain. Not only is the Rias Baixas region blessed with great conditions for growing delicious Albari√±o grapes for wine, this same soil and climate are also ideal for other plants, like camellias that do so well there and have a whole route dedicated to them which you can tour. The camellias weren't in flower when we visited but it didn't stop us enjoying the gardens at Pazo de Rubianes and taking shade from the hot afternoon sun under these gorgeous old trees. #inGalicia #OSalnes

We're in the Rias Baixas wine region of Galicia, Spain, and naturally, the vineyards bursting with aromatic Albari√±o grapes are the star attraction. But who could resist a walk along Galicia's crocheted coastline. This is Pedras Negras where granite boulders hold back the Atlantic Ocean from invading the land. It's a beautiful place, especially for a sunset walk. TELL US: would you like to wander this path with us? #inGalicia #OSalnes

The Canadian Journeys exhibit at the Canadian Museum for Hunan Rights in Winnipeg charts the steps and missteps which were taken in securing better rights for the nation. to greater rights for everyone in Canada. The largest exhibit within the museum, the story is reflected through real life experiences such as the story of school teacher Viola Desmond who was subjected to segregation in 1946. The journey covers subjects from language and democratic rights to freedom of conscience and freedom from discrimination all featured through a 29 metre digital canvas and individual story stations. The museum is well curated and makes a conscious effort not to group themes by subject or chronologically within exhibits so that visitors can really immerse themselves in the variety of content. Definitely not your average museum, you could while away hours here in discovering what human rights are and how they have affected people and inspired change across the past, present and future.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0b387d8e83e597c1bcd0d084cd589a31/5BD4F869/t51.2885-15/e35/18949663_339904913092874_3813689830794067968_n.jpg
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg completely threw out of the water the misconceptions I had about museums. A dream of the late philanthropist Israel Asper, the winning architecture design was carefully planned and considered in order to reflect the contrasting Canadian landscapes. The front incorporates the wings of a dove enveloping the building, the four root sections laden in prairie grass are designed to represent all humans are children of the earth and the glass frontage resembles the sky and clouds. Lastly the Tower of Hope represents the iconic glaciers that grace the landscape. Unsurprisingly it's hard to miss in The Forks area of downtown and inside its complex geometrical design and spaces which take you from dark to light provide an immersive journey - not only through the forward thinking exhibits, but your surroundings too. With seven floors of interactive exhibits which look at the lives and beliefs of various people in society as well as a walk through some iconic historical events, rather than the sombre experience I was expecting, it actually taught me to see things with a different perspective and how actions are made through choices.

After a much needed thermal spa session at Thermea - a Nordic Spa in Winnipeg, Manitoba, I enjoyed a four course wine pairing menu at onsite bistro, Resto. This strawberry and walnut salad was simply divine and I could smell the sweet aromas of the strawberries before the dish even landed on the table. Paired with a lively prosecco, the sweet and nutty flavours made for a sumptuous meal. Who knew a salad could be so delicious! And all complemented of course my the wonderful Canadian hospitality - great service and a fantastic sundown spa and savour experience.

The Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg is something of a puzzle with mysteries and optical illusions. On a tour I discovered some of the features of the building which have been created according to the Hermetic Code. It unlocks the magic and mystery inside this intriguing structure from hidden inscriptions to numerological codes. And it left me puzzled and amazed at the level of detail in just one building. A must visit in Winnipeg for sure!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1323e148b1c8c1d4fc4c235965b92aab/5BE194F8/t51.2885-15/e35/18879815_758546974319508_6109798369645821952_n.jpg
While touring Winnipeg's lively Exchange District this building immediately stood out to me - not just because it towers high above the rest of the block but its unique design and details on its facade. Built between 1903 and 1904, it was originally the Union Bank Building and fast forward to today, it is now western Canada's oldest skyscraper. Now used to train culinary students, Jane's - the culinary school's restaurant, still contains some of the original features including marble once used for the banker's counters. I just love the stories attached to Winnipeg's heritage buildings. #explorecanada #mycanadianaffair #experiencetransat

Breakfast is served at the Alt Hotel Winnipeg - a laid back and affordable luxury option in the city's sports district. With contemporary features such as this quirky and colourful wall art installation, unusually the hotel offers a flat rate year round, allowing even more luxury when events are on in the city. And with no check out time and comfortable beds for a great night's slumber - I love the fact that I can rest and relax here in Winnipeg without the hefty price tags! And it's only ten minutes from the airport so it's ideal for after a long flight. #ExploreCanada #mycanadianaffair

The Dancing Horses of Jerez is a spectacular show of balletic beauty. There‚Äôs a swish of white as a horse and it‚Äôs smartly suited rider form a determined arc to the right, passing within inches of another, curving to the left as they both thunder to the front of the arena. Sailing through a sharp bend they tip-toe, crossing their legs one in front of the other like prima ballerinas performing a breezy allegro. Then they turn, and with hypnotic grace, glide into another formation. It's a lesser-known side of Andalusian culture, but something you shouldn't miss.

There are a few destinations in the world that really have an otherworldly feel to them. Lanzarote in Spain, with its lava-carved landscapes, is one of them. It has so many unique natural features - take its wine growing region La Geria, where single vines grow in semi-circular lava stone pits, and the chiselled beauty of its volcanic heart. This is the view from its north coast, overlooking the island of La Graciosa, from one of many great C√©sar Manrique works (the artist was skilled in mixing the built and natural environments in his work). The Mirador del R√≠o needs to be seen to be truly absorbed though - it is 360-degrees of coastal drama.

Sometimes when we travel it can be the big ticket locations that pull us in. We can even journey for miles to see the main attraction. And then we discover something equally (or sometimes) more spectacular next door. This is Loch Ard Gorge, right around the coast from the 12 Apostles, in Victoria, Australia. It's one of the most gorgeous bays, but with a sad story revealing the mayhem nature can cause. It is named after¬†a¬†ship that sunk off its coast in 1878. Fifty two people died in¬†the shipwreck, the only survivors being Eva Carmichael and Tom Pearce, whose families still live in the region today. üì£ TELL US: where in the world will we find the overlooked sights - something around the corner from the main attraction that pulls in all the visitors, but is as good as/better that an the big draw? üì£

Sail away with us and into the tranquility of Menorca. We can forget just how much we love it - it's so close, so within reach, it doesn't always seem that exotic. But moments after dropping anchor there we're reminded, as Menorca wraps us in its peaceful embrace. And with many secluded beaches, and even some secreted away from the world behind a craggy coast, it's ideal for escape artists. It's also perfect for a taste of real Spain - as something of a late starter with tourism development, Menorca is low-rise and authentically Spanish.

Gosh, Austria's mountains put greenery in our hearts and fresh air in our lungs. This is the road to Lech from the Bregenzerwald, in the western region of Vorarlberg. The hills may be alive with the sound of music in a certain other region of the country, but in the lofty, mountainous reaches of Vorarlberg its the sound of silence, only broken by the occasional chime of cowbells as the herd heads home to be milked each day.

Don't know about you but after a long old day we're thinking it's definitely wine o'clock! Today's tipple is brought to us by Jordan's Wines, a vineyard we visited a couple of years back in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Stellenbosch is a place of creature comforts and delicious delights, it's where cellar doors are propped open in welcome, and great wine is consumed liberally.

Granada's Alhambra Palace is one of Spain's Moorish masterpieces. Starting as a small fortress  back in 889 AD, it is now one of Andalusia's largest and most popular Moorish sites. We love its features - the Generalife with its perfectly landscaped gardens and the endless geometric shapes and patterns in tiles walls and carved into stone. It's an unmissable place in which to discover some of Spain's history. One tip though - Granada gets hot, hot, hot in summer, so go now, or leave a visit until the autumn.

We were married in Thailand 10 whole years ago this week. My, time goes quickly!! Here's pictures from our big day. Have to admit it was a pretty cool day, but with all that Thai sunshine, 22 of our nearest and dearest coming over with us, monks to bless our union, Buddhist ceremonies, a sunset cruise off the coast of Phuket, a ladyboy cabaret and a party late into the night it was bound to be memorable. Since our own destination wedding we recommend it to every couple we know, and go to every one we're invited to. It's such a different experience from the norm, and if you love to travel as much as we do, it's a no brainer. It can also be a much more economical option with the average cost of a UK wedding now upwards of ¬£25,000. We spent our anniversary in another of our favourite countries - Austria, having some serious alpine spa RnR. TELL US: did you marry abroad? Or have you been to a destination wedding?

There are now only eight limestone stacks making up the 12 Apostles, in Australia, the others have collapsed into the sea or given in to centuries of erosion. But they're still pretty spectacular, especially when viewed up close (well about as close as you can get) from a helicopter.

Working in travel you often try to avoid the obvious and some people even denigrate the landmarks others travel thousands of miles to see. But sometimes there's nothing like seeing one of the world's most famous landmarks for the first time.

"I stayed up all night wondering where the sun had gone. And then it dawned on me..." Just spotted this anonymous quote on the Tube in London. Love it because it says so much in so few words, and can be taken in many ways. Worry less. Enjoy more.

Welcome to the jubilant jaune (yes, that's yellow) of @veuveclicquot's cellars. Home to 100 million bottles of champagne - seriously, there is a heaven!! Their cellars are part of the Champagne region's UNESCO World Heritage Sites as they are located in the mile upon mile of underground chalk quarries. Hewn out by the Romans they have served as hideaways for smugglers, hideouts and hospitals during the Second World War and now house millions of champagne bottles as they mature across the region. The steps here are a walk through Veuve Clicquot's history - each year on a step represents one of the house's vintage years. #bgtwvisitlachampagne #VisitFrenchWine

Ooh Reims - you beauty! Loving being back in Champagne, and not just for the fantastic bubbly. Reims cathedral is certainly worthy of a visit, but last time we were here we didn't see it at night, so walking around the corner and seeing it in all its glory this evening was a nice welcome back. Read more about Reims and tastings at Bollinger and elsewhere in the region on the link in our profile. #bgtwvisitlachampagne #VisitFrenchWine

What's your impression of Finland? Is it a frozen landscape lauded over by ice maidens? Trendy, design-forward cities like Helsinki? Or the land of Santa Claus and Aurora Borealis? For us it's an intoxicating wintry wilderness and a land of magical light. This is from Kultaranta Resort in the coastal town (and summer royal residence) of Naantali. #visitnaantali #nbefinland

Like a tropical wallpaper pattern come to life, these Caribbean flamingoes live in the idyllic Key West Butterfly & Nature Conservatory. I could have spent hours just watching these salmon-pink creatures, the butterflies swooping past my nose and storybook birds like the turaco, moss green with a mohawk and eyes that follow your every move. A lovely little haven right by the southernmost point.  #DriveUS1 #Flkeys #SeizeTheKeys

After more than 4,000 miles on the road, 46 days, 13 states and at least three dozen doughnuts, I've reached the southernmost point of the US - a mere 90 miles from Havana, Cuba. It seems like yesterday and at the same time a lifetime ago that I set pedal to the metal at the start of US Route 1 in Fort Kent in Maine, so far north there are bridges where your front wheels could be in Canada, your back wheels in the US. It isn't quite over yet, though. I still have a day to explore and eat my bodyweight in key lime pie in Key West. Then I get to relive it all in front of my keyboard as I write about all the highlights from my epic #DriveUS1 road trip. Or I could just turn around and do it all again in reverse... ^Ella #Flkeys #SeizeTheKeys

There aren't many beaches in the Florida Keys, though there are endless opportunities for fun in the water. The beaches they do have, though, are world class.

This handsome fella followed me around the pier at Robbie's Marina. Probably because I had a bucket of fish to handfeed the huge tarpons swimming around the edge. The fish leap up and grab the snacks from your fingers - if the pelicans don't get there first... #DriveUS1 #SeizeTheKeys #Flkeys ^Ella

Mrs. Mac's Kitchen in Key Largo has more licence plates on display than destinations I've visited as part of #DriveUS1 - all donated by customers, who come for the key lime pie (with Graham cracker crust) and stay for the kitsch decor.

This is one of the most famous churches in Champagne region, not just because it's a striking 15th century landmark. But it is also the final resting place of champagne guru Dom P√©rignon. A Benedictine monk and cellar master at the abbey in Hautvillers, Dom P√©rignon pioneered a number of winemaking techniques. He was the first to blend grapes to improve the quality of wines, to balance their various elements, and perfected the art of producing clear white wines from black grapes - a major feature of Champagne's wines. Tomorrow our friend @thelondonfoodie goes to Burgundy to sample full-bodied reds and unearth fascinating stories from there, follow along on #VisitFrenchWine

Hello from Rome where we're on something of a romantic break, while Ella is still motoring around Florida. The Eternal City has a special place in our hearts as I brought Terry here on a surprise birthday break 12 years ago. It was one of the best city breaks we've had, in part because it has such a wealth of history (it's something like 2,769-years-old, people!) and it wears its fascinating past on every corner, the stories of ancient Romans seeping from the walls of its crumbling buildings. But it's also special because after hours walking every inch of the city we cemented our shared passion for travel. It's wonderful to be back here again, on a city break with Jet2Holidays, after such a long time since our last visit. And we've started walking the city once more, soaking up the places where locals and tourists congregate in squares and around its many lovely fountains. We came across this one today in Barberini. A golden hour spectacle, but it isn't our favourite fountain. Join us tomorrow for a Facebook Live broadcast on the link in our profile to see our favourite landmark, and follow our Roman Holiday on #Jet2Europe.

There's no need to spend a fortune to have fun in #orlando - this view over Lake Eola Park, one of many green spaces in downtown, is completely free, for example. With free museums and galleries, money-saving park combo tickets and happy hour deals on food and drink (that last all afternoon), Orlando can be one of the best value destinations for families, couples and groups of mates.

This is the cellar @champagne_bollinger in France's Champagne region. Their cellars wind and wend across seven kilometres, under the village of Ay, and contain 750,000 bottles, each maturing until they're ready to make a popping appearance at a celebration, party or glamorous event. It was fascinating to see all those rows of bottles, some of which had been there for 10 years or more. A couple years ago a small number of bottles from 1830, in Bollinger's early days of production, had been discovered hidden away in a little corner of the cellar. A wonderful find! As fascinating as it was though, I couldn't help but feel a little spooked in the confusing maze of tunnels and was delighted to head above ground and taste a Bollinger special cuv√©e, a ros√© and a 2005 Grand Anne√©. They may even have tasted better after we knew where the bottles had been hidden away all those years! #VisitFrenchWine #MadeinChampagne

Champagne is the colour. Warm sunshine lit our path as we travelled through France's Champagne region. While the bubbles filled our glasses, the golden hues of autumn covered the vine-filled valleys.

Where in the world can you drive on the beach? Legally, that is, and without getting stuck. The 23 miles of elephant grey sand at Daytona Beach is wonderfully broad at low tide and compacted enough to allow wheels to roll smoothly over its surface, the odd crackle and pop of seaweed under the tyres. I took my #DriveUS1 buddy Harrison (my @hertz Ford) to try it out. Not at the 270-plus mph speeds professional racers used to hit, when events were held here from 1902 until the Daytona International Speedway opened in 1959. Now visitors have to stick to a leisurely 10mph cruise.  #LoveFL #WeekdayGetaway

Daytona Beach is famous for its Speedway and Nascar races, but it's also a classic, cool beach destination well worth an extended stop along #DriveUS1. Starting with shrimp and grits at Crabby Joe's (location - right in the Atlantic Ocean, basically, with a fishing pier and tiny gift shop out back) I'm discovering the many sides of this Florida fun town.

A fortnight ago I stayed in this adorable rose cottage at JOLO Winery in North Carolina's endlessly surprising Yadkin Valley. It's nicknamed the 'Newlywed Chateau' but I very much enjoyed having the huge bed, peaceful back terrace and a bottle of owner JW Ray's finest all to my self. I think the cottage looks like a cute face, with curious blue eyes and a hat. Can you see it? Oh, and the weather vane is a wine bottle. #DriveUS1 #visitnc

Power players and politicians in Washington DC aren't all about fancy lunches. Old school diner Ben's Chili Bowl is a favourite spot that draws hundreds of customers every day. And Barack Obama is among those to have sampled their half smokes and fries smothered in a secret chilli recipe. When he stopped by, weeks before his inauguration, he happily chatted to customers and posed for selfies. This mural is painted on the side of the eatery's original U Street venue in his honour. #DriveUS1 #MyDCCool #CapitalRegionUSA

One of my (many) favourite views from the scenic byways of Maine - this one on the Bold Coast, where it's impossible not to pull into every lookout point and gawp. Three weeks and more than 2,500 miles into our big #DriveUS1 road trip - this feels like a lifetime ago. #MaineThing ^@ellabuchan

You haven't tasted bread until you've visited La Farm Bakery in Cary, North Carolina. Master baker Lionel Vatinet elevates loaves to a whole new level.

Alexandria, Virginia was a complete revelation. Just a half hour drive from Washington DC and a world away. The waterfront, with a marina bobbing with boats, is soon to have a chain of green parks, creating a pedestrianised walkway. And you can see the capital over the water. Highly recommended as a DC add on - you can get the Metrorail in 15 minutes! #DriveUS1 #ExtraordinaryALX

Just a 15 minute drive from the centre of Provincetown is an entirely different world of rolling sand dunes, shrub oaks and 19 artists' shacks built in the 1930s. This one, perched on the dune to the right, is where Tennessee Williams spent several summers - and where he wrote A Streetcar Named Desire. Apparently Marlon Brando sauntered over the dunes to visit him a couple of times, before he landed the male lead in the acclaimed film. #DriveUS1 #VisitMA

This cute home was once located across the harbour in Long Point, at the extreme tip of the flexed forearm of Cape Cod. Now in a quiet part of Provincetown, this and 29 other homes bear little blue plaques denoting a floating house - because they were literally floated across to their existing locations. It's thought the settlers, who left Long Point in the late 1950s, were worried about being swept to sea and simply didn't want to leave their homes behind. A stroll here spotting the little ceramic plaques makes a welcome break from the sometimes manic centre of this quirky little town. #DriveUS1 #VisitMA

Sometimes the reflection of a sunset is just as pretty (I might even argue prettier) than the  blazing display itself. These pink skies in South Yarmouth, Cape Cod back up my point.

Bogs are a big deal in Massachusetts - and they are blooming beautiful too. Usually the harvest starts in mid-October until early November, but I managed to track down one of the few cranberry bogs harvesting right now. And I'm so glad I did. Seeing these raspberry-ripple lakes bobbing with ruby fruits (they flood the vines so the buoyant berries float to the top, making them easier to harvest) was mesmerising. Who needs fall colours, hey?* *I'm still looking for fall colours... #DriveUS1 #VisitMA ^@ellabuchan

Ready for a lobster crawl? No, that doesn't mean munching through a mountain of lobster rolls. The historical town of Plymouth in Massachusetts has 29 snazzy crustaceans throughout its waterfront and downtown, each fibreglass sculpture designed and hand painted by local artists. This snappy sir was sponsored by the Plimoth Plantation and features detailed scenes of Native Wampanoag people, who lived here when the first settlers arrived from England in 1620. #DriveUS1 #VisitMA

Plimoth Plantation is a living, breathing museum taking visitors back to the 17th century, when settlers or pilgrims arrived in the Massachusetts town of Plymouth - the oldest municipality in New England. The Wampanoag Homesite features Native staff, some of whom belong to the tribe that lived on these shores when the British arrived. While the 17th Century English Village has characters in traditional dress to talk about their lives since landing in New England. It also boasts this timelessly beautiful view over Cape Cod Bay. #DriveUS1 #VisitMA

Captain Bob of Finestkind Cruises kindly (and trustingly) let me steer his boat yesterday en route back from a cruise up to Nubble Lighthouse in York, Maine.

Never 'pinch' a parking spot from a lobsterman... Here in Ogunquit and the rest of Maine, they work hard for the privilege of catching some of the world's best lobsters. They must come from Maine and, at the moment, five lobstermen must retire for each new licence given out. Problem is, they rarely hand in their nets... #DriveUS1 #MaineThing

Portland, Maine is a compact city packed with charm. This fella, Portland poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, marks the beginning of the hip Arts District, with record shops, bookstores and cute cafes.

Another day, another lighthouse - although this time it's the walk that is most breathtaking.  It's just under a mile each way to Rockland Breakwater Lighthouse, jumping and hopping over deep crevices between the flat rocks that make up the walkway as you go. And you're rewarded with 360-degree views of the ocean. #DriveUS1 #MaineThing @visitmaine

We made it! This is America's first mile, the beginning of the historic US Route 1 - right on the border with Canada. The St John River, just over the grassy hill in this picture, marks the border and you can see it as you drive further south. There is some dispute as to whether this is actually the beginning or end of the road, though, with another sign saying the route begins in Key West, Florida. Either way, it's the start of our great American adventure and we'll be driving south to discover all the most amazing people, places and sights of US1. All 2,446 miles of it. @visitmaine @hertz #DriveUS1 #MaineThing #visittheusa #usa #us1 #roadtrip #discoveramerica

It's all a ploy! Or, more accurately, a 'ployes'. These Acadian flatbreads, made from buckwheat flour, have been produced by the same family in Fort Kent, Maine since the '80s. Filled with fruit and topped with granola, it's the perfect breakfast to kick off our great American road trip down the east coast.

We're in the Dutch town of 's-Hertogenbosch, in the sunny south of the country, and have fallen in love with its architecture. From Dutch gabled roofs to this Art Deco former shopping centre, its buildings have a lot of character.  #bezoekdenbosch

The modern curves of Zaha Hadid's creations epitomise forward-thinking Innsbruck. Despite the fact that it is considered one of the most historic of Austria's cities, with an imperial past, Innsbruck revels in modernity - from architecture to art. But the built environment isn't where this city's visual attractions end. It is encircled by the Tirolean Alps, and the Bergisel ski-jump is one of the best locations from which to enjoy the view. Read more about Innsbruck's time capsule of culture on the link in our profile. #roundtripAustria

Think of an imperial Austrian city and we would conjure images of the palaces of Vienna. But the Tirolean city of Innsbruck really revels in the history, art and culture of Imperial Europe, as evidenced by this - the spectacular painted ceiling of the Giant's Room at the city's Hofburg. And there's no need to crane your neck to get a look at the enormous artwork, mirrors across the room help with the hard work. It really is the kind of room that makes you say "wow" when you enter. Oh, and aside from the ceiling, don't miss the portraits around the room of Austrian royalty (including French queen Marie Antoinette) - the women wore some incredible hip-multiplying underskirts! #roundtripAustria #myinnsbruck

Today Austria filled our lives with rich colour! Armschlag is a village in Waldviertel, a quarter of Lower Austria of granite hillsides carpeted with forests. This is Mother Nature's garden, where we were greeted by hares bounding across our path on arrival at Hotel Schwarz Alm. Armschlag - a short drive from the hotel - is also called Mohndorf, or Poppy Village. It's home to just 100 people, 80 of whom work in cultivating, protecting and creating products from poppies. Not only did our eyes marvel at all the poppy reds, pinks and whites, but they fulfilled other senses too - our noses were filled with their sweet scent. Then there was taste in a delicious meal of poppy crusted schnitzel and carp, and poppy cakes, sweet poppy gnocchi and ice cream. #waldviertel #feelaustria

Exploring history in Ireland wasn't all about dusty relics, cairns and castles. We also enjoyed Ireland's beautiful landscapes and pretty villages. We fell in love with these quaint cottages in Trim, right opposite its 800-year-old Anglo-Norman castle. They really brought some colour to the area. We want the one with the pink door! Which would you choose? There's more on #IrelandsAncientEast this week with friends of ours travelling south to Waterford, Kilkenny and beyond - check them out for more Irish views!

Ever fancied yourself in an ancient castle playing as lords and ladies? Well Trim Castle certainly lives up to the fairytale, at least on the outside. Head inside for a tour and you get a sense of what it was like to live in the 800-year-old Anglo-Norman castle. Though its whitewashed walls gleaming light throughout, and modern conveniences like a garderobe, made it a wonderful castle in its time, it's naturally a million miles from modern living. But the beauty of our travels through #IrelandsAncientEast is that it's given us so many authentic, historical experiences. Visiting and learning all about Trim was just one of them we would recommend.

The River Boyne has been a regular feature of our time in #IrelandsAncientEast. It was the lifeblood of Drogheda, where fishing trawlers plough the mouth of the river, as it empties into the Irish Sea. We then picked it up near Slane Castle, and today beside Trim Castle. Here it was only a small part of the broad, rushing river it was 800 years ago when the Anglo-Norman castle was built.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b99faebbde0fcd229e888652bffa9441/5BD69CBF/t51.2885-15/e35/13398880_981145888670887_1626510591_n.jpg
Ireland's Slane Castle is about to become famous for whiskey when it starts distilling next year. But it's most famous as the scene of many a great rock concert. All the greats have played there - no cliche, no exaggeration. From the Foo Fighters to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Queen and the Rolling Stones - they've all rocked the amphitheatre beside this 18th century castle. But what you may not know is that the band U2 once lived in the castle for a few months. Ironically they recorded their album The Unforgettable Fire in this, the castle's spectacular ballroom (with this gorgeous wood carved ceiling). Why the irony? Seven years after the album's release Slane Castle suffered a fire that almost destroyed it. Thankfully much of it, including this room was saved, and now it's one of many great castles to explore in #IrelandsAncientEast.

Amazed by the variety of wild and colourful flora and fauna in Mauritius, which all adds the feel of being some place exotic. Spotted this batatran flower on a bicycle tour of the fishing village of Grand Gaube, which can be found all around the island. The tour was a great way to experience local life and admire the natural colour and beauty of the island. It truly earns itself  the title of pearl of the Indian Ocean. #MyMauritius

Ireland isn't known as the Emerald Isle for nothing! This is the beautiful garden at Beaulieu House, a country manor which dates back more than 800 years. Its many original features, a Jacobean staircase and more are just some of the attractions of the house. But head outside and you can lose yourself in its landscaped gardens. It's just one of many treasures we've unearthed in #IrelandsAncientEast, an area within driving distance of Dublin, and with a staggering 5,000 years of history!

Just a short boat ride from Mauritius, Ile Des Deux Cocos is an island made for adventure. Snorkel in the bay to view the coral which is more than 800 years old, a myriad of colourful fish and enjoy the azure blue waters of the bay. After lunch, pull up a hammock and enjoy the vistas laid out before you - the stuff postcards are made of in #MyMauritius

Checked in at the Four Seasons Anahita on the East coast of Mauritius and was whisked off for a twilight spa experience. After a long day, the Mauritius Fusion Massage was much needed and such a blissful escape. Starting with a foot bath followed by a full body massage, relaxing on the veranda made the perfect finish before dinner. #MyMauritius

Well it's now time for me to leave the Maradiva Villas Resort and Spa. Greeted with spectacular vistas overlooking the pool, it didn't take long to ease into a state of relaxation.

Casela World of Adventures is a popular wildlife attraction in Mauritius. Rich in lush landscape and home to a variety of wildlife, the park offers a range of activities to allow you to enjoy the views and the resident wildlife. Today it was all about conquering my fear of heights, completing three zip lining courses but the backdrop of Rempart Mountain and the landscape below were so breathtaking, it made it all worthwhile. So much so, I could do it all over again! This is #MyMauritius

Welcome to Mauritius! Today I checked in at the Maradiva Villas Resort and Spa and what a view. The resort is spread across 27 acres so you are bound to find your own space for solitude, from the tropical gardens to the resort spa which offers rejuvenating ayurvedic treatments. The villas each have their own private pool while the Coast2Coast restaurant is just a few steps away from this glorious stretch of sand - another spot for some peace and tranquility.

Red is the colour at Tablas del Daimiel... as well as yellow, violet, blue, pink and verdant greens. This perfectly peaceful corner of Castilla-La Mancha was one of those travel surprises, somewhere that might not sound incredible on paper (wetlands with the opportunity for bird watching), but is transformative. There we shook off the cares of modern life, the rush and constant challenge of airports and took time to smell Spain's spring flowers. Home to Spain's fourth largest river, 200 bird species and plenty of places for quiet reflection, we'd highly recommend a visit! #InLaMancha

"The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind..." No matter the question. This is the town of Consuegra, famous for its windmills, used to mill wheat and all manner of things. When Castilla-La Mancha's forests were decimated to make galleons for Spain's explorations into the New World, these already dusty plains were transformed. With few trees there was little rain leaving its water mills redundant. But these wide open plains resulted in one thing - a good gust of wind. Today the windmills are a testament to quiet Consuegra's character, and its past life. Visit and you may catch Castilla-La Mancha's famous literary character, Don Quixote, ensuring maidens aren't swept away by the wind, or the region's blustery beauty. #InLaMancha

Today we've arrived in Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain. It's the kind of place that people seem to know best from a speeding train as they fleet across its dusty plains on express trains from Madrid. And you see that's how you miss out on all the good stuff, because these plains are dotted with the kind of historic towns that drive writers to put pen to paper (or perhaps that's quill to parchment, as the region was made famous more than 400 years ago by Cervantes in the book Don Quixote). It's also full of windmills and elegantly Spanish towns like this one, Almagro. See more from this fascinating region in the coming days on #InLaMancha

The words "secret beach" are pretty tempting. You immediately want to find yourself in its embrace, enjoying a little escapism. It makes you want to sink your toes into its sands, and swim in its waters. And that's what makes this cave in Menorca so tantalising. The azure water leading into its dark crevices takes you through to one of the island's best kept secrets. That's the thing about this island - so many unique, hidden secrets to unearth... #MustSeeMenorca

Sail away with us. Today we're exploring Menorca's beaches by boat in the south and on foot in the north, from Cala Galdana. Did you know: Menorca has more than 130 beaches? That's more than Majorca and Ibiza put together. Also many are made for toe-in-the-sand escapism - they're only accessible from a walking trail, so are secluded and pristine. #MustSeeMenorca

This time last year we visited Menorca for the first time. We didn‚Äôt know what to expect of this Spanish island, but liked what we found. It‚Äôs an island of culture with its own language and deep rooted traditions, an island of gastronomy with artisan cheese producers, wine makers and special meals fit for a king (Spain‚Äôs former monarch was known to pop over for its delicious lobster stew). It‚Äôs also an island of adventure with sailing, kayaking, hiking and biking among the options, or you can just lounge luxuriously on one of its beaches. We‚Äôre heading back to Menorca this weekend excited at what else this Balearic beauty has in store. Highlights from last year's trip on link in profile. Follow our finds on #MustSeeMenorca across social media.

I've often wondered what it would be like to wander around the desolate streets of a ghost town. And though Al Jazirah Al Hamra isn't an ancient town (it was only abandoned in the 1960s), it was still fascinating to be surrounded by its history - the lives of all those who went before crumbling away into dust. The town was originally home to three tribes, and ruled by the Al-Zaab tribe, who were rehoused in Abu Dhabi following a dispute with the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah. Locals are convinced this isn't just a ghost town but a ghostly one, and have reported many hauntings. Luckily we left just after this sunset. #DiscoverRAK

A moment of peace. We loved our Rainforest Experience at the Banyan Tree Al Wadi way out in Ras Al Khaimah's desert. Moving from hot to cold - steam rooms to ice caves and tropical rain showers, we found our desert nirvana. The resort is like an oasis - set out on its own for perfect escapism. #DiscoverRAK

We're in Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates, and headed into the desert to go dune bashing. It's always fantastic fun bumping around in the car roaring uphill and slipping down dunes. But one of our favourite parts of the experience? Just stopping to take in the endless peaking dunes near the Bedouin desert camp. Our driver, Ahmed, pausing to check his phone notifications here wasn't just the best driver we've had on a dune bashing trip. He shows that even in this timeless landscape, modernity continues to roll in on the desert winds. Follow our trip across social media as we #DiscoverRAK

We're across Berlin right now for travel show, #ITBBerlin. Berlin is a great city of course, but with mountains and delicious lakeside views we'd rather be in #salzburgerland right now. Love this photo of Lake Fuschl by @_annamaria_a too!

Before visiting Australia I'd imagined it would be characterised by very dry, dusty landscapes. But in five days driving around the state of Victoria from Melbourne, I saw so many landscapes. The views changed regularly as I journeyed along the Great Ocean Road to The Grampians and through the Goldfields to Daylesford, Victoria. There were beaches and coastal cliffs, giving way to forests, like this white gum tree forest in Cape Otway National Park. Then mountainous slopes rising up from farmed plains, and large lakes feeding green fields. Not quite the Australia I had in mind, but Victoria has proven to be one thing - a very varied state. #australiaroadtrip

Last light at Cape Otway on Melbourne's Great Ocean Road. The lighthouse was built in 1848 and is the oldest in Australia. Lightkeepers were charged with maintaining the light ‚Äì shining a ‚ÄúBeacon of Hope‚Äù onto Bass Strait to prevent loss of ships. We enjoyed spending time there as part of our #australiaroadtrip, and loved its end of the Earth feel. Next stop: Antarctica.

The organic kitchen garden @royalmailhotel is the largest in Australia. Pretty impressive for a 30-room hotel in a town of 480 people. The luxury hotel is in Dunkeld, in The Grampians - a spectacular mountainous landscape, around three hours drive from Melbourne. They operate companion planting, compost all organic waste for use in the garden, and more. The ducks in the picture aren't just there for the cuteness factor either. They have a job to do and are there to eat the bugs thus preserving the produce for use in all the meals and cocktails served in the hotel. #australiaroadtrip

Melbourne is such a cultured city with an amazing array of arts events. Yesterday I saw all manner of art from the street art of the Laneways, to indigenous works at the Ian Potter Gallery, and Manifesto featuring Cate Blanchett at the Australian Centre for Moving Image. But nothing has Melburnians more excited just now than the latest exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria. Andy Warhol & Ai Weiwei, is a fascinating show revealing the parallels in philosophy, style and influences between these two great artists. This was one of my favourite parts of the show - Ai Weiwei's Forever Bicycles, featuring 1,500 stainless steel bike frames. The exhibition is well worth seeing and is on until April 24. #australiaroadtrip

We're in Melbourne, and had a very early start today, getting up before daylight. But being able to fly over the city in a hot air balloon with @globalballooningaustralia made it all worthwhile. The rising sun burning across the sky revealed the many green spaces in Melbourne's CBD. Perhaps this is why it often tops the list of the world's most liveable cities. Tomorrow we jump in the car to hit the Great Ocean Road and The Grampians. It's set to be an incredible journey so be sure to follow along on #australiaroadtrip

There's something about Northern Europe, from the Nordic countries to the Baltics that reaches into your very soul. It's a cold landscape, one carved of rock and ice, but man does this make it beautiful! It also leads to unusual travel experiences like the ice we sailed through on Eckero Lines' Finlandia ferry between Helsinki, in Finland, and Tallinn, Estonia. An ice-breaker ship it can handle anything the frozen Baltic Sea cares to throw at it. The result? A surprisingly smooth crossing and other-worldly views for passengers. #nbefinland #eckeroline

We're in Estonia - just two and a half hours from Helsinki by ferry (see our Periscope of our journey across a seriously frozen Baltic Sea - huge chunks of ice and all - on the link in our profile). We then drove two hours from Tallinn to Lahemaa National Park, right by the sea. It's popular for its beaches, and wildlife including deer, bears and wolves, but is totally snowbound right now. Still, if we could choose a place to live in Estonia it would probably be this pretty house in the park. #visitestonia #nbefinland

If there really was a Winter's Tale it would be set in Espoo, Finland. We've had a day of snowbound adventures in the Nuuksio National Park - snowshoeing, skiing, roasting sausages and drinking Glogg√Ø, a warm berry juice, around a fire in the blue teepee. Just the best ways to enjoy -25C. #nbefinland #visitespoo

When it gets cold in Finland, it gets COLD! We've been singing The Weeknd's "I Can't Feel My Face" much of the week. Here @oksa_sun has stepped onto the Lahti region's largest lake, a frozen Lake P√§ij√§nne, for snow-shoeing, and gotten all iced-up. She's clearly loving it despite it being -29C! #nbefinland #visitlahti

May your path be bright in 2016. This is Rajdamnoen Street, in Bangkok, home to Thailand's Grand Palace and Democracy Monument, and location for one of the city's major New Year's celebrations. It was still packed with people enjoying the first day of 2016 tonight after the New Year was welcomed in with endless fireworks. The red, white and blue are the colours of the Thai flag while the yellow lanterns symbolise Thailand's revered King. #happynewyear

Today we spent some time exploring Milan's bustling Piazza Del Duomo and simply in awe of the incredible sights of the cathedral and the sounds of the surrounding busy square softly lit in the late afternoon sun #unahotels

Amazed by the Porta Nuova district of Milan, and the perfect light at this time of day. Enjoyed capturing the sights and being part of the buzz around the Christmas markets that sit just over this bridge - really getting into the festive spirit! #unahotel

We've been on brand new cruise ship @norwegiancruiseline's Norwegian Escape this past couple of days to celebrate the ship's launch in the UK before it heads over to its home port of Miami from where it will sail the Caribbean. It's been a fun couple of days, but very busy as we've been charting our time onboard in a series of live broadcasts on Periscope (link to our scope profile, in our profile). So it's lovely to wind down at one of the ship's many, many bars. This is Sugarcane where they serve mojitos in colourful flights of six in signature flavours. Our fave? Raspberry guava. #NorwegianEscape

Today we can't get enough of San Sebasti√°n's architecture. From the baroque cathedral to the clean lines of the neo classical old town, and its art nouveau decorative balconies and stained glass. This is the gothic/enlightenment setting of San Telmo Museum, a former monastery and church. #SeeSanSebastian #visitspain

"In a Balenciaga, you were the only woman in the room - no other woman existed," said former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland. A museum dedicated to the life of one of Spain's premier fashion designers is in his home town of Getaria, near San Sebasti√°n. His creations dressed celebrities, royalty and heiresses from the 1920s to his death in the 1970s, and continue to inspire today's fashionistas. #SeeSanSebastian #visitspain

Do you ever fall in love with a landmark/place from the moment you see a photo of it? I did with this, San Sebasti√°n's former bullring. Today I saw it in person and it was even more spectacular. It stretches across every side of Constitution Square. Families would view the event from each window box/balcony. Despite its history, I love this building and all of its colour. #SeeSanSebastian

This is the Ice Q, setting for the upcoming James Bond film, Spectre, and a gourmet restaurant. It was not quite a table with a view today. But on a day without the whiteout of an early Tirolean winter, this would have quite the view onto the Tiefenbach glacier. See the outside of this rather cool building before it hits cinema screens next week in the Periscope we did from more than 3,000m over Austria (link in profile) and check out where we're staying, @dascentral_soelden, in S√∂lden. #12hotels

We're in Salzburg celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Sound of Music by taking the eternally popular Sound of Music tour. Recognise the church here? It's the setting of Maria's wedding to Captain von Trapp in the film. We've interviewed the "kids" from the film, plus Johannes - the youngest of the real life von Trapp children, and tonight we're going to a gala event including a concert at the Kulisse Salzburg festival halls, scene of the singing competition in the film.

It's a scene that never gets old. Athens' Acropolis creates a spectacle from nearly every corner of the city centre, drawing your attention from the blue skies of the morning to the pink-orange of the Golden Hour and the inky blue of night. This photo was taken from the restaurant of our luxury hotel, the King George, in Syntagma Square. In fact it was our second luxury hotel in the square after our stay next door at the Grande Bretagne. They both have luxury suites, excellent restaurants, and more, but having the Acropolis in your sights is one of the greatest luxuries of Athens. #ThisisAthens #luxuryseekers

This is Athens. Really - #ThisisAthens! Sailing the Greek islands is high on our luxury wish list, but did you know you can sail the Aegean Sea right out of Athens? We did so today, on a 57-foot Beneteau chartered from Vericos Yachts. The marina is just 25 minutes from the centre of Athens, and coasting along on the quiet breeze was the perfect antidote to the rush of the city. #luxuryseekers

You really can get suited and booted for less in Athens. We went to McArthur Glen, a designer outlet village on the outskirts of the city, today. Now these bright "jelly" boots might not be for everyone. But with cool Greek designers and international brands from Alberta Ferretti to Versace, we found it had something for everyone. Plus the prices were very affordable. Still, when you get up to 70% off in each store, plus another 10% off with their Tourist Passport and 18% tax back on your purchases at the airport, you could be paying just 2% of the original price! Now that's our kind of shopping!! #ThisisAthens #luxuryseekers

Like the spa? So do we. And we kind of hit it hard today. We snuck in a quick swim and steam at our hotel, the Grand Bretagne. Then this afternoon we headed down to the Athenian Riviera to the Divani Thalasso Spa for yet more pampering. We followed hydrotherapy, steam and sauna sessions with two fantastic treatments. Only problem? They made us fall asleep. We have a love/hate relationship with fab spa treatments that put you to sleep. Love the total relaxation. But hate sleeping through the good bits! #ThisisAthens #luxuryseekers

One of the things we adore about Athens is its history (just read our latest post - link in profile and you'll get a sense of just why). But there's much more to it than meets the eye. It's tempting to see Athens as full of monuments built during Ancient Greece, but there's also Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman history in the city. This mix of ancient history is very apparent in this photo - the Erechtheion of Ancient Greece's Acropolis sits on the hill with the ruins of the Roman Agora below. Out of shot is a mosque from the city's Ottoman era. What's perhaps most fascinating is that thousands of locals just wander past them each day without a second thought to their great significance - such is the wealth of history here.

We've spent the day seeking out luxury experiences in Athens, from the jewellers and designer shops of Syntagma to Kolonaki with its acacia and olive trees shading us from the autumnal sunshine as we took in its cool caf√©s. Still we couldn't resist a side trip to Plaka, the historic heart of Athens - and just look at the colour that we found there. We're about to takeover the @this_is_athens account to show you a little of upmarket Kolonaki.

Reflections of Stellenbosch. The wine region in South Africa's Western Cape is one of the most famous in the country and in the rest of the world. But what we didn't expect to find among the vines was such evocative landscapes, fantastic light like the clear skies and golden hour warmth that created this lakeside reflection (listen up photographers and artists), and an area with fascinating stories behind every label.

Tales of love run through the  Lanzerac Wine Estate in South Africa. Local couples have been going there for decades - "you knew a guy had class if he took you there on a date," we were told. The Stellenbosch estate with its Cape Dutch architecture and countryside setting is one of the oldest wine farms in the country, dating back to 1692. And Lanzerac is named after the one true love of its former owner, Mrs English.

France's Tricolore colours in the blue, white and red of the candles at Bayonne's cathedral. The blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris and are also associated with the Virgin Mary, the patron of France. But the colours have also been associated with the elements of revolutionary France - blue for libert√©, white for √©galit√© and red for fraternit√©. But whatever the meaning, we loved the use of colour and the warmth it created in this gothic building. See more about Bayonne on the link in our profile. #rendezvousenfrance
