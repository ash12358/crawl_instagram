For our Eid holiday we finally decided to pick this Japanese themed hotel in Chiang Mai, Haikin Ryokan after comparing between what @airasiagoth @hotelquickly @airbnb and @travelokath got to offer. . Initially we're aiming for Krabi but seeing the weather will be full with rains and fearing shops will be closed for Eid holiday, we opt for this northern Thailand destination instead. . Both Air Asia Go and Traveloka managed to offer interesting deals, however Traveloka wins as it offers wider option for payment, which in this case includes our Indonesian Bank account in @dbsbankid . Air Asia Go provides pleasing in-app experience, however it offered no other payment options instead of Credit Card. Its sibling App @airasia also charges around 300 THB to pay using our Thai's Kasikorn Bank, which we still used anyway as we don't see other means to book their flights. . For the staying and the Chiang Mai Saturday Night Market experience, visit our food & travel IG @epicurina. See you there! . Haikin Ryokan 142-144 Wua Lai Rd.

Salahsatu manusia teraneh yang pernah gw kenal, seru abis, biangnya usil dan experiment jahil, ada aja kelakuan sama kisah hidupnya yang bikin ngakak. . Misalnya: . Pulang ke rumah, tidur di sofa, pagi-pagi terjadi kegemparan karena ada tamu tak diundang (dia), ditanya sama yang punya rumah, "Anda siapa?", Jon balik tanya "Lho, anda yang siapa? Ini rumah keluarga saya!", dan dibalas sama yang punya rumah "Ooo anaknya pak X ya? Mereka sudah pindah". . Kampus lagi renovasi, dan sebagian dinding kampus ditutupi seng. Beberapa hari kemudian ada tulisan segede gaban di rangkaian seng tadi, "MILIK JONV, DIJUAL RP. 100,000" . Pas Ospek, ngirim junior buat bertanya ke Ketua Ospek (Pe'ong), tapi pas Pe'ong jawab, disela "maaf sebentar ada telepon", sambil balik badan pura-pura ngeluarin hape dari kantong. . We're definitely at loss. So long @jonvvick. . #RIPJonV #SRDarkDay

Finally, something to bring back my reading habit! Initially I planned to bought one upon returning to Jakarta as it's about 60 USD cheaper there than in Bangkok, however thanks to the special online discount, I managed to get the price as low as Jakarta. I liked it's simplicity, and it's a single purpose device so I don't get easily distracted by the itch to read my mails or messengers.

Trying to intuitively guess where the shuttle to Piyavate Hospital would be and I was right! . I'm not a big fan of relying on people's intuition as locations should be disclosed visually for better visibility, e.g.: MRT exits should include what's available out there, or the shuttle provider informs clearly which gate their customers should take. . Else you'll make your customers running back and forth picking the right exit, and in case of Bangkok, the exits are usually many, and located far from each other. . #signsystem #ux #userexperience #customerexperience #transportation #workinbangkok #lifeinbangkok

After some while of hiatus, I finally decided to just produce some cards, grab my bag, and head down to the nearby MRT Station to do a Guerilla testing. It was bone chilling at first, to be on public space with no wingman, and most of the people don't speak your language. However, based on my part research experience, if you approach people nicely, you can always find some willing participants. . It takes time for sure, but as long as you keep relentlessly approach people, you'll reach your goals. Other things I noticed working really well is to be honest and natural, and always approach people with expectation that they will reject you. . I ended up with seven willing participants ultimately, and managed to test out our hypothesis related with feature grouping. . What about you? What approach do you find suitable for Guerilla Testings? . #userexperience #uxresearch #guerillatesting #ux #uxdesign #userresearch #workinbangkok #worklife #uxthailand #uxid

Having spent some time doing food court hopping in Bangkok, one of the common pain points I discovered happens during queueing to exchange cash into debit card, as in popular food courts the queue tend to be long. . We're also forced to decide and deposited upfront how much money we'd like to spend, and when we occasionally misses, like when we're dining with the whole family, it means back to queueing at the cashier. Let's not forget that you'll still required to queue later to withdraw any deposit left. . Eathai in Central Embassy Bangkok, on the other hand, uses the "pre-approved" type transactions where each person are given this pre-registered card with 1,000 THB limit. Much like dining in Marche Movenpick, which uses "passport" instead of upfront cash deposit. . The trade off for customers I think, is on budgeting, whereas by using a debit card you're less likely to bought anything impulsively, while using the pre-approved card you're more likely to spend more. . Which payment method would you prefers? . #foodcourt #payment #userexperience #uxreview #ux #eatingexperience #shoppingexperience

One of the things that surprises me in Bangkok is that how relatively clean its pedestrians and traditional markets are, despite the rare sight of garbage bins. Even in most shopping malls, they're only available in the rest rooms, or at the end of escalators if you're lucky. So it's quite a rare sight to find four of them lined side by side like this.

Found these interesting fridge magnet figurines during a visit to the quirky Cabbages & Condoms Restaurant last weekend. It depicts indigenous tribes of Thailand, complete with writings about the tribe on the back. Does anyone know where else to get it in Bangkok? . #figurine #fridgemagnet #traditional #thailand #souvenirs

Finally visited the Klong Lad Ma Yom Floating Market, and it was huge! Just a handful of sellers on the boat though, while the rest resembles more a bustling Thai weekend market with streetfood, local produces & crafts.

Yesterday we attended the Kids' Coding Workshop brought by @welearnorg and @microsoft Thailand. It was fun and looks like my kid was also enjoying it, especially since part of the class was to do coding for Minecraft, one of his favorite game. . What I also found exciting is the approach the class take, which includes graph paper programming, and introduction into Blockly programming language, that write programs using drag and drop visual blocks. Quite a manageable learning curve for little kids, not to mention fun! . Don't forget to visit code.org for your kid's/own self learning. . #blockly #kids #kidsactivities #codingforkids #codedotorg

I remember the time when IKEA Catalog was a highly prized stuff for us Interior Design students, as it plays significant role in generating ideas for our class projects. . Years afterward my friends would start bringing home IKEA stuffs they bought aboard (raise your hand if you're one of them), then just a couple of years ago IKEA finally opened their store in Indonesia -- which basically creates a new travel destination in Tangerang, and people would be happy to travel from different cities, even islands, for just furniture shopping. . So today I'm bidding farewell not to just a mere businessman/designer, but to someone who's work has been life changing. Thank you Ingvar Kamprad for creating IKEA. . #ingvarkamprad #ikea #interiordesign

Visiting Bangkok Farmers Market at Gateway Ekkamai, Bangkok. The kids are curious to see some paws, while their parents are more curious to see some local produce. .

Yesterday EKO got a visit from Khun Tiwa York, Head Coach of Kaidee, the famous C2C marketplace in Thailand -- which happen to be a "cousin" of my previous workplace, OLX Indonesia! . The topic of the talk was team building and dynamics, and it was really inspiring, especially on the spirit of becoming Agile, i.e.: never stop trying out new better ways of doing thing -- If it turned out as a failure, you can either fix it or go back into doing things the old way! . Lots of ideas we can apply into our own UX/UI Team to make us feels more like a team instead of just a working group. One great start to begin 2018! . #lifeateko #worklife #workinbangkok #lifeinbangkok #teamekoapp #teamkaidee

Heads up for you traveling by airplane for/from Bangkok, I seen this warning posted at the check-in lines, which is quite too late if you carry the forbidden one, so I am also posting it here so you can prepare: . You're obliged to *only *carrying power banks in your cabin/carry-on baggage, and the Airport will *confiscate* your power banks if it exceeds 32,000 mAh (each). . Luckily mine was 30,000 mAh so it was permitted, but can you imagine how troublesome it is today, to travel without one, has it been confiscated? . #Bangkok #visitbangkok #visitthailand

A token from my past addiction in Bali: Sunrise photo hunting! And my favorite spot was in Serangan Island, separated with Bali only by a narrow water channel resembling more a river.

Finally tried Bangkok's water transportation on our journey back to the office this afternoon from visiting a client. . The speed, the splashes, the wind, the rocking, the need to raise the plastic curtain to avoid large splashes, and the terribly loud engine noise! Together it creates an exhilarating experience! . While getting on and off the boat requires some degree of balancing skill, and I consider myself quite dynamically balanced, my Thai colleague  does it effortlessly, in a skirt!

As the avid user of Instagram, I find the latest feature "Share with close friends (swcf)" really annoying! I often find that time and time again, I activated this function by accident, thus my post is missing from my timeline. . When it happened I usually suspected there's something wrong with my connection, and only after some failed effort to fix my connection, as there's nothing wing with it, I remember to check my swcf folder, and voila! It . To add some salt to the wound, any posts initially set as swcf can't be reverted back to public post! In Usability heuristics it fails on several fronts: . 1. Lack of Error Prevention - ideally a system should warn/ask confirmation from users of a non-reversible action -- like what this swcf does. 2. On the UI perspective, the switch to activate swcf is also prone to accidental click, as it's located near the main field, and there's hardly any noticeable change when you activate it. . 3. No recovery from errors - as once you set your post as swcf, there's no way to change it back to public. . 4. No immediate ways for user to recognize or diagnose whether his new post was set as swcf. . 5. Lack of Consistency - when you posts new photo, your gallery immediately updated, when you receive interaction, the love icon will immediately highlighted, but when you post as swcf, nothing happens on the swcf icon. . Or it could be just my problem. Any thoughts? . #uxreview #usability #userexperience #uxfail #usabilityissues #uxpuzzles

So a couple of days ago I contacted this game developer, complaining about a balance logic in their game, that matches my character with someone who's 23 levels higher, resulting in the end of my winning streaks. . The CS responded promptly and said they will forward the complain to related department. . Today out of the blue I got an in-game gift along with a system message informing there will be a game update on matchmaking balance! . Impressive development team! Not to mention the game also offers an exciting experience in which you play the role as a mounted archer. .

A token from the last family gathering in IBC Tangerang, comprising of my families from @hypnoticade side, a couple of days before our departure to Bangkok.

It's been a love and hate relation when it comes to Udemy. I love their courses, but hated how they manage (some) things. Like this Download Course function for example, which initially shows only a black arrow pointing downward -- a common icon for download, no ambiguity, at least for me -- It begins to get confusing though when the download process has started: 1. While the currently downloading item are shown with partial full circle, nothing is shown on the queued items, just an empty grey circle 2. When you click on that grey circle though, the system think you're removing that item from the queue, so you'll have to click it again to put the item back into the queue, at the end instead on its original sequence 3. When the download has completed, it will be shown as red arrow! When you click on the red arrow, the system think you're deleting the downloaded item, *without even asking for confirmation* 😱 -- Despite the lack of clarity on different download states which is confusing, the deletion without confirmation is a dangerous behavior, as recovering from that action will require user having to download that item again, penalizing users with extra time, extra connection cost, and really bad mood if the user can't get a good enough connection to retrieve the item back. Which is a good use case for people traveling to remote area, or having very limited connection. -- What would be great if the app also informs up front the size of the download, vs the existing space user has on his device, so he can ensure there's enough space left for whatever he's planning to do with his device. -- #ux #userexperience #uxreview #uxid #usability #udemy @udemy

Our first attempt on becoming Agile Family. We sat together with our eldest son and write on the post it about tasks he want to accomplish for today, (and what we think should be done), then post them on the wall according to it's current state: Backlog (To Do), Ongoing, and Done. -- Each card are formatted according to Pomodoro style of 25/5: 25 minutes of task, followed by 5 minutes of short break. Then after every 4 Pomodoro there's a longer 30 break. -- At the moment we don't do rigid prioritization yet as the goal is to onboard our family into this style of management first. We don't even aim for full productivity yet, just ensuring there's enough on the board. Already our son feels excited on doing it, as he got the chance to propose the activities he want to do too (i.e.: "Roblox","Growtopia","YouTube"). -- At the end of the day we'd do a Retrospective to review what works, what doesn't, and how to improve them. Let's see how it goes. -- #agilefamily #kanbanfamily #scrumfamily #familymanagement

It's my last day in Bandung so soon these connection quota will be unusable where I'm heading to. Initially I was afraid that 2GB data wouldn't be adequate to facilitate my online activity for a week, yet turned out I only used 75% of it. -- What would be great is a way to guesstimate how much data I'd use in the duration of my stay, so I can choose the most appropriate data package. -- What would be nice if the app can do a consumption rate, just like in cars, where it tells you how many hours left if I uses my data connection at current activities. -- What would be awesome if the provider can simply deposit my leftover balance, or convert it back to cash, any form of translation that would benefit me instead of simply call it a loss. -- #travelexperience #ux #userexperience #uxreview #uxid #telkomsel #telkomselapp @telkomsel

“Dan di antara tanda-tanda kekuasaan-Nya ialah Dia menciptakan untukmu isteri-isteri dari jenismu sendiri (manusia), supaya kamu cenderung dan merasa tenteram (sakinah) kepadanya, dan dijadikan-Nya di antaramu rasa cinta dan kasih sayang (mawaddah wa warahmah).

A token from last night's layover in Kuala Lumpur. Such an amazing view Petronas Towers is! From my experience traveling to some Asean countries, so far Malaysia wins the easiness of immigration check, when you're not even asked to fill in arrival/departure card, despite the long, almost one hour queue. There's also a mandatory fumigation onboard the Air Asia BKK-KUL flight just before we landed though, which was a new thing for me. What pleases me the most I think, was the ability to understand what people are talking about, which is a rare luxury in Bangkok, as I'm still striving to learn Thai. On a side note, I also fell in love with Indian Malaysian curries! -- #whileinmalaysia #explorekualalumpur #klcc #petronas

For me, this TV show is a very good evidence that we don't really know what's on our user's mind.

Unless you're inspecting in detail, you'd think the trip will lasts for less than two hours (06:45-08:05) while it's not. -- If you've been traveling to far away destinations quite often then you might notice that the missing (or extra) hours in your flight is due to the difference in time zone. -- As for me I'd rather be informed about this condition up front for clarity, by adding the time zone information for example. -- Has anyone been a victim of time zone differences between your departure and destination city? I once waited for 1 hour to meet someone in different country, only to find out I'm two hours early for the appointment. -- #uxdesign #userexperience #timezonedifference #traveloka #uxid

Starting the journey home for my sister's wedding this weekend in Bandung. This trip includes one night layover in Kuala Lumpur, as the next flight to Bandung is only available in the next morning. -- Previously upon choosing which route to take, I was considering Singapore as well. However, as surprisingly ticket to and from Singapore is significantly higher than to and from Kuala Lumpur, I prefer the later. Not to mention it will be an interesting experience as I've never been to Malaysia before. -- Flying home to Jakarta first? Well I just can't imagine having to drive for another 6 hours afterward. Or 9 hours if there's a major construction ongoing at the Cikampek flyover project. -- On a side note, Terminal 1-6 in Don Muang Bangkok is super crowded, and having unpleasant smell. -- See you in Bandung! -- #travelexperience #urangbandung #workinbangkok

Once upon a time in The Street Ratchada, Bangkok. -- Quite a sizable shopping mall but with few tenants, creating mostly empty spaces. -- The mall however, appeal mostly to kids and students. The first due to the trampoline and activity park upstairs, and the VR games on the 2nd floor. The later due to the Coworking Space existed on the 4th floor, which extended informally to the Basement, where most of the individual restaurants are. -- #thestreetratchada #coworkingspace #trampolinepark #bangkokshopping #bangkokforkids #whileinbangkok

Occasionally Xiaomi MiA1  portrait AI got confused in determining which edge it shall uses to stitch between the wide and the tele lens, resulting in miniaturized look like this one. -- The main reason I believe, is when there's an object that stretches from the front into the background like the wooden platform in this picture. -- Give it a clear demarcation between front and background and the MiA1 will create charming isolation. -- Normal light quality, it's considerably good though lacking the "extra crispness" of Samsung A5 2016 I used, which sometimes produces results on par with my NX300 on clarity. -- Low light quality tend to be suck, but keeping your hand really still and using timer had been proven to be successful remedy on some cases. Good enough for Instagram, as the high ISO artifacts is hardly seen on such resolution. -- I liked iPhone low light result better, but at 3-4 times the price? MiA1 is a sweet compromise, versatile enough for daily snapshots. -- All in all, the photo results of MiA1 is really not bad, both for a less than US$ 300 cellphone, and compared even with those on higher price ranges. -- #shotonxiaomi #shotonmia1 #camerareview #xiaomimia1 #xiaomireview

Encountered this amazing street parade last evening in front of Central World shopping mall, Bangkok. -- Turned out it's the part of Amazing Tourism Year 2018 launching. The parade was long, we watched the merriment for the whole way from Central World to the Siam BTS Station, but we didn't see the end of it! -- I Iove the details and the vibrating atmosphere it brings.

Last weekend our little family went on a visit to the legendary Chatuchak Weekend Market, housing 8,000 steak stalls in 27 different sections, making it the largest market of such kind in the world! -- Both my wife and kid are excited to have their first ever subway ride as well. Eventhough our Sutthisan MRT Station has no lift facility which makes reaching the platform requires some efforts. -- On the destination Chatuchak Station though, the travel with baby stroller is easier as there are lift facility available, however we missed it as there's no clear indication, and our communication with the MRT staff was lost in translation. -- From the Chatuchak MRT Station, reaching the weekend market was tricky as the roadside pedestrian are not stroller friendly, while the street was quite busy. -- What's surprising is that after managed to go through the outer section of the market, which was hot, and super crowded, we arrived at the road which divide the outer and the inner section of the market. Inside, the condition was more better for baby strollers, and surprisingly on most of the sections the temperature was cool! -- Some even have air conditioner installed and with the market's semi closed air circulation, creates a comforting cool air. -- Nevertheless the overall market temperature is quite hot, so dressing down is highly advised, wear a comfortable walking shoes, travel lightly, take care of your belongings, and even bring a portable battery powered plant for your kids. -- Another discovery we made is that it's better to stop at the nearby Kamphaeng Phet MRT Station, as it provides direct access to the Chatuchak inner sections, more friendlier for baby strollers, and less crowd. -- #chatuchak #chatuchakmarket #travelexperience #visitbangkok #visitthailand #travelblogger

As I begun to work in Thailand, one of the thing that I suddenly noticed is Thai people preference to use Line instead of WhatsApp. Hence it's a big plus for a communication app to look and feel like Line, as it gives the advantage of familiarity, which lower the barrier to product adoption. -- At the same time, my colleagues were startled to discover that in Indonesia, some people are still very keen on using Blackberry Messenger (BBM). -- Sensitivity to a market habit and culture is something UX designers must have, as it holds the key to a product adoption and user satisfaction. -- #uxdesign #uxthailand #uxthai #ux #line #whatsapp #ekothai #ekoapp #thaistartup

After doing most of my reading on electronic gadgets, what I discovered from two days of going back to (actual) book reading, is that book excels in reading comfort, and focus. While the first has a lot to do with clarity, text size, the feel of the book in your hand, the later deals with the fact that when reading an actual book, you don't get the usual distraction of checking your emails, new kitten video your friend upload on Facebook, or notifications from WhatsApp. You're "alone" with the book. On the downside it means extra thing to carry in your hand. Still a worthy trade of to some. How about you guys? Do you prefer actual book or e-book? And why? #userexperience #customerexperience #servicedesign #customerjourney #bookreading #actualbook #reading #commuting #piblictransport

A Service Design Manga! I accidentally stumbled upon this Japanese origin book under Business Book section at Gramedia, and was quickly drawn to it. Done as mini chapters dealing with specific issue, the book managed to carry its messages interestingly through background story which discovered in everyday occasion, like overhearing people talk about a local restaurant that used to be famous, or by randomly visited a restaurant in a travel destination. The topic is specifically related to restaurant business, which encompasses best practices on everyday aspect of a restaurant, including aspects like product management, human resource, and service experience! Done as mini chapters dealing with specific issue, the book managed to carry its messages interestingly through background story which conveyed in everyday occasion, like overhearing people talk about a local restaurant that used to be famous, or by randomly visited a restaurant. Highly recommended for those curious about restaurant management and service design! #serviceexperience #servicedesign #experiencedesign #customerexperience #ux #uxid #manga #restaurantconsulting

When I realized that the latest portrait shot I got was from a couple of years ago, I figured that it's time for a more proper selfie. So here it is! #selfie #portraitphotography

After using e-money for about a year, I can conclude that its greatest advantage is convenience: you get special lanes at toll road gates, which usually results in faster transaction, and you can also use it for riding Trans Jakarta buses. -- The biggest pain points though, lies in obtaining the e-money itself: convenient stores rarely have it, and not all toll road gates sell it. If they do, the included credit usually is just enough for one or two transactions. Which introduces us to the second biggest pain points: top-up. -- Just like the card's rare availability, the most common response I got from a convenient store's cashier is "Maaf Mandiri sedang offline," and if you think that you can do top-up from those gates with large "isi ulang e-money anda di sini" sign, boy you're in for a big disappointment. Open up Mandiri's bank account for the sake of e-money top-up from its  ATM? Then you need to open one in the same branch as your KTP. Which for regular Joe working 1-2 hours away from home it could mean taking a half day leave. -- As for myself, the workaround I find is to transfer money from my main bank account to my other bank that's on the same network with Mandiri, and uses its card on Mandiri ATM to top-up my e-money. Tedious and costly but it works! -- Why Mandiri e-money? Because up to some months ago most toll roads in Jakarta won't accept any other cards. I've tried BNI, and it got me stalled in front of toll-road gate blaming system error, while the technician who came to my aid simply said "memang belum bisa dipakai di sini pak." -- #emoney #mandiriemoney #tollroad #transjakarta #serviceexperience #userexperience #servicedesign #servicereview #servicesafari #painpoints #customerjourney #customerexperience

Waiting for the MRT in Bangkok. The city has three land hubs of transportation system comprising of Bus, MRT/Subway, and BTS/Sky Train interconnecting at some points. It's a clean, cheap, reliable alternative to the traffic infested roads. -- Single trip tickets are available through ticket booth, vending machine, and there's also subscription based membership. -- While I found most staff don't speak English, and people pronounce words quite differently from where I live, showing your destination on your cellphone at the ticket booth is a common and well accepted method. -- #BangkokMRT #mrtbangkok #transportation #visitthailand #chatuchak #citytransport

Landed in Don Mueang Airport Bangkok, then taking the 30 Baht (IDR 12K) A1 Bus to Chatuchak and switch to Bangkok MRT. The switch to BTS (Sky Train) is also done here. Despite the weathered appearance, the bus is well maintained, AC is cool (very important) and the riding experience is quite pleasing.

At the Sam Poo Kong temple. One of the traces of rich multicultural history that Semarang has, where local Javanese culture met Chinese, Arabic, and Dutch. -- The temple complex itself are divided in two area: the main area with the giant statue and the large courtyard which is accessible to public, and the other one with three temples mainly used for praying, thus access are very limited. -- #latepost #sampookong #exploresemarang #semarangexperience #wisatasemarang #jelajahsemarang #citytour #pesonaindonesia #holidayinsemarang #liburansemarang #customerexperience  #citybranding #tourism #citytourism #semarangtourism #pesonaindonesia #familyholiday

In one of Semarang's food destinations Sate 29, right across Gereja Blendug, Kota Lama.

Zayan shows his Air Asia model plane in front of the real one. It's been a while since he has increased interest in airplane, especially related to crash incidents. -- He satisfies his curiosity by studying documentaries found on YouTube, and computer simulation made to depict the moment of the tragedy, until he can confidently explain what was happening, how it happened, and what causes it. -- Looks like we have an air crash investigator in the making. -- #transportation #airplanes #aviation #airasia

Long queue at Terminal Blok M this evening to use the Trans Jakarta Koridor XIII heading to Ciledug.

Ended up composing this map of Semarang culinary delights for my last visit to Semarang.

What's good about Simpang Lima in Semarang is that it has a lot of things happenings, including street food night market circling around the area providing plenty of local culinary highlights in a decent pricing. What's need to be improved is wheelchair accessibility, which is quite surprising considering the wide well maintained pedestrian in the area. The problem itself lies in the construction of barrier poles, which originally, I assume, was intended to prohibit motorcycle and push cart access, but ends up disabling access to anything not on-foot. To those having vacation with a family it poses pain points as baby strollers are often have to be carried over the poles or detour into a car lane with full traffic, which both poses unpleasant experience. Should Semarang is looking to attract more family travelers, the local authority needs to put Semarang sidewalks more accessible. #experiencedesign #exploresemarang #semarangexperience #wisatasemarang #pedestriandesign #jelajahsemarang #citytour #pesonaindonesia #holidayinsemarang #liburansemarang #userjourney #customerexperience #customerjourney #citybranding #tourism #citytourism #semarangtourism #pesonaindonesia

One of the challenge for tourists visiting a new city is in finding which destination worth their very limited time, and compromise is often the only way out. As the result, a foodie often have to skip lots of notable food destinations, and ends up in their hotel room wishing they have more time to visit all the food destinations in their shortlist. This is where online food delivery services like GoFood comes as a worthy consolation option, as those you couldn't visit, GoFood can deliver! While there will be some downgrade of both quality and experience, it's usually a still worthy option, especially for someone with very limited time. The challenge lies however, in knowing what food are the best of the region? What foods are unique to the region? And this is where tourists are lost, as the features currently presented on the app are directed towards local residents, which most probably are more interested in trying the newest Korean food they usually saw on Korean TV Series, than something locally unique and historic, that they have been visiting since their childhood. Or something that their mom can cook herself. Therefore lies a potential value creation for the app to answer the need, like by creating some sort of curated list on what is locally good and authentic, especially for someone new to the city. This way the app would win multiple stakeholders of their app: the tourist visiting the city, the government by promoting local culinary treasures, and the restaurants by providing new sales channel.

Kiddo among The High Flyers of EF BSD. He started learning English from YouTube videos and honing his skill at Kids Club in hotels in Bali, where he uses a mix of broken English, gesture, and courage to interact with English speaking kids he encounters. The result? He could participate in simple discussion with almost fluid English, something I didn't manage until early high-school.  As the downside, I can no longer openly discuss secret matter in English with my wife, as he'd understand it. I guess it's time for his parents to learn a new language.

While the app provide a painless OTP verification unfortunately it succumb to the more basic issue of less transparent feedback: a generic "An error occured please try again" without specifically explaining what the issue is. - ⚠ What's even worse is the unrecoverable error happens during users choosing the transaction method, which basically is the conversion all businesses are looking for. - 💡What could be better is for the app to detect should similar error warning triggered more than twice in a row, it offers option to call by phone instead, and switch the screen to display the list of items ordered, so user can read it to the phone operator. - 💡What would be awesome is when the app called the human operators, they should already know who's ordering, the delivery address, and have the list of orders ready, as the missing step from the app was only about acquiring payment method. - #uxreview #uxdesign #userexperience #baduserexperience #pizzahutdelivery #otpverification #painpoint

Here's a better approach to OTP verification screen: a disabled resend button with countdown. In the case of missing OTP SMS there's also an option to report it. - 💡What would be more obvious is to show the amount of OTP request left, and displaying the destination phone number, as it was manually entered during registration, hence user might not remember which one used. - 💡During registration it should be stated that the entered phone number will be used for OTP verification. - Pizza Hut Delivery (PHD) @phd_id - #uxreview #uxdesign #userexperience #pizzahutdelivery #otpverification

OTP is one painful inflicting creature! Having worked in a biz that uses OTP verification, it gaged me to discover how erratic the server behaves! - While most request sent through, at times there's significant percentage of requests that failed! What worst is, many apps can't track when it occurred, thus resulting in lost conversion and bad user experience. - Take for example this OTP verification from Monster.co.id. I've checked my sms inbox for 12 hours btw, and none of the OTP ever showed up. Accommodating the technical issues, within this screen there should be a text somewhere that inform user about: - Time lapsed from the last OTP sent - OTP request left for this session (right below "Generate OTP" button?) - Disabled "Generate OTP" button after zero retries left, with countdown to next available request - Option to report when OTP never arrived + alternative way to verify,  or... - Acknowledgement that OTP failed and user are allowed to proceed with limited functions - As added note, businesses should be aware what the customs in different countries are, for example people in Indonesia are used to the format "08xx..." to write their mobile phone number. The form in example removes the zero hence making it looks unfamiliar. - During the phone number change on the other hand, the form informs users to format their number without leading zero as the app would add leading "+62" country code, but again on the example form, the country code is omitted. - #uxreview #usability #userexperience #uxdesign #baduserexperience #painpoint #otpverification

One of the common UI issue found during form filling on both Android and iOs: the popup keyboard covering part of the screen where the "next" button located. Or sometimes even covering the rest of the form. - Usually user will try to swipe the screen up in hope that the screen will scroll up to reveal the "next" button, however on many occasions the scrolling feature was disabled, leaving user confused as what to do next: - 😯"Tapping the back button? On most occasion it will bring me back to the previous page. Will I lose all of the information I've already put in instead?" - 😕"Tapping the "done" button on keyboard? Does it mean submission of the current content? Have I finished filling all the fields?" - While user can always rely to trial and error or gut feeling, the confusion and inability of the app to facilitate the interaction users looking for, meant there's usability issue, related to UI and interaction. - As natively Android don't have native navigation to "hide the keyboard," one of the solution we can apply to this situation is to provide ways for user to scroll down/up the page even when the keyboard is up. - #uxreview #userexperience #uxdesign

Started with assumption on how a customer went through a product/service experience, each group picked a specific journey they want to map. From the daily routine activities like shopping at convenient store, into the more complex one like choosing school for your kid, and boarding airplane. We then split each group into two roles: interviewers  and interviewees, and pairs them with people from different groups. The interview results then act as reference to change or improve the journey they have already mapped. In the end participants get a hands-on experience on developing assumptions, interviewing users to verify their assumptions, and incorporating insights gained into the journey map. Hopefully the skill would help them in ensuring good alignment between their own product and its customers. For prioritization tool, we also dip a little into identifying Moment of Truth, and how to turn those into value creation opportunity using the "how can we" approach. #startup #customerexperience #customerjourney #journeymapping #uxdesign #uxid #uxworkshop #digitalamoeba #therealgamechanger

Thanks to Telkomsel-Google Wallet integration, now can I buy books using my phone's prepaid credit ("pulsa"). A very important financial technology for people without credit cards (like me). I wonder how many of you feels helped or even empowered with this 'bayar pakai' pulsa feature? And mostly for what purpose? If you don't use it, why? #uxpoll #fintech #uxdesign

Found this curious big red box in Giant Hypermarket Alam Sutera, which my wife immediately recognized as a device related with online shopping. Turned out it functions as a sort of locker where you can either pick up stuffs you buy online, or store it here to return stuffs to online shops. From a quick browsing it seems like the UI are simple and intuitive. The biggest issue I think is in presenting what the machine is used for, as there's no marketing related information whatsoever (banner, brochure, or even branding) which could inform common people of its use. At the moment it makes sense only to those already familiar with returning online shopping goods. @popbox_asia We'd have another look at the experience later, after my wife is done preparing the document for the item she want to return. #uxreview #ecommerce #onlineshopping #tokoonline #popboxasia

This is a good example of Information Design: the customer gets more than a queue number, as it also informs how many people are left in the queue: something that matters more than random assigned numbers. What could be improved is making the information more obvious, along with the prediction in minutes, to make the information more meaningful. #userexperience #patientjourney #hospital #hospitalexperience #informationdesign #informationarchitecture #uxreview

While I was prepared and trained under science major, with the goal to study in ITB, I can't help but notice that my interest on the domain was gradually diminished. Meanwhile I've been drawn into drawing and design of things ever since very early. Mom said when I was about 2 y.o. I drew on bed sheet using a lipstick. During the same age I also drew OVER my dad's architectural blue print, which he hasn't submitted to his client. So when I found out that ITB also has Design Studies, it feels like a light has suddenly lit at the end of the tunnel. Thanks God I made it through, out of some 4,000 ish applicants. What I remember next are the strange feeling like I went back home. I was no longer that strange kid, feeling misfit, as everyone I know there are strange kids as well. Looks like I have finally found my lost tribe. #reuniperakitb92 #silverreunion #schoolreunion #desaininterior #kmsritb #fsrditb

OLX was visited by the guys from DBS Digibank to introduce their fintech app. As I was curious about their onboarding experience, I went through the whole signup process, and here's the summary. DBS Digibank provides a smooth sign up experience encompassing three domains: in-app, SMS, and face to face time with an agent. Requirements were also simple: an e-KTP, and NPWP. After the sign up process is done, user will have a new DBS Bank account, activated the App, and auto requested the debit card from the Bank. While there are some UX issues persisted during the signup, at least the issue was consistent thus it's easy to dealt with. #uxreview #userexperience #fintech #dbsbank #digibank #dbsdigibank #olxindonesia #onboarding

Feeling quite confused with Facebook videos on their official site introducing new product "Workplace." As you can see, it depicts its usage on cellphone, but the video format is landscape which makes it best to be viewed with desktop, and totally unreadable on smaller cellphone screens -- its target device. #uxdesign #baduserexperience #workplace #fbworkplace

I was cringed upon encountered this exhibition panel back in my campus. It's a part of my university year that I won't forget. It all started with my late buddy Victor who decided that I should lead our Interior Design contingent to the upcoming Temu Karya Mahasiswa Desain Interior Indonesia (TKMDII) in Surakarta. The thing is most of our friends have already assigned to help the preparation of Pasar Seni ITB, which happen only a month apart. Thus resources are very limited and those involved are somewhat reluctant as they already out of breath preparing for Pasar Seni, which was a more urgent priority. Long story short in the end we managed to bring the whole 2 classes: 92 and 93 instead of just handpicked a few, lots of supernatural encounter stories, awesome off events interaction, mass crush toward Trisakti contingents who are mostly women, and many more. Some even returned to Bandung shedding their Jomblo status. Surely one unforgettable experience. #reuniperakitb92 #silverreunion #schoolreunion #tkmdii #desaininterior #kmsritb

Found this old shot of me and Daniel Tumiwa, who turns out to become my next boss in OLX. I was already in the UX job back then, but what brings me to our meeting was my activity as Bali Food Blogger, and Daniel was also in Garuda Indonesia. Seize opportunities to meet with interesting people.

So our building management decided it's time to change the toilet paper dispenser in our toilets, replacing the previously black transparent casing with this solid ivory colored ones. What happens next, despite the name, is that the containers often ran out of papers. Something that almost never happened in the past. From the UX perspective the issue lies in lack of immediate information. In the past, users and janitors are able to see through the transparent casing, immediately noticing whether there's still enough paper supply left. However with the new non transparent design, that information is simply gone. From the service design perspective, it adds potential pain point in the user journey, in the form of users feeling disappointed, thus it can be seen as a service downgrade. #designfail #dontmakemethink #uxdesign

Gocart Racing Experience: pre-racing (1/3). So you want to have some fun with your co-workers doing a little gocart racing. - If you're thinking it will be fun, playful, and easy... or even think that gocart is just the faster version of boom boom car at theme park, you're in for a big surprise. - Just remember that some F1 racers were gocart racers, and treat it as part of their learning and preparation plan. - #gocarts #gocartracing #racingexperience #userexperience #uxdesign #3x1 #lifeatolxindo #lifeatolx #worklifebalance #officeouting #teamolx

Gocart Racing Experience: during racing (2/3). - 👉 Getting into/out of the vehicle require good flexibility and knowledge of where to/not to put your hands, as the engine (right beside your waist) tend to be burning hot after some while. - 👉 The speeding mechanism is minimalistic: a pedal pulls the wire to accelerate the engine, and when the setting is inaccurate your cart will speed up even when you don't step on the pedal - 👉 The steering wheel is much heavier than car's, hence you'd need to put extra power to make turns, which usually requires a whole body effort during high speed turns - 👉 You anticipate a turn instead of slowing down: take a wide angle on first turn so you'd be in good angle to enter the second turn, all with minimum breaking - 👉 You don't really turn, you're more likely to skid and drift - 👉 Steam and sweats will form inside your full face helmet, hindering your vision - 👉 Bumping into other racers is a part of the game, especially on thight turns, else you'd never advance your position. The vehicle is also designed to be bump save - 👉 By bumping I mean nudging, not full head-on collision, it's not boom boom car at theme parks - 👉 Suspension is nonexistent, the track is bumpy, the cart engine is rough, so don't expect a smooth ride - 👉 If you feel that everything is under control, that means you're not going fast enough #gocarts #gocartracing #racingexperience #userexperience #uxdesign #3x1 #lifeatolxindo #lifeatolx #worklifebalance #officeouting #teamolx

Gocart Racing Experience: afterward (3/3). - 👉 Frequent rehydration is a must since the races tend to be exhaustive - 👉 Pick your clothes wisely as daytime racing means extensive sunray, heat, and sweat - 👉 Expect to have a couple of crashes, both into the stack of tires, and into other racers - 👉 Be ready for sore muscles from all the struggles in handling your vehicle, some could last for days - 👉 It's a "Hell yeah!" kind of fun instead of a "Yippy" one #gocarts #gocartracing #racingexperience #userexperience #uxdesign #3x1 #lifeatolxindo #lifeatolx #worklifebalance #officeouting #teamolx

Among inconsistencies in buildings in Indonesia: the ground floor are either marked as 1st floor, or L (Lobby), or G (Ground), while the immediate one above are marked either 2nd floor, or sometimes 1st floor (in combination with G or L) as shown. Some also label it as UG (Upper Ground), and some treat it as in-between floor labeled as M (Mezzanine). To adds into complexity, most shopping mall and commercial buildings have no 4th floor, as number 4 (四; accounting 肆; pinyin sì) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese because it is nearly homophonous to the word "death" or "decease" (死 pinyin sǐ). Some building owners even take one step further by removing floor 14 as well, as it also contains 4. Last but not least, floor 13 is usually omitted as well due to the westerners belief it brings bad luck. So if you're office is on the Floor 15 in Indonesia, it could actually mean you're either on 14th, 13th, or 12th floor of the building. Rarely on actual 15th. #jinx #culturaldifference  #understandinguser #uxdesign #ux #localbeliefs

Getting ready for pa's first time ever surgery, following the condition which got him into hospitalization a couple of weeks earlier. On the positive side, the incident also triggers a full-family gathering, after about five years of absence due to me & my brother's different holiday schedule. Praying that everything works well. #familygathering

Usually the most interactive part of Design Thinking Workshop, sorting and grouping ideas requires participants to get bird-eye view of ideas they gather individually, and identify common themes. Afterward when there's still not enough unique ideas produced, rotating the groups around to examine and grow new ideas on top of other groups existing ones usually works. #designthinking #designsprint #cardsorting #uxworkshop #uxdesign #ideation #lifeatolx #lifeatolxindo #worklife #designworkshop #uxid

Going outdoor again after almost losing the drone last time at the nearby cliff. Even that it can stay afloat gracefully under moderate wind, turned out the drone's ditch is too shallow to overcome stronger ones, hence it's prone to get drifted away. Therefore practicing in wide open field with wind barriers (houses, walls, trees) and soft dry ground would be the best choice for early training. So far the drone has been dropped several times from varying heights, hitting furniture and bushes numerous times, also getting entangled in grasses and kite threads, yet it still rocks. Kudos for its endurance. Can't say much about video quality though. #dronepilot #symadrone #symax5uw #dronestagram #dronepilot #instamudik #EidMubarak #instalebaran #familygathering #dronetips

Among the early influencers that lead me to User Experience Design I believe is Richard Saul Wurman, the father of Information Architecture, which revolutionized the way designers design information. What's interesting about Wurman is that he approaches everyday problem through the eyes of common people, understanding their frustration, and then devise a simplified, structured way to present the solution. Wurman also inspires me to follow my curiosity, as he himself are a person with multiple interest, writing books on subjects he has no previous knowledge about, creating easy to understand and meaningful information as the result. He also found the TED conference, among others. #uxquote #understandinguser  #informationarchitecture #informationdesign #uxpeople #tedconference

Flashback to the OLX Asia Ops one year ago in Bali, which was also my second attempt at white water rafting in Ayung river. While I do enjoy the rafting part, the climbing down into, and climbing up from the river is a really challenging experience. The first time I did it my legs were shaking from climbing down the stairs, and I almost ran out of breath during climbing the almost vertical stairs back to the meeting point. The second time it was better as the climb back up wasn't so steep. So it turns out that we can choose where to end our trip. Lesson learned: Rafting demands some degree of physical fitness, it's not a leisure activity, and choose your rafting operator wisely. #rafting #ayungriver #balirafting #lifeatolxindo #teamolx #holidayexperience #baliadventure

Card Sorting using Post-it as skeleton of my "How Bloggers could Contribute to Tourism Destination Development"  presentation for Sampoerna School System and Ministry of Tourism Focus Group Discussion (FGD). It's more agile than using mindmapping software, especially with the large available space that enables you to quickly swith between helicopter and detailed view. #uxtools #cardsorting #brainstorming #mindmapping #kemenpar #sampoernaschoolsystem #akademigastronomiindonesia #pesonaindonesia

"Indonesia's problem is not the lack of funding, but on make things happen" said Ms. Bertine from World Bank (next to mbak @vitadatau). Something to ponder. #kemenpar #foodblogger #pesonaindonesia #10newbali #focusgroup #tourism #akademigastronomiindonesia

I just found out from a friend that Mesjid Salman ITB has published their own tafseer of the Holy Quran, and what makes it different is that it falls into the "ilmi" type of tafseer: interpretation that include scientific perspective. The book interpret just surahs from the final Juz, the 30th, as from the writers' perspective that's where most of ayats with scientific content existed. For me it would compliment the insights gained from "Percikan Sains dalam Al Quran" book by my father's colleague Pak Bambang Pranggono. Bought the e-book online from Google Books at 71.250 K IDR. Looking to purchase the physical version as well. #ramadan2017 #ramadanreading #tafseer #ebook

When I heard the news of my father's hospitalization, the first thing comes to my mind is how should I travel to Bandung from Tangerang, and since I reside 2 hours away from the train station then shuttle service is the most sensible option. Unfortunately it's been a while since my last time using this kind of service, so I don't have a clear idea of what is available, and which one is available near me. Painstakingly browsing through each provider's website (or the lack of it), I came across this aggregator plus online booking agent @TiketUX, which happen to facilitate most of the shuttle services. Out of curiosity I downloaded their Android app. While the app has up to date data and working ticketing system, the way it's designed doesn't enable user to compare schedules, as users need to choose the operator first. This way user need to repeatedly pick an operator, location, schedule, passenger data, to view the schedule, for each operator listed. Therefore the app doesn't really help in deciding which operator user should choose, which in my use case is the most painful stage. What would be great for TiketUX I believe is to change the order of the selection process (as illustrated), and it displays schedules from different operators as the result, so it behaves in the way similar to flight booking apps. The Select Passenger option should also moved to the last step of the process to help users get immediate result. What would be even greater is to use user's current location to provide nearby departure points, instead of choosing specific city, as users might have a closer location in the next city instead of on their own's. This is the case of users living in metropolitan cities, e.g.: living in Jabodetabek area. #uxreview #tiketux #usecase #uxdesign #uxid

Never seen father in this state,  but I guess there's no use to escalate the negative emotions, so instead I just try to humor him, as always. Get well soon pa.
