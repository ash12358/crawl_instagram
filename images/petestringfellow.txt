A huge shout out to an amazing sponsor of mine! The Leading Edge Salon in Santa Rosa, CA takes very good care of me doing exceptional work…very grateful for their support! Their staff is top-notch and their customer service is incredible. — I’m a dude, so naturally I’m “clueless” with this stuff. Luckily they are experts there and have men services that go beyond the haircut like straight edge shaving. On top of that, as soon as I get there they offer me a beer and a massage before we get started. #awesome - Please excuse the truck selfies … probably not the best way to show what they do. :P — Check them out online at http://leadingedgesalon.com/ — #salon #aveda #santarosa #sonomacounty #hairstylists #barber #mengrooming #sponsor

For the last few years, I’ve been coaching, mentoring, and co-managing an awesome, talented, young female country artist by the name of Dallas Caroline. I’m very excited and proud to see her show the world who she is and what she can do. Tune in tonight at 8/7c on NBC to see her blind audition on The Voice. — #thevoice #voiceblinds #teamdallas #sonomacounty #nbc #moretocome #justthebeginning

#tbt - Here's a Throwback Thursday post I just found out about. Let's just say, I should probably review my ASCAP royalty statements more often. Found out I have songs in these 2 network TV shows (The District & Clean House), and didn't realize it. Pretty surreal when you hear your music synced to popular movies and TV programs. This is new old news for me as well! #musicislife #tv #tvmusic #throwbackthursday #universalmusic #cleanhouse #thedistrict #musicpublishing

#tbt - Dreams do come true y’all! This is a couple photos from a session some years ago at Ocean Way Studios on Music Row in Nashville, TN. I remember growing up reading album credits on musicians who played on my favorite records from folks like George Strait, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw and Vince Gill. When I moved to Nashville, I dreamt of meeting these guys but as it turned out, I got to work with them on my songs on many occasions, and now they’re friends of mine. I never take their genius for granted, each one of these guys have album credits that read like phone books and are some of the best to have ever been recorded in Country music! Not only that, but they’re all genuine, gracious, fun to work with, and very humble.

I was cast in a pilot as one of the leads called AFTERWARDS - A post-apocalyptic western series coming in 2017 from writer/director Ryan Shiver (that cowboy character in the image is the character I'll be playing - although that's not me in the proof of concept). We've been doing rehearsals over the past few months, and having a blast! The cast is amazing, and I love the story...I mean, it's a western with Sci-Fi...my kind of flick! LOL! Excited to be a part of it all! We are now into the actions scenes and getting the choreography down (soon). All I can really say at the moment, but as soon as I can release more about the project, I most definitely will! #actor #film #pilot #series #scifi #western #action

Met this young lady yesterday at my next door neighbor's party, she's an accomplished actress with an impressive filmography. Her name is Diane Amos, and she's been the spokes person for Pine Sol for many years! Super sweet person and we discovered we both have the same agent! 😊 #actress #actorslife #newFriend #laborday

Just got back from a wonderful, well-needed family vacation! Got to hang with my awesome family, mom, my brothers (pictured here) with their families, my nephew and his family, and some friends! We were on Lake Shasta and stayed on a house boat (Holiday Harbor) and brought our ski boat to do some wake boarding, surfin', and tubing! Also fished, drank and ate a lot, swam and played some mean games of Texas Hold'em. It was a great time, and we had amazing weather the whole week! 😊☀️💦 #family #houseboating #watersports #fishing #lake #surfing

Had a great time as a judge for the 5-Min Film Festival last night! Great films were submitted, made our jobs difficult.

My band and I went out last night and saw my friend JD Simo perform in SF. #simo This kid is one of the best guitarists/artists out there, blowing minds everywhere they go!

#tbt - Me as a kid, chillaxin' on our Chevy truck with some fancy boots and my signature "Buddy Holly" glasses.  Loved this truck!

‪#‎tbt‬ - Here I am in pre-school during a choir concert (school/church is where the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts is now)...right after I decided to take the microphone and make a funny sound. I'm hard to miss, I'm the kid with the Buddy Holly glasses, looking mischievous in that groovy red outfit. All I remember from that day was the reaction of the audience, which as you could imagine was pretty awesome (I didn't even get into trouble). :) ‪#‎preschool‬ ‪#‎musicislife‬ ‪#‎singing‬ ‪#‎childhoodmemories‬

Studio floors are done! #stoked. When it comes to my music, I only hire the best and I made no exception with this crew (who have also done flooring in my CA home). Special thanks to my good friend Troy Tobon of TFC Flooring for rockin' it out today, the floors look (and sound) awesome!!!

Awww....the joys of remodeling a recording studio....getting new floors today with an additional layer of sound proofing, and then I get to start the re-wiring progress (which sucks but when it's done it'll be awesome). Excited to have it done by 2016!! #musicislife #music #recording #flooring

Something pretty cool about growing up down the road from where Star Wars is made. Our family hunting ranch was neighbors to the Skywalker ranch and I didn't know it until I was older. :-p.
