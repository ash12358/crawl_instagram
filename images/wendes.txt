Happy Earth Day! 🌎🌍🌏 Recently, I’ve started bringing a reusable cup when I buy myself a coffee. It feels really good doing little things like that to help protect our planet.  I challenge** you, my wonderful friends and family, to make one small & earth-friendly change to your life today. Bring reusable bags when you go shopping, use wash cloths instead of paper towels, buy your beer in a growler, get your Starbucks order made in a reusable cup. These little things reduce waste and help our little planet! (**plus, it’s actually not that challenging 😉)

Austin Marathon 2018. 3:13:10 PR. 9th female overall. But more importantly, surrounded by my favorite people in my favorite place!  I am overwhelmed by the support of my friends and family — the cheers (both 🍻 & 🎉), the text messages, the hours of travel, the amazing week in Austin.  I love all of y’all and am so glad I can share my crazy with you! 🙌🏼☺️❤️ My quads are still sore, but the 2019 race already looks very tempting...😬🏃🏼‍♀️#anyexcusetogotoaustin

In less than 3 weeks, I’ll be running my 4th Austin Marathon as part of the 2018 Elite Field. I’ve been training hard to lower my PR down towards that 3 hour barrier, and I’m both excited and anxious to race!  Learn more about it through the link in my bio 🏃🏼‍♀️

This weekend, I took a last minute trip back to Texas to run the Bandera 50K.  It was a whirlwind 48 hours and probably one of my crazier ideas (I blame #instagramlessZach). My flight landed in Austin @ 1 a.m. Saturday morning, and we slept for 2 hours in an HEB parking lot before getting to the trail in time for the 7:30 a.m. start.  I went out too hard in the first few miles (thanks adrenaline), spent a few miles cursing the rocks and sotol cacti that were tearing up my legs, and then rallied to a 2nd place finish!  It won't be a weekend I soon forget.  Thanks @tejastrails for a crazy ride! 🌵🏃🏼‍♀️🥈

Last Sunday, we ran down the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, crossed the Colorado River, weaved through that canyon there, and were up the North Rim by noon. Then we turned around and ran back!  All in a day’s work 😉 It’s okay what you’re thinking right now, our flight attendant thought we were crazy too...totally worth it ✌🏼 #r2r2r

Life lately.  I had a bad day at Twin Cities last month, which has turned into fuel for my next marathon.  Base building for a few more weeks and then kicking into full gear to take on the Austin Marathon next February.  And I’ve got big goals for my favorite race 😉🏃🏼‍♀️🤘🏼

The Zion Traverse — 50 miles in a single day.  Character building, to say the least. Or just plain crazy. Yeah, definitely that, too.

Bear with me, this will be a long one: Earlier this weak I heard news of the tragic passing of my dear friend Marc. I've been grieving him privately, still recovering from the shock, and while it feels beneath him to do this on social media, it's the best platform I have to share his impact on my life. We hadn't seen each other in a while, in fact I couldn't put a date on when I last spoke to him, but he was the kind of friend that you knew you would pick up with right where you left off the next time your paths crossed. Marc was sharp, darkly hilarious, and incredibly compassionate. I still have a post card on my fridge that he sent when he first moved to London...I reread it yesterday and it perfectly embodies him. I'll keep it forever. Marc was there for me to celebrate my mom's life after she passed. Months later his dad was diagnosed with a similar brain cancer, and I was one of the first people he told -- he was so worried about how that news would impact me after losing my mom, more worried about me than himself. That's just one amazing example of Marc's selflessness, even when he deserved to be incredibly selfish. When his dad passed, I joined Marc and his family in celebrating his life. Marc was so strong through that period, focused solely on providing for and taking care of his mother and sister. Those two strong woman have been at the top of my mind and the reason for my deepest pangs of grief these past two days. I remember after his dad passed, his mother asked me if it ever gets easier, if the pain ever lessens. Mrs. Nestinius, I stand by what I said then -- it doesn't get easier, but you do get stronger in bearing it. I wish so much I could help shoulder some of that pain for you and your daughter right now. I can't imaging what it's like to lose a son or a brother, but I hope you know that you are loved from all corners of this country and this world. Marc was an amazing friend, as many can attest to, and he will be sorely missed. I will be there in spirit celebrating his life this weekend, somewhere beautiful and adventurous and with people I love, which I know he would appreciate. Here's to you, Marc, gone far too soon. RIP.

I love this photo, because it features my squad. I couldn't have gotten this far without all the support from my wonderful friends and family. I qualified for Boston just after the 2017 cutoff, so no race for me this year...but I still felt the love from all the texts wondering why I wasn't running today ❤️ Congrats to all of Boston 2017 runners! Y'all have me inspired and stoked for Boston 2018, come hell or high water!

As of this morning, I have officially covered every step of the ~30+ miles of Wildwood Trail. I feel weirdly sentimental thinking about the first time I stepped foot on this trail. I was a car-less intern that decided one Friday to take the MAX to Washington Park after work. I had on ballet flats, and I walked and walked and walked until I finally reached Pittock Mansion. My shoes were destroyed, but my love for this trail was ignited. Since then, I've slowly ticked off additional sections of the Wildwood, jumping over fallen trees, trekking through mud and snow, pausing for pictures of slugs and trilliums and the light gleaming perfectly between the trees. Today, I covered that final remaining stretch between Firelane 1 and Hardesty Trail, as a different person from the girl who started this journey 5 years ago. Honestly, thank god that 21-year old didn't get the life she thought she wanted back then, because the life I've got now is so much better than that 😊 Next step: Cover the entire Wildwood Trail in one day ✌🏼🏃🏼‍♀️💁🏼

This morning I got my revenge on the Austin Marathon -- and boy did it fight back, humid mile after humid mile. I managed a nice PR and might have even snuck into the top 15 women overall. But the best part was all the support from friends & family, near & far!  I appreciate you all so much, every text, every hug, every snap. Y'all are my inspiration to keep pushing and keep setting big goals ❤😊🙌🏼🏃🏼‍♀️

If you had asked me at the beginning of the year, I would have said this was impossible. I could hardly fathom holding an 8 min/mile pace for any distance, and today I dipped into the 6:xxs at the Holiday Half Marathon!  The time on my watch is the best proof I can offer that our limiting beliefs are bullshit & that we can do anything we set our minds to. I for one can't wait to see what 2017 has in store...you can bet I'm coming up with some crazy goals for the new year 😊💪🏼🏃🏼‍♀️

I feel so grateful for all the great running trails, running weather and running opportunities available in Oregon. From Hood to Coast to miles and miles of trails, it's easily one of the best parts about living up here (closely followed by the wine, of course). Today's run started with this view, and I'm pretty content about it 😊

Legs-up-the-wall for days! Well y'all, I didn't run the race I'd hoped for today...it happens. You start out strong and then hit that unexplainable wall. But I'm not sad, or even mad like I thought I'd be. I know my body is capable of running a BQ time, and I'm no quitter. First, I'm going to take a brief hiatus from running to focus on some different fun. Like getting back to soccer & learning to golf & SUP at the lake & hey, who wants to go camping!?...okay you get the idea. Then I'll be back at it, wiser/stronger/ready to kill it 👊🏼🙌🏼💪🏼 But first first, cerveza!

It's "flat lay" official, tomorrow I'm running the Eugene Marathon! I'm foam rolling and carbo-loading and thinking sub-3:30 thoughts 😁 You can track my splits on the eugenemarathon.com homepage. Just enter my bib #: 1689. Thank y'all for all the amazing support! ❤️

"When you walk, one foot is always on the ground. When you run, most of the time you are actually airborne. For example: a 6-foot-tall runner with feet about 1 foot long was found to take 1,250 steps while running 8-minute miles. Thus, while covering 1 mile—5,280 feet—he was in touch with the ground for 1,250 feet and airborne for 4,030 feet. Put another way, he was in the air for 76% of the time. So don’t think of it as a 10-mile run. Think of it as 7 miles of flying." -Paul E. Richardson

Tapering is THE WORST. There are less than two weeks until the Eugene Marathon aka my Boston qualifying attempt. At this point, I've done as much as I can do to build up the speed and endurance for a sub-3:35 time. All that's left is to rest and mentally prepare and to breathe.  Which is so much harder than it sounds! Tapering brings up so many unfounded worries and doubts, and you have to remind yourself that failure is not the end of the world. Que sera sera. I'm ready for the worst and hoping for the best. I'm ready. I'm just plain ready. This marathon is the closing of a chapter, and for better or for worse I am so, so ready.

We officially survived our road trip around Ireland! Dropped off our rental car this afternoon and now we are enjoying one final night in Dublin.

Forest Park seemed extra green today. All 19 miles of it (3 of which were accidental...oops). I've officially signed up for the Eugene Marathon -- and y'all, my goal is to run a Boston Qualifying time. I hear there's something to making your goals public, so I'm putting it out there. That means running a sub-3:35 marathon, aka a 8:12 min/mile pace for 26.2 miles. It's going to be tough, but I think I can do it 💪🏼

It's been a roller coaster of a day, and I'm so thankful to have my dad and brothers getting me through it (from 2000 miles away, no less). I rode in my first bicycling event ever, appropriately named the Worst Day of the Year Ride. I was super intimidated from the second I showed up -- I felt inadequate next to the seasoned riders & their speedy road bikes. I was ready to quit before I even started, but a quick phone call with my dad was enough to keep me from loading my bike back into my car. Just a few minutes into the ride, I realized all my fears were unfounded, and for 20 miles I easily kept up with/out-climbed many of the veteran riders. They even joked that I must have a motor hidden in my bike, because I was making it look easy. I felt great!  But then the downhill came, and I took a turn too quickly that sent me flying off the bike. Injuring my pride, shocking my shoulder and leaving welts and road rash down the left side of my body...yet thankfully I was okay. I got back up and back on the bike, and I finished the 42-mile ride. Now I'm sore, stiff & swollen, but proud that I overcame my fears and crossed that starting line. And then crossed that finish line, too. More phone calls with my dad have followed, reassuring me that I will recover, that it might take time, that it isn't the end of the world, and that R.I.C.E is my best friend. So here I am with an ice pack on my shoulder and the hope of a quick recovery. It's all gonna be okay y'all 👌🏼

A half-marathon PR (1:44:28) and a New Year's resolution crossed off (run a sub-1:45 half). All on a solo training run! I'm feeling damn good about my next race 💪🏼👊🏼🙌🏼 Good luck to my friends and family running Austin tomorrow -- y'all are gonna kill it! ❤️

I wish I could convey just how caked in mud my legs were after this run.  It was splattered all up the back of my calves.  And my ponytail was basically in dreadlocks from all the moisture. Yuck! Running certainly isn't glamorous, but it's so rewarding if you let it be. I think that could be said about most of the best things in life, am I right? 😉

The sun came out today and I was grinning the whole way home.  It's been dark, dreary and cold for weeks, scratch that, months. I'm told this what a real Oregon winter is like, and man is it tough for a Texas girl. But the sun came out today, and it was warm and bright and good. I'm feeling hopeful, and I couldn't help but smile as I flew down the final hill home. Maybe I'm too optimistic -- there's plenty more rain predicted for next week and onward -- but I've started hearing birds singing in the morning again, and I'm hopeful that spring is coming soon! 🌞

In 2016, I want to try gymnastics, boxing, and tennis.  I want to go camping more. And I want to run a sub-1:45 half marathon!  2015 was a great year, from Amsterdam to Vancouver to Alaska to Austin to Yosemite to the Portland Marathon, and I have a really good feeling about this coming year. 2016, I'm ready for you! 😊 #betterforit

Growing up in Texas, I thought rainforests were only in places like South America and Asia. Exotic and strange, humid and hot, wild and dangerous. But now I run beside 100-ft trees and canyons of ferns & it rains all the time, and I'm finally realizing that by moving to the PNW, I've moved to the rainforest. It's not what I always pictured, I knew too little to understand what I read in textbooks. Which is why I'm glad I moved so far from home after college. It's why I'm thankful for my travels. I have such a different perspective and understanding of the world since leaving home. I've learned plenty about myself & my happiness, lessons that wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise. Books feel more real when I read them. I'm more skeptical, but in a good way. I question everything, I don't accept the reasoning that "that's just how it's done," I realize that just because everyone else is doing something that doesn't mean it's right for me. I now do things differently than the people from back home, and I still do things differently than the people here. Here in the rainforest, where everything has changed.

Today, we drank Pinot in Utopia 👌🏼 No really, there's a vineyard in the Willamette Valley called Utopia, and it is awesome! Go there, and take me with you.

From a run with Maggie earlier this week. We try to do a mile around this reservoir every morning, no matter what, and the promise of fog and colorful leaves help us get out of bed these days. (Okay, it helps me get out of bed, Maggie doesn't need to be persuaded...)

I couldn't be more excited about my 3:55:33 marathon run today! Recently, I started feeling like I had something to prove in the 26.2 mile race. After a few blow ups in the past when I've run this distance, I didn't feel like my times represented what I'm capable of. So when the opportunity arose to sign up for the Portland Marathon, I went for it. And now I have sub-4 hour PR that I can be proud of!! And boy do I feel proud right now 😎 That's pretty much all I can feel because my legs are practically numb after all those miles -- I think I'll stick with half marathons for awhile... 😉

At 1:30 PM yesterday, Van 1 of Team Vine Maple Savages kicked things off at Mt Hood. 22 Hours, 34 Minutes & 46 Seconds later, we crossed the finish line in Seaside, Oregon! I couldn't have asked for a more inspiring team and van -- we made it through the hills, the thunder, the lightning, the wind storms, and finished 30th overall. It's been another crazy, successful Hood To Coast relay, and I can't wait to do it again next year!
