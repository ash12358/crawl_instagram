sometimes not-so-great, unforeseen circumstances (my car not starting) lead to great, unforeseen circumstances (having lunch with husband + spending extra time with jackson). it’s all about mindset. 🌸

how can a year be the hardest of my life while simultaneously being the best year of my life? it’s simple: motherhood. i look back at the hard + difficult, happy + joyous moments and see Jesus in every single one. it was a year of redemption for me. // happy birthday, jackson! you have filled our lives with so much joy + laughter. (also- HOW IS MY BABY ONE? send all the birthday cake, please. 😭) #jacksonkeimig

a happy list:  the joy of dogs when they’re riding in a car with their heads hanging out of the window. pausing to marvel a stunning sunset. night swimming under the stars. black nail polish. baby giggles. ending the day with a good book. wildflowers.

after receiving an offer less than 24 hours after listing last month, our house is officially sold! while we never intended to buy + sell that house after only ten months (another house became available that we couldn't refuse), i am still thankful for the time we spent there. that season of life is one of redemption + grace as i navigated the newness of motherhood. i am really excited to make our new house a home with my boys. 🖤

thoughts from the weekend. - we are FINALLY finished moving + our house goes on the market this week. it’s crazy to do this just eight months after buying the house, but the end result will be the best for our family. - we had jackson’s dedication at church yesterday. our families were there, and it was really special. more than i hope for him to find a good career or a godly wife someday, my biggest prayer is that he lives wholly + fully for Jesus. - someone asked if my niece was my sister, and she’s half my age. not gonna lie, it made me feel really good 💁🏼‍♀️. - jackson turns one next month, and i’m having some major feelings about it. - dairy queen’s peanut butter cookie dough blizzard is 🔥. - there are so many perks to living with my sister-in-law. like right now- i’m chillin’ on their deck + sitting next to their pool thinking about how tan i’m gonna be this summer. (yeah right. i’m so pale i make edward cullen look tan. 😂)

as the plane took off, i gripped his arm so tightly that he looked at me with wide eyes. "are you scared?" he asked. "i'm terrified of planes." i replied. . he didn't know that about me. granted there was a lot he didn't yet know about me. we had only known each other for two months before boarding that plane for las vegas. most people would freak out because they were about to commit their life to a person they'd only known for sixty days, but there i was - losing my mind over the fact that every single bit of turbulence meant we were probably crashing to our deaths. . it's been three years since we eloped. three years of choosing him every single day. three years of loving him - all the parts of him. even his messiness. i'm like FEMA cleaning the house after hurricane jared. . one thousand ninety-six days of marriage. i've learned so much about him. about me. about us. he loved me through the hardest month of my life after our son was born. he makes me coffee every morning. he makes up jingles for eeeeeverything. i could list all the things and all the ways he's loved me, but i would be writing for days. . i love you, babe. thank you for choosing me. 🖤

THREE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW . - jared asked me to marry him three years ago yesterday. it’s so wild to me. i remember trying to make wedding plans that week, and we joked that we should just elope in vegas. (but that would be crazy, right?! 😉) - i took jackson outside for a little bit earlier. i played some worship music + watched him giggle and look around at the trees. i’ve had a crappy week at work, and this moment was really good for my soul. - there’s a new poll in my stories about march madness!

// i was recently listening to an episode of @thepopcast about misheard lyrics. i was cry-laughing as i listened because i am THE WORST at this - just ask jared! my best misheard lyric is from the song “nobody knows it but me” by tony rich. #90sforever the lyric is: the nights are lonely, the days are so sad. i always sang: the nights are lonely, and Jesus is sad. 😂 what’s your funny misheard lyric?

funny story [which has nothing to do with this picture. i just like it. 🤷🏼‍♀️] - i was walking through walmart last week when an older woman stopped me to take a peek at jackson. she was cute, and jack smiled + cooed at her. as i started to walk away, she says to me, “oh, i just wanna squeeze her.” . . . 😜 maybe she was confused by the dinosaur shirt, black + green pants, and the blue swaddle? 😂

yesterday, i noticed these random blooms in the target parking lot. [yes, in october!] wildflowers have always been a love language between the Lord + i. they seem to pop up in the most random of places- His way of wooing me + reminding me that He is always with me. [even at target 😂]

on this day - one year ago - i was driving home from work when i decided i should probably take a pregnancy test. i was sure it would be negative. as i put the cap back on the test, i caught a small glance. it was already positive. WHAT?! i let out a small laugh + sat there for a solid ten minutes thinking, WHAT the WHAAAT? i had asked jared to take out a mouse trap, and i could hear him in there, flabbergasted, because there were three mice on the trap. i’m all: what i have to show you is crazier! he started calling for me to come look, and i told him to come to the bathroom really quick. as he walked up to me, all i could do was smile. he got excited + asked me if i was pregnant. YES! he grabbed me in a big hug, and it was such a sweet moment. a couple minutes later, he turns to me and says, “did you hear that we caught three mice on one trap?” 😂😂😂

jared + i took a walk around my parents’ property when we visited them last weekend. if you’ve been following me for a while, you know my love [aka: obsession] with this tree. my grandma gracie planted it years + years ago. and while she went to be with Jesus almost two decades ago, pieces of her are still apart of me today. i want to do the same for my son. #pineconejewels

i am super grateful for a God who meets me right where i am - in the middle of my beautiful/crazy/hard/hilarious mess. motherhood (and life in general lately) has humbled me in ways i never thought possible. but i'm just crazy grateful for what the Lord is doing in my life right now. [and for almond milk lattes. 😂☕️]

i love this little boy so much. i post all the cute photos of him because- duh, he's stinkin' adorable. but what you don't see are the tears - from both of us - the frustration, the exhaustion, and all the things that come with having a newborn. motherhood is the hardest thing i have ever done. it's a mixture of pure joy [[one smile from him and i'm a sappy mess]] + #momguilt about everything [[like tonight- when i had a babysitter for two and a half hours. instead of enjoying it in the beginning, i strolled the aisles of target while tears filled my eyes because i felt guilty for needing a break. i love my son, but for my sanity, i need some me time.]] + wondering if i'm doing anything right. [[half the time, i'm just winging it.]] but it's worth every single tear + smile + everything in between. 🖤

38 weeks // we are patiently waiting for baby boy to arrive. [even #milothelovepup is excited!] i'm only dilated a half a centimeter, so it doesn't look like he's coming anytime soon. 😂i sat in his nursery last night and worshipped the Lord for awhile. i know that my God is faithful to provide + He is in the details, so i'm soaking in these moments + taking it all in every day. 🖤

the last week of the year is always one of reflection for me. 2016 was filled with good + bad, highs + lows - just like the last thirty years of my life. i had lots of health issues in the beginning, rough days at work, and everyday stresses. BUT GOD. the overriding theme of this entire year [and my life, really] is this: He was faithful through it all. just like He always is, always has been, and always will be. this next year, i will become a mama. oh, mylanta. y'all. what a crazy-beautiful life this is. bring on 2017!

// #fridayintroductions // . hey, y'all! i'm amber. wild worshipper. #wildbloomblog writer. wildflower seeker. . photography is part of who i am - running deep in my bones + fueling the creativity on a daily basis. you'll probably always find a cup of coffee in my hand, too - which was probably hand-crafted by a really handsome bass player i married a year + a half ago. . now i'm off to work at a job i love. [bookeeper, holla!] i'm excited for a weekend full of lattes, naps, netflix, cuddling, and reading.

today is my thirtieth birthday! as i look back on my twenties full of ups + downs + in-betweens, highs + lows, laughter + tears, joy + sorrow, i am so incredibly thankful. God takes broken things and makes them beautiful- i'm living proof. what a crazy-beautiful life this is. "You did it: you changed wild lament into whirling dance; You ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers. i’m about to burst with song; i can’t keep quiet about You. God, my God, i can’t thank you enough." [psalm 30:11-12 // msg]

i moved to wichita in march of twenty-fifteen. jared and i were newly married, and i was living in a new city/state - far outside my small-town oklahoma comfort zone. with all of its charm, i knew this city had depth + stories to tell + adventures for me. i've been an official resident for over a year now, and i often get asked if i'm liking it - to which i reply: I LOVE IT! most people who have lived here for awhile ask me - often with confused looks - why? #wichitacollective is my answer to that question. i want to share the places + spaces that make wichita great: coffee shops [obviously], locally owned restaurants + businesses, landmarks, etc. my intention is to meet new people and listen to their stories and make friends. and of course, drink lots of great coffee in the process!

after three weeks of sickness + testing + pain, i am finally starting to feel like myself again. it was revealed that i have a cyst on my ovary and another little area that required further testing, but i am on my way to healing. here's how i know: six months ago, i noticed a lump. i went in for testing, and a tumor was discovered. it measured on the larger side, so i was referred to a surgeon, but i never went to the appointment. i started a new job and promised jared that i would get it checked again after tax season. the month leading up to the ultrasound was filled with prayers. as i laid on the table last week, the ultrasound tech seemed confused. she even brought in the resident to take a look. i smiled with tears in my eyes. he was baffled. why? IT WAS GONE. praise God! He is Jehovah Rapha - the Lord our Healer! so you see, these other issues that i have in my body - i am confident that He will bring healing. He will work everything for my good and His glory.

today is wonderful, for no particular reason, really. there is breath in my lungs. the sun is shining. the One who created me walks with me each step of the day and loves me in all the moments (as big/mundane/crazy/beautiful/small as they may be). it's just a great day, friends, because i choose to make it so.
