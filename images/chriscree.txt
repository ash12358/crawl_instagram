Jesus said there's a spiritual harvest out there that's ready and ripe. It's just waiting to be brought in. But it takes a lot of work to bring that harvest in. You can ask any farmer. There's way more work at harvest time than there is at planting time. It takes far more effort to disciple someone in the ways of the Kingdom of God than it does to plant a spiritual seed in their lives about the Kingdom. Will you choose to pray today that God will send laborers out into the field to reap a harvest of disciples? Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few." — Matthew 9:37 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #harvest #work

Jesus said that his yoke is easy and his burden is light. Yet when you talk to most Christians they'll tell you life is very heavy and hard. So many are dealing with burnout and depression, even those in ministry. This doesn't line up with what Jesus promises, so something's wrong with this picture. Burnout is a symptom that we are doing things in our own strength instead of relying on the Holy Spirit and His direction. If you feel burned out today, talk with God about it. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you where you need to make adjustments to lighten your load and get back to your place of productive rest. If you let Him, the Holy Spirit burns out burnout. He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water. — John 7:38 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #spirit #rest

Most Christians feel like they are doing well to believe God for just enough, just in time, survival provision. Those stories make for emotionally compelling testimonies. Unfortunately survival provision leads to selfishness because you cannot give away what you do not have. God is able to do far and above even the biggest, most decadent things we can imagine. Therefore He is certainly capable of providing enough for our needs plus extra for us to give away and bless others. God longs to be your more than enough, in advance, double portion provider. Why not start believing for enough and extra so you can be more of a blessing to others around you? Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we ask or imagine, according to the power that works in us — Ephesians 3:20 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #prayer #enough

Thankfulness is a sign of humility. Being thankful is one of the best ways to keep selfishness and self-centeredness from entering into your life. A thankful heart recognizes and is grateful for the contributions of others. Thanking God for what He does in your life and on your behalf is the perfect starting place for worship. That's why thankfulness opens the door to the spiritual realm like nothing else. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. — 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #thankfulness

God gave Jesus the nations for his inheritance. As believers, we are now Christ's body here on Earth until Jesus returns in person. Unfortunately though, we have pretty much abandoned nearly all the available territory in massive swaths of our culture. If God's people won't occupy the high ground in the nations promised to Jesus, then Satan's people are more than happy to fill that void. Instead of occupying what is rightfully ours, we now find ourselves marginalized, ineffective, and our perspective is perceived as mostly irrelevant. You are called to be salt and light. What are some ways you can make a difference to the world around you today? I will declare the Lord’s decree: He said to Me, “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father. Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance and the ends of the earth Your possession." — Psalms 2:7-8 (HCSB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #nations #occupy

We are told multiple times in the Bible to be like God. We can do that because we have been adopted into the family of God. He is now our true Father. He loves us totally and unconditionally. As children of God we can respond in the ways that God would respond because that is our identity in Christ. Children imitate their fathers. Since you are dearly loved by God, you can imitate him without fear. That's who you are now as a believer. Learn how much God loves you, and learn God's ways. As you learn, determine in your heart to walk in those ways of God. Being a child in this way in Heaven will make you mature here on Earth. Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children. — Ephesians 5:1 (HCSB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #children #mature

Seeds always contain power to produce after their kind. Always. We can ignorantly plant negative seeds in our lives that produce a harvest of corruption and misery. Or we can plant positivity seeds that produce life and abundance. Sometimes the seeds we plant lay dormant waiting on the right environment to grow. But do not be deceived. The seeds you plant in your life still contain power. They are just waiting for the right faith conditions to start growing. Commit today to planting good seed. Tend that crop. Water it with the Word of Truth. Build your faith by meditating on the Word and on God's promises. Believe for your harvest and watch the law of sowing and reaping start producing a good harvest in your life. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked [He will not allow Himself to be ridiculed, nor treated with contempt nor allow His precepts to be scornfully set aside]; for whatever a man sows, this and this only is what he will reap. — Galatians 6:7 (AMP) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #seed #power

God has ALREADY given us everything we need that pertains to life, past tense. It comes through the knowledge of God. So if we have lack in any area of our lives — whether it's sickness, broken relationships, financial lack, whatever — we have a knowledge problem. That lack is a result of us not knowing God well enough in that area. All it takes is one moment of revelation knowledge regarding a specific facet of the character and nature of God and what he has already done for you in that area to solve whatever problem you are facing in your life today. His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and excellence — 2 Peter 1:3 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #provision #solutions

Some people abuse God's grace as license to do whatever they want. They mistakenly think that because Jesus came to set us free, that they are therefore free to rebel and live selfishly without consequence. However, we would do well to learn from King David whom the Bible says was a man after God's own heart. David had multiple opportunities to take matters into his own hands, kill King Saul, and assume the throne that was rightfully his after Samuel anointed him. But David refused to take any action to advance himself in his own strength. Instead, he waited for God to promote him. And that's exactly what God did in the course of time. Sometimes God presents us with opportunities to grasp what He promises to see if we will be humble enough to wait for God to promote us. David passed that test. Will you? Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time — 1 Peter 5:6 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #freedom #choices

Jesus set us free. The problem is that so many of his followers don't know it. They go back to all the rules and regulations, all the dos and don'ts, and think that somehow makes them better. You truly are free in Christ. That freedom you now have comes with responsibility. You can choose whatever you want. However, you do not get to choose the consequences of your choice. Those consequences are tied to your choices. Therefore exercise your freedom responsibly. Choose wisely. Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. — Galatians 5:1 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #freedom #responsibility

God looks at our attitude when we give as much as our gift itself. This was the reason Cain's offering was rejected. Genesis 4:3 says that "in the process of time" Cain brought an offering to God. He made his offering eventually, when he got around to it, from the leftovers. In contrast, verse 4 says Abel brought the "firstborn of his flock". Abel prioritized God first and brought his best. Able put God first and his offering was accepted. "Seek first the Kingdom of God..." Cain didn't. Cain was selfish and put himself first. God was an afterthought. Let your giving flow freely and cheerfully from the overflow of your love for God and your love for others. Then God will always be well pleased with your gifts. Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion. for God loves a cheerful giver. — 2 Corinthians 9:7 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #giving #attitude

Some people think faith is about denying the facts of a situation. But true faith has no problem acknowledging the facts because those with understanding know that truth trumps facts. Therefore they exalt the truth, regardless of the current facts they see. Truth simply is. Otherwise it wouldn't be truth. Therefore when we see facts that conflict with the Word of God and don't line up with what we know to be true, we can trust the truth to overrule those facts we see and have more power. It's the same way the aerodynamic forces of lift and thrust can seemingly overrule the law of gravity to allow an airplane to fly. When you know that you know that you know truth like that to the point where even conflicting facts can't keep you from it, that is when you experience genuine freedom. Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” — John 8:31-32 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #truth #freedom

In many ways the Kingdom of God is exactly backwards from the world's way of doing things. The world is impressed by big cash donations. However, in God's Kingdom, He looks at things proportionally where giving is concerned. God measures the size of an offering based on the percentage of what the person has, not on the cash value of the gift. And God will never ask you to give more than you have because God will not put you in debt from an offering. Don't let someone manipulate you into giving foolishly. Instead let all your offerings flow directly out of your relationship with God. And expect Him to bless and prosper your generosity. For if there is a willing mind first, the gift is accepted according to what a man possesses and not according to what he does not possess. — 2 Corinthians 8:12 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #offerings #generosity

Many people struggle to find balance in their lives between their jobs, family, relationship with God, and so on. But that's the wrong goal. Instead of striving for balance we should put these things in proper order. The Bible teaches clear priorities in our lives. Our relationship with God should be first, then our husband or wife, and then our children. Our job or ministry should be prioritized in order below all that. When order things according to God's priorities, we will experience the peace that balance promises, but never quite actually delivers. God is the God of order, not chaos. Let all things be done decently and in order. — 1 Corinthians 14:40 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #order #priorities

Jesus said, “no one puts new wine into old wineskins.” We must mix the new wine of revelation from God with the new wineskin of our faith in order for it to be effective in our lives. Just hearing, or even agreeing with God's word is not enough. We need to believe that word from God and act on it in faith. Until we do, that word will have little impact on our lives. But once a word from God becomes revelation to your heart and you act on it in faith, that word has the potential to sort out anything in your life amazingly fast. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. — Luke 5:37 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #wineskin #faith

Faith takes time and is usually built up in stages. The experience of believing for and receiving God's promises in small things gives us the confidence in His word to believe the promises for bigger things. We build our faith through exercise in a way similar to how we build our physical muscles. If you are having trouble receiving a big miracle, perhaps you can find something a bit smaller to believe God for first. The effectiveness of your faith in the smaller thing will build confidence and strengthen your faith to more easily receive the bigger thing. Remember, it is through faith and patience that we receive the promises of God. Therefore, since we are encompassed with such a great cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. — Hebrews 12:1 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #faith #strength

God is ever vigilant and aways on duty. You can rest knowing that God is watching out for you. As a believer, His blessing of protection is always in force on your behalf. Therefore you no longer have any need to worry about what might happen. Let go of that stress. Enjoy the supernatural peace and rest that comes from knowing God is your shield and your strong tower. He is your refuge in times of trouble and your constant source of peace. Your responsibility is simply to abide in Him and trust Him to do what he promises on your behalf.

Shortcuts are not from God. The results of shortcuts won't last. Lottery winners end up in far worse financial shape within a few short years of winning large sums of money. It's far better to invest the time and effort to learn God's ways of doing things. God rewards and blesses those who faithfully walk in his ways. Faithfully walking in God's blessing avoids the kinds of crisis that require miracles to deliver us from. Set your heart on the path of faithfulness today.

You can get wealthy both in the world's Mammon system or in the Kingdom of God though God's blessings. One of the many differences is the baggage that comes with that wealth. The world's Mammon system is cursed. So wealth gained by that system comes with baggage like selfishness, greed, isolation, disappointment, damaged relationships, regret, insignificance, despair, and the list goes on. This is why so many wealthy people who are successful by the world's standard commit suicide. However, wealth gained by the blessing of God in His Kingdom has none of that baggage whatsoever. The Bible is clear. There is no sorrow that comes with godly wealth.

The best way to go through life is trusting God and live in the shadow of the Almighty. Jesus called this abiding in him. As we do this more, we learn to walk in the ways of God. And this is where God promises to order His angels to protect us in all our ways. That means you can have confidence when you are following God. Trusting God and the promises he put in his Word for you puts you in a place to receive supernatural angelic protection.

God's grace has already made a perfect provision for your every need. It's there waiting for you in the Kingdom of God. This is why Jesus said we are to seek first the Kingdom of God and then everything we need will be added to us (Matthew 6:33). Do you have a need in your health, your relationships, or your finances? Is there some habit or addiction that controls you? God's grace has already supplied what you need to overcome that obstacle in your life. That supply is in his Kingdom, waiting for you to receive. You must learn the ways of the Kingdom of God so you can receive those things God has reserved just for you.

When we focus on Jesus, on what he accomplished for us with his death and resurrection, and on the promises of God that are now available to us as a result, then the obstacles in our lives will shrink to insignificance. Jesus is the one who started our faith. And he's the one who will finish it. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Trust God. Focus in on what God promises in the Bible. The more you do that, the less intimidating the obstacles that rise up in your life will be. If you keep at it, before long you will find yourself consistently overcoming things that overwhelm others.

People have a tendency to attribute all kinds of horrible, evil things to God. But that's not who God is. James tells us that God provides every good gift and every perfect gift. He doesn't give us hurtful or destructive "gifts". Since God is unchanging by his very nature, he is indeed good all the time. All that bad junk in your life? That's not from God. It's the enemy trying to destroy your soul and poison your relationship with God. Resist the enemy's bad stuff. Submit to God's good stuff. Taste and see how good God is.

Hearing God clearly can be a big challenge for some believers. Part of the challenge is that when they do hear a personal word from God for some direction, there does not seem to be any practical way to move that way because the provision for it isn't visible. Every vision needs some pro to see it come to life, as in pro-vision. Know this. Where God guides, he will provide. If you are truly on His assignment, then it is His responsibility to provide the resources you need to carry out that assignment. Your part is to continue seeking God and his ways to find where or how he intends to get that provision to you. It's there somewhere, hidden for you, not hidden from you. The Lord will guide you continually, giving you water when you are dry and restoring your strength. You will be like a well-watered garden, like an ever-flowing spring. — Isaiah 58:11 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #guidance #provision

One of the reasons we get so overwhelmed by the problems and obstacles in front of us is that we assume we have to conquer them with our own limited resources and abilities. The good news is that when we are following God and working in his assignment, he will fight those impossible battles for us. God longs to show himself strong on your behalf. Just be loyal to God. Trust him. And then watch him fight your battles for you. That way God gets all the glory and you get the blessing of the victory!

The Bible exhorts us to be thankful in everything. Unfortunately some folks misunderstand that to mean we are to be thankful for everything that happens in our lives. But it's not the same thing. Bad things happen to all of us. Yet even in those bad situations, there are always going to be little sparks of light that we can be thankful for. They may be hard to see at fist. But as you build a habit of looking for the good in your situations, you will find it easier and easier. Focusing on the good will, in turn, bring more peace into your life just like Paul explains in Philippians 4:8-9. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. — 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #thankfulness

Worry is based in fear. It is nothing more than meditating about possible negative outcomes, and all the bad things that might happen. But here's the thing. Hardly any of those bad things we worry about every actually happen. Faith is the opposite of fear. You will do so much better to choose the path of faith. Instead of worrying about the bad stuff that might happen, try meditating about a promise that God made in his Word. Find one that relates to your situation. Think on it. Ponder it. Consider other Bible verses related to it. Not only will that get you operating in faith instead of fear, but that's exactly how you begin to truly start seeking the Kingdom of God and His righteousness! But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you. Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. — Matthew 6:33-34 (HCSB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #worry #faith

You were not created to be able to handle the stress of worrying. It eats away at your physical body. Instead of losing sleep worrying, pass all that stuff along to God and let him deal with it. Trust God to work all things out for your good. Allow his supernatural peace to come into your soul. And then, enjoy a good night's sleep! Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 4:6-7 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #worry #prayer #peace

God's ways of doing things are very different from man's ways. But God's ways are perfect. We do well to learn God's ways and then move in them. You can discover those ways of God in his Word, the Bible. And his Word has been proven to be trustworthy and true down through the ages. No matter what you are going through right now, applying God's ways to your situation will improve things for you. Consume his Word. Seek his ways. Allow God himself to become your shield. As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him. — Psalms 18:30 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #ways #perfect

The Kingdom of God is exactly backwards from the world's system when it comes to the area os strength. In the world, strength is all about power, and the ability to control and dominate others. In the Kingdom of God, the joy of the Lord is your strength. It is only in Christ that you experience the world overcoming strength you need to accomplish your God assignment. And that strength starts as you experience Joy in your intimate association with God through Jesus. Make a decision to enter into joy today and watch your godly strength increase as you do! Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet drink, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” — Nehemiah 8:10 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #joy #strength

God is love and gives everyone freedom to chose what to do. At the same time, God does not give anyone freedom to chose the consequences of their actions. Consequences are tied directly to our actions by the universal law of planting and harvesting, also called sowing and reaping. God himself put that law into place, just like he put the law of gravity in place. You will harvest what you plant. Full stop. The harvest you have today is from the seed you planted during your yesterdays. The only way to get a better harvest tomorrow is to start planting better seed today. Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. — Galatians 6:7 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #SpritualLaw #plant #harvest

The Bible is the greatest love story of all time. It's the story of God patiently and passionately wooing the bride who betrayed him across millennia. Not only did mankind turn their collective backs on God in the Garden of Eden, but each of us individually was far from God at one time too. Fortunately God's love is so enduring that he provided a way for us to return to him through his son Jesus. God's love for you is so big that you can now live and make your home right there in the midst of it. You don't need a magnifying glass to find God's love in the Bible. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him. — 1 John 4:16 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #Jesus #love

God is the most generous person in the universe. As a follower of Jesus you are a child of God. That means you have the Father's DNA and have that same kind of generosity planted inside you, waiting to be released. That generosity can take many forms. For example, you can be generous in love, your rime, forgiveness, service, and yes, even with your money. Every time you do something real to bless someone else, you are expressing the generosity of God, your Father. For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you. Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God. — 2 Corinthians 9:10-11 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #generosity #giving

If you are having trouble hearing God, you would do well to slow down, get quiet, and momentarily rise above whatever chaos is swirling around you. Jesus repeatedly drew away from the masses to solitary places for time alone with the Father. Since it was important for Jesus, how much more vital is it for you? Find someplace quiet today. Calm your thoughts. And remember to listen for God's still small voice. Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice. — 1 Kings 19:11-12 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #chaos #peace

Many believers are hostile to the truth that financial prosperity is included in what Jesus accomplished for us at the cross because manipulative preachers twisted it into a message of greed and selfishness. In truth, the whole point of everything we do as believers is to either bless others directly, or equip us to be a blessing to others. Our health and long life are just like our prosperity in this regard. God supplies both long life and prosperity so we can bless others by having a significant influence for the Kingdom of God. God blesses you for a purpose. Will you bless someone today? The generous soul will be made rich, and he who waters will be watered also himself. — Proverbs 11:25 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #generosity #prosperity

Jesus explained how we are to abide in him with an analogy of us being the branches and him being the vine. The branches must stay connected to the vine to retain life. One of the natural results of abiding in Jesus should be that we walk and live just as he walked and lived. The exact same power and Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead and powered all the miracles he performed is living inside you right now as a believer in Jesus. Renew your mind and let that power flow into every aspect of your life. That's how you will truly impact the hurting world around you. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. — 1 John 2:6 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #life #walk

There is not a single instance in scripture where Jesus refused to heal anyone. Yet there are seventeen times where the Bible says Jesus healed everyone present. This is in addition to more than forty other recorded instances of Jesus healing individuals in the Gospels. Jesus did a whole lot of healing. But he never put sickness on anyone. Don't believe the lie that your sickness is from God. Sickness is the enemy trying to steal your destiny and kill you. Hold onto the truth that God only brings healing and wholeness. Fight the enemy with that truth. But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all. — Matthew 12:15 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #healing #GodsWill

Have you ever known someone who was a very outspoken Christian constantly preaching at everyone around them, but were themselves such a mess that they caused strife and chaos everywhere they went? You almost want to say to them, "Please stop telling people you're a Christian. You're making it harder for the rest of us to reach them." Jesus said we are to be a city on a hill, a light shining before men. If the message our actions sends to our friends and family doesn't align with Jesus, preaching at them won't help bring them closer to Him. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. — Matthew 5:16 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #shine #influence

It is vital for you to come to a crystal clear understanding of exactly who God created you to be. The place to start is learning about the one who created you. As a follower of Jesus, Christ now lives in you. So learning about him helps you see your true best self now that you are born again. In truth, you are so much like Jesus that it's like you're his identical twin. Sure, you have your own personality and identity. But at the same time, you look as much like Jesus as two identical twins look like one another. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. — Galatians 2:20 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #character #identity

You are so thoroughly equipped to defeat that giant staring you in the face today that it's scary. When you were born again God installed a faith engine in the core of your being that has the potential to move mountains. On top of that, God himself moved in with you to power that faith engine for you. All you need to do is learn how to activate it. The answers you need are all waiting right there for you in the Bible. It is in the Word of God where you will find the activation sequence for the faith engine God installed in your heart.

The word of God is a strong tower that withstands the onslaught of problems the world sends our way. The key to being able to weather the storms of life is to be a doer of the Word, and not just a hearer only. Jesus contrasted two kinds of people. The ones who hear and do what Jesus instructs stand strong in spite of the storms. But those who hear yet neglect to do what Jesus says get swept away. Take action. Do what God tells you to do when he tells you to do it. Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock. — Matthew 7:24-25 (WEB ) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #storms #anchor

As a believer and follower of Jesus Christ your victory is assured. It has already been provided for you by God's grace and is therefore available for you to receive by faith. In fact, the only way you can be defeated is by quitting. You will receive what God promised you, but it will require faith and patience on your part. You must persevere. The enemy will whisper all sorts of lies in your ear about how or why it won't work for you. But God is no respecter of persons. Reject the enemy's lies. God will do what he promised. You will receive your harvest in due season if you do not give up!

God has called you into liberty with a purpose. He has a plan for your life that will bring you into your very own promised land. But God won't take you there without your agreement. The first critical thing you must do in order to step into the amazing life God is calling you towards is to say yes to that calling. God can only work with our yeses. There is nothing he can do with our maybes or our nos. Say yes to God today and walk the path worthy of that calling he longs to draw you towards!

The path to consistently experiencing a truly supernatural life is through intimacy with God himself. Jesus said he only said and did what he saw God, the Father doing. Jesus knew what the Father was saying and doing because he had a habit of spending time alone with the Father in prayer. Everything Jesus did flowed out of his intimacy with the Father. If it was vital for the life of Jesus, how much more critical is it for you and your life? In reality, time alone with God is one of the best gifts you can give yourself!

Worldly thinking drives emotional chaos because your emotions follow your thoughts. The Bible says that is being carnally minded. That thinking will kill you! Fortunately you can get off your emotional roller coaster by changing the way you think. You can become what the Bible calls spiritually minded and learn to think God thoughts instead. As this new thinking heals your emotions, you will experience both life and peace instead of chaos and death. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. — Romans 8:6 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #emotions #thoughts

If you feel distant from God, or like he is a stranger that you hardly know at this point, it is your attitude and perception that's causing the distance. God is still right there, patiently waiting and longing for more intimacy with you. If you think you must clean up your act to have intimacy with God, you have it backwards. The Bible says that's double-minded. That's a heart that wants to be near to God, but thinks it cannot because of wrong behavior. Instead, you are invited to draw near to God just as you are, and then he will clean up your act for you. Our behavior naturally changes in response to an intimate experience of God's love. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. — James 4:8 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #return

One thing about walking with Jesus is that the closer and more intimate we get with him, the clearer and brighter everything becomes in our lives. You may be going through a difficult season. Draw near to God. Spend time with him. Read and ponder his word. Learn his ways and follow his path. This is what abiding with Jesus looks like. And this is the path towards more perfect days.

When you believed in Jesus you were born into a whole new family.  Your father is now literally God himself. Jesus is your brother. Because you are born of God, that makes you an overcomer. That person who rolls over and gives up is not who you are anymore. You are a totally new creation. God remade you with a faith engine at the core of your being. When you begin to draw from that well of faith God put inside you, you will become the victorious overcomer you are meant to be. For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.

You are capable of far more than you realize. The very power and ability of God himself resides within you. Don't just scratch the surface of what God has for you. Going through life in survival mode is selfish, because when your best hope is just to survive, then you have nothing to give to anyone else. Get so intimate with God that you begin to thrive. As you do, you will start to bless others from the supernatural overflow that comes with drawing out the things God has put in you already. These signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.— Mark 16:17-18 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #supernatural

It seems obvious, but God never makes mistakes. He didn't mess up when he made you. God has no intention for you to be a failure. The truth is just the opposite. God's thoughts, plans, and intentions are for your total well being. The Hebrew word the Bible uses is "shalom". Look at all that word means: completeness, welfare, peace, completeness, safety, soundness, health, prosperity, quiet, tranquility, contentment, and friendship. God intends all this for you and much more! You were created to be a success! For I know the thoughts and plans that I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts and plans for welfare and peace and not for evil, to give you hope in your final outcome. — Jeremiah 29:11 (AMPC) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #failure #success

God did not create you to be alone and isolated. There is power when we connect with faithful friends as we move through life. God sized vision and assignments are always bigger than us and will require others to work with us to accomplish. The way to attract friends is to be friendly. And remember, Jesus is always with you no matter what. So regardless of how alone you feel right now, you have at least one true friend in Jesus. A man who has friends must himself be friendly, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. — Proverbs 18:24 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #friend #faithful

Most people have a very puny picture of who God is. Even as Christians, most times we see God far smaller than he is. This is why our problems so often overwhelm us. God is the one who made everything you can see simply by speaking it into existence. He determined where light comes from and where darkness goes. He laid out the precision movement of the stars and he plumbs the depths of the most chaotic heart. With God all things are possible. This God who is even bigger than you can imagine invites you to believe big, yes, even bigger than you've ever before imagined! Ah Lord God!

It is vital that you begin to see yourself the way God sees you. Most religion teaches that God thinks you are a horrible, filthy, worthless creature. Nothing could be further from the truth! God sees you as perfect and righteous in Christ, worth giving up his most prized possession for a chance to spend time with you. God's grace gives you the power to see the real you. But that clarity of vision will only come though seeing God's thoughts for you in his word. Meditate on scriptures that talk about you until they become real to your heart. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. — 1 Corinthians 15:10 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #grace #identity

God intentionally created us with feelings and emotions. However our feelings were never meant to control us. They do give us insight into what we believe when we pay attention. Emotional intensity reveals depth of our belief in that area. Feelings are a gauge, not a guide. They only indicate where you are, and shouldn't control where you are going. Always let God's word overrule your feelings. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and passions. — Romans 6:12 (AMP) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #word #feelings

Do you want to overcome that big problem in your life? Find a promise about your situation in God's word and stand on it. Though faith and patience you will inherit that promise. It takes perseverance, persistent endurance, to inherit the promises of God. The enemy will try to make you waver, to knock you down, and drain all hope so that you give up. But keep standing. Hold onto hope. Feed it with God's word. Watch your hope eventually grow into  powerful faith that changes your circumstances. The end of the book tells us Jesus has already won. Just keep standing with him. Therefore put on God’s complete armor, that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger], and, having done all [the crisis demands], to stand [firmly in your place]. — Ephesians 6:13 (AMPC) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #stand #overcome

Because it's God's Word, the Bible is like a mirror where we can see who we truly are. As you spend time in scripture, you learn what God says about you, and your new creation identity in Christ. As you learn these new things about yourself, you will find you start to behave in different ways because what you do flows out of who you think you are. You become a doer of the word. That's when you will begin to see God results from the God things you are doing. Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man viewing his natural face in a mirror. He views himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in his deeds. — James 1:22-25 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #word #mirror #identity

God's word is powerful. Nothing is impossible with God because of his word. As a result he can do anything, and no thought or purpose of God can be restrained or thwarted. God's word never fails us when mixed with our faith. Therefore you can trust his promises you find in the Bible. Believe them. Act on them. Then watch more of the Kingdom ways and Kingdom results move into your life as a result. For with God nothing is ever impossible and no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment. — Luke 1:37 (AMPC) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #word #neverfails

Many times our problems in life seem to overwhelm us. Yet because you are In Christ, God has made you the head and not the tail. You are only above and not beneath. Some translations say "always" above and not beneath. (It's in Deuteronomy 28:13 if you want to look it up and be encouraged.) Rise above your problems and take your rightful place. Hear the word of the Lord today and step out of the boat. It's time to walk above the adversity in your life! Then Peter called to him, “Lord, if it’s really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water.” “Yes, come,” Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. - Matthew 14:28-29 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #above #waterwalker

Do you know who you are? Not the person you've been told all your life by the world you are, but do you know who your creator, the one who made everything in the universe including yourself made you to be? At the end of the day, God's opinion is the one that matters more than all others combined. The Holy Spirit says you are one of God's very own children. You're family. God is your father and Jesus is your brother. Think about all that true identity means for you today. The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God; and if children, then heirs: heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. — Romans 8:16-17 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #family #heirs

All that's good in this world originates and radiates from God. He's the source of all truth, glory, love, peace, joy, mercy, faith, kindness, gentleness — basically everything and anything that's good comes from God. He's the ultimate positive charge. There is nothing negative about him. He's pure light. There's not a trace of darkness in him. Therefore, the closer you draw to God, the more of his light you yourself will radiate. This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. — 1 John 1:5 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #light #darkness

Do you know someone who seems to dominate every conversation they are in? They never really listen to what anyone else has to say because they do all the talking. How does that make you feel? Now imagine what God feels like when we do all the talking and never listen to what he has to say. That's something you can change today. Remember to listen to God when you pray. Allow your prayer time to be a true conversation where both sides can speak. Building a habit of listening to God will transform your life.

Many perceive the devil as a very powerful force in our world. But here's the thing. Authority trumps power. It doesn't matter how much power someone has access to, if they are not legally allowed to use that power, it's like they don't have it at all. Jesus gave you authority over all the power of the enemy. And that authority you have in Christ is backed up by all the power of Heaven itself. Remind the devil of his destiny. Use your authority in Jesus' name. Push back the darkness around you. Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy.

God sees things from a very different perspective than we do with our natural brains. Fortunately, as a follower of Jesus, you have the mind of Christ. That gives you a choice. You can continue to see things only with your natural brain. Or, you can choose to learn God's point of view and think God's thoughts. Growing in this area is how we experience God's best for our lives.

God has maxed out your account with everything you need to accomplish anything that he puts in front of you to do. If you need wisdom, knowledge, understanding, or creativity then it's already yours because you have the mind of Christ. Do you need the ability to get along with difficult people? It's already yours because you have the fruit of the spirit. When you need provision, God will supply all your needs from his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. The resources are yours. Receive them and realize your victory!

You can be in peace in the middle of whatever storm life throws at you. The key is to keep your focus on God, because he truly is bigger than any storm. Peter was able to walk on the waves in the midst of the storm as long as he focused on Jesus. But when his focus shifted onto the raging sea he began to sink. Make God the center of your attention. Keep your focus on Him. Then you will pass through any storm in perfect peace. You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. — Isaiah 26:3 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #Jesus #storm

The words we say are powerful when they line up with what we believe in our hearts. That's especially true when we believe the truth of God's own words. However, our words are ineffective when they don't line up with our beliefs. The Bible says that belief comes first, then we speak. Invest the time and energy into learning God's truth so thoroughly that it becomes a central part of you. Then, when you truly believe the truth deeply, watch your faith filled words powerfully impact your world.

The truth will indeed make you free, but only when you know it and believe it. Most of the ways of God are exactly backwards from the world's way of doing things. Because you were steeped in the world's system for so many years, give yourself time to soak in God's ways. You do this by meditating on the word of God. Pick a passage of scripture and ponder it as you go through your day. The more time you give yourself to think about the truth, the more quickly you will be transformed into the image of Christ.

Looking at the list of the fruit of the spirit in the Bible can be intimidating if we think we have to make ourselves behave in those ways. The good news is that all those characteristics are already inside you as a believer and follower of Jesus. You don't have to make yourself do those things because they are now part of who you are. When we release that fruit from inside us, we are living the life of Christ and releasing it to the hurting world around us. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control.

People rightly point to what Jesus did on our behalf at the cross and through his resurrection as the ultimate proof that God loves us. And because of the work Jesus accomplished, you are now adopted into the very family of God as a joint heir with Jesus himself. Your family lineage has changed. You have a new Father in heaven. This new position you have in Christ makes you living proof of a loving God! Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!

We live in an instant society where many are prone to stand in front of the microwave oven, tapping their foot wanting it to hurry up. We would do well to become more patient. Fortunately patience is part of the fruit of the spirit. It is already inside us because of our relationship with Jesus, just waiting to be released. Time in God's presence is the best way to grow in patience, which is key to inheriting the promises of God. Preparation time is never wasted time! We desire that every one of you show the same diligence for the full assurance of hope to the end, so that you may not be lazy, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. — Hebrews 6:11-12 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #patience

Giving is certainly not all about money. We can give to others in so many ways beyond cash. At the same time, Jesus our finances are the "least" thing that God trusts us with. Money is the starting place. It's not something folks want to talk about. But, according to Jesus,  until we become faithful in how we handle our finances, moving on to other things is really getting ahead of ourselves. The good news is this. As we learn to give and become more generous with our finances, it will naturally spill over into other areas of our life. Giving then becomes part of our lifestyle. That generosity will produce good fruit. He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.

It is a decision of our will to praise God and be thankful for all he does for us. We can choose to do this regardless of our circumstances. Praising and thanking God for who he is and what he's done is the core of worship. This enlarges our perspective of God and at the same time reduces our perception of the problems we face. It moves us into a place of faith, to where we begin to see real change in our world. You can start right now. Praise God. Thank him. Spend a little time in his presence and watch how your perspective shifts!

No matter what you are going through, regardless of whether you are in the midst of pain or in a season where everything seems to be going your way, it all is better in the presence of God. Jesus said he would never leave us or forsake us. God is always there. Yet it is our choice whether or not we enter into his presence. Unfortunately many don't look to God until their own personal pain gets too great to cope with. You don't have to wait. You can enter into God's very presence today and experience the fullness of joy that is in that place.

There is genuine power in our words. When the words we speak line up with what we genuinely believe in our hearts, we release power. When your heart is fully persuaded of the God's truth and you speak those words out, everything changes. You will get what you say when you believe it. The key is to steep your heart so thoroughly in God's Word that you know that you know that you know its truth, and no one can shake you off it. Then your own words will confidently line up with God's Word and begin to direct the circumstances around you. For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says. — Mark 11:23 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #words

You are special to God. The truth is God chose you because he desired a relationship with you. Even more than that, the Bible says God specifically appointed you to go and bear fruit. And not just any old fruit either. The fruit he appointed you to bear is good and lasting fruit of a specific kind. God chose you to bear the fruit of answered prayers. God is glorified when he answers our prayers. Therefore he deliberately chose you to display his glory as you become a fruit tree full of prayers he answers on your behalf. You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. — John 15:16 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #chosen #fruit

The Bible says something very profound about you that you may have missed. In Ephesians 1:6 the original Greek uses the word charitoō. Even though it derives from the root word charis, which we know means grace, it really does not have an English equivalent. The King James Version says God, "made us accepted." But it means so much more than that. In truth God has made us graceful, lovely, and agreeable. The Father pursues us with grace and infuses us with his grace and honors us with blessings. This is part of your new identity in Christ. Will you believe it today? to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved. — Ephesians 1:6 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #accepted #grace

It is unwise to allow our emotions and feelings determine what we believe. Instead we must look to the word of God to see truth, believe it, and then let our emotions adjust to that truth. The things of God are spiritual and therefore must be discerned by our spirits, and not by the emotions and feelings of our soulish man. Value the truth of God's word above your emotions. Then over time your emotions will learn to follow the truth. Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned. — 1 Corinthians 2:14 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #faith #feelings

The best way to grow your faith is to think about all the good things that are already in you because of what Jesus already did for you. The moment you were born again you became a brand new creature. All that old mess that made up your identity is no longer yours. Now you are identical to Jesus in the spirit. God made you into a spiritual identical twin to Jesus! That means your spirit is perfect already, right now. The more you think about the truth of your perfect spirit, the more your mind will become renewed to it, and the more your true spiritual perfection will spill out into the things you say and do as your faith grows. Think about that as you go through your day.

For God, love means doing more than feeling. The way Jesus explained it, we are to do for other people just what we would want someone to do for us if we were in their same situation. Our love for others should be visible to everyone around us. In fact, the way we love people should be so pronounced and obvious that it sets us a apart and identifies us as followers of Jesus. What act of kindness can you do today to show someone they are loved by God? And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? — James 2:15-16 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #help #needy

There is a real danger in accepting the identity that the world thrusts upon us. The world identifies you based on your past behavior. And that's how other people tend to think of you. Instead you should look to God and see your identity in the person he created you to be. You see, God was thinking about you before you were even born. Then he wrote down what he intended your life to be like in a book in heaven. Find out what God wrote in that book and start living the life God intended you to live! Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, When as yet there were none of them. How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand; When I awake, I am still with You. — Psalms 139:16-18 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #thoughts #identity

We are light for the world. That light radiating from us should be as hard to miss as the lights of a city built on the highest point for miles around. Not only that, but the glow of a large city at night can be seen long before any of it comes directly into view. Likewise the glow of our influence for the Kingdom of God should be detected by people long before they realize the details of the source of that influence. How will you let your light shine today? You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. — Matthew 5:14 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #light #shine

God poured his very own love into our hearts when we believed in Jesus and were born again. You have the capacity to love others just like God himself does. The challenge is in learning to exercise that ability to love others. The world spent many years training us to love ourselves instead of others. It takes intimate time in the presence of God and meditation on his word to retrain ourselves to release the love that he has put in us toward others. Are you willing to get into God's presence and advance your learning process? Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. — Romans 5:5 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #love

Far too often we feel the need to point out what others are doing wrong or what we see they should be doing instead. Often that compulsion is motivated from a sincere desire for what we see as their best interest. But here's the thing. It's not your job to fix other people. It's exhausting and drives people away from you. Besides, Jesus never assigned you the task of fixing others. Instead he instructed us to love one another. Since love is not controlling, love is not about making people behave the way we want them to. Instead of trying to change others, relax. Take the issue to God and see what he has to say about it. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another. — John 13:34 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #control #love

God's heart desire is to be a blessing and reward you. When you diligently seek God you are exercising your faith by definition (Hebrews 11:6). God doesn't just reward that kind of faith, he himself promises to be your reward. That means you get something even better than all the things God can do for you. Yes, all that stuff is now available to you. But the "even better" part is that you now get to have a relationship with the one who created the universe and sustains it. You can come to know intimately the one who breathed life into your very soul. Think about that as you go through your day today! After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.” — Genesis 15:1 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #God #reward #himself

Love is an action, not a feeling. Our love for others should be visible in our actions. In truth, unless we do something tangible to make someone's life better in some way, we aren't really loving them.  Our actions speak louder than our words. Think of a way you can bless someone today by doing something nice for them that it totally unexpected and undeserved. When you follow through and do it, you will be expressing the love of God towards that person. Love is patient and is kind. Love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails. — 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #God #love #action

The Bible says the devil seeks those he "may" devour. That means it's not automatic. Our ungodly sinful behavior gives the devil access to mess with us in our lives. This is why godly behavior is important. The sinful stuff we do is not going to make God angry with us. But it does give the devil access to devour us. Refuse to be devoured. Take yourself off the devil's menu! Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. — 1 Peter 5:8 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #sober #devil #devour #OffTheMenu

When you believed on Jesus you became a special class of person that the Bible calls someone who overcomes the world. You get this status because Jesus utterly defeated the devil. Jesus defeated him so thoroughly and so publicly that every angel and demon saw that defeat. Your status in Christ gives you that same victory over the enemy and over the world. You are an overcomer! Walk in the victory Jesus won for you. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? — 1 John 5:5 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #overcome #victory

Love and Law are two very different starting points. Law is clearly defined so it seems easier at first, which is why this approach is so attractive to so many. The problem is law can become mechanical, completely devoid of relationship. For many it is exactly that. But love is relational by definition. That makes love less precise and more difficult to quantify, which intimidates many. But love is liberating in ways the law could never be. Plus, the uncertainty of love fades away as we come to understand how much the Father truly loves us. It all starts with seeing God's goodness, which demonstrates his love for us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. — Romans 8:38-39 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #love #law

The best way to grow your faith is to start with believing for small things in your every day life. Find individual promises in God's word which address each of those small obstacles. Then believe God to keep his promises. You will gain confidence in God's promises as you start to see those small victories. Then, when a big crisis comes your way your faith will be in a much stronger place to command that mountain to move out of your path. And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive. — Matthew 21:22 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #prayer #faith

True biblical hope is more powerful than most believers realize. Before we get into a place of faith, we have hope. There are times when life’s storms rage around us. Like a mariner in a stormy sea at night catching a first glimpse of a lighthouse for a bearing, we can hold onto hope and plot a true course based on God’s word. We can expect a good end even when it looks like all is lost because we know from the Bible that God is for us. Hold onto hope and watch it grow into faith! For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees? But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience. — Romans 8:24-25 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #hope

When you were born again you became an identical twin to Jesus. You share the same father, and the same spirit with him. You were born of the exact same seed. That means you have the capacity to think and do the things Jesus thought and did. The big challenge is that your mind has been corrupted by the thinking of this world. Fortunately you can change the way you think to line up with God's ways of thinking. The more time you spend in God's word and amongst God's people, the more your thinking will conform to your true identity in Jesus. Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world. — 1 John 4:17 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #identity #perfect

Most Christians have no problem believing God can love the most vile of sinners and bring them to salvation. Even so, a great many Christians believe that God is displeased with themselves because of the junk they still do. But here's the thing. Yes, God knows about that sin you still hold in your heart, even though you are really good at hiding it from everyone else. Yet God still loves you just as much as if you did everything perfectly. Instead of trying to love God, invest time thinking about how much he loves you. As the revelation of God's love for you grows, the junk and sin you're still holding onto will fade away and you'll leave it behind. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins. — 1 John 4:10 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #God #love

Regret and worry are two weapons of the enemy that keep us from stepping into our destinies. The past is behind us. God's mercies are new every morning to free us from the chains of our past mistakes. Worrying is nothing more than meditating about bad things that might happen, but mostly won't. Instead, stay in today. Seek God. Prioritize His Kingdom presence throughout your day and you will see your worries and regrets fade into insignificance. You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You. — Isaiah 26:3 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #worry #regret #peace

Finishing well is critical in the Kingdom of God. How we finish is far more important than how we were when we started. We can even overcome any drift off course we may have in the middle of our lives by turning towards God as our days draw to a close. The devil wants you to believe you will always be the sum total of all your yesterdays and their mistakes. But in truth, God is calling you towards your true identity, which is yet in the future. Don't let your past hold you back. Set a course for your true future self and decide today that you will finish well! Brothers, I don’t regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do: forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #past #change #finishstrong

Significance, purpose, and enduring inner peace is available to everyone through Jesus Christ. But the truly good news is that all the hard work has already been done for you. All that's required on your part is to receive what Jesus did for you, and believe it by faith. That's the good news. The bad news is that most people still want to earn what they get. There's just something about receiving a free gift that they didn't earn which most folks can't accept. So they continue to try and earn what has already been offered to them as paid for. Are you willing to let go of your striving and enter into the rest Jesus has for you today?

Our natural instinct is to focus on ourselves. Doing so magnifies our own problems. Loving others and focusing on them goes completely against our natural thinking, especially when we are in the midst of our own life struggles. However, loving others is very liberating and has the pleasant side effect of diminishing our own challenges. Look for ways to bless others and demonstrate the love of God to them. You will be pleasantly surprised how much better it makes you feel as you build this habit into your life! Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God.

His resurrection is the one thing that separates those who follow Jesus from all the religions of the world. The resurrection of Jesus is fact of history that many choose to disbelieve. Yet to those who do believe and receive Jesus, he gives the right to become children of God. Praise God Jesus is alive today! We now receive that same life now by faith and release it to others in the power and name of Jesus. He said to them, “Do not be frightened. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.

One trap some believers fall into is relying on yesterday's faith. They hold onto an encounter with God for years without ever seeking to deepen their relationship with God. That's not what God intends for your life. Each day is a new opportunity for a fresh encounter with the one who knows you best of all, and at the same time, loves you more than anyone else possibly could. Lean into that relationship new every morning. Face each day with fresh faith. And without faith it is impossible to please God, for he who comes to God must believe that He exists and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. — Hebrews 11:6 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #faith #fresh

Even though Jesus kept the law perfectly, the Bible says he became sin on our behalf. He took the punishment we deserved. Therefore a great exchange takes place by faith. Jesus gets all our sin and we get all of his righteousness. That means you have perfectly right standing with God, no matter what you've done, no matter what happens today, or even what you do in the future. Accept that truth. Think about it. Let it explode into reality in your heart.

Your heart is the ground that determines your future. It is in your heart where you decide how intimately you want to come to know Jesus.

You don't need more information as much as you need more revelation. It starts with God's word. Take scripture into your soul. But it doesn't stop there. We can get insight and wisdom about that word from our born again spirits. That's when that word comes alive for us personally. And that's when it truly transforms our lives in that area.

It's not good when we make rules for ourselves when we want to change our behavior. Even though these rules we put in place make sense to the natural mind, the Bible says in truth they are worthless when it comes to keeping our flesh in line. This is because the law gives sin it's power over us. Those rules we put in place for ourselves seem like a good idea. But in reality, they make things worse for us. Instead of looking to a rule, look to Jesus. He's the one who produces lasting change in our hearts. That's the best way to change our behavior. These things have indeed a show of wisdom in self-imposed worship and humility and neglecting of the body, but are worthless against the indulgence of the flesh. — Colossians 2:23 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #rules #law #worthless

We make things too complicated. Really, the Christian life is all about intimacy of God. It's about knowing God and making him known to others, plain and simple. John 3:16 is the most quoted verse in the Bible. There it clearly says the reason God loved us so much is so we could have "eternal life." Jesus later told us that eternal life is knowing God. This is why Peter's denial that he knew Jesus was so serious. He was denying the very purpose Jesus came to earth. Are you willing to invest the time and effort to get to know God intimately? And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. — John 17:3 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #intimacy #relationship #knowing

You won't grow to spiritual maturity by accident. Just like adults can act very childish, your maturity is not measured by how long you have been a believer. The way you grow spiritually is by investing time in the Word of God. Read it. Study it. Ponder it. Listen to good Biblical teaching. Until you make a space in your life to learn who God is through his word, you won't be able to receive all he has for you. And you will keep struggling with the same old problems. But when you do, you give God room to move an operate in your life. That's the way we walk into maturity in Christ. As newborn babies, desire the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow, if it is true that you have experienced that the Lord is good. — 1 Peter 2:2-3 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #relationship #time #room

The very wisdom of God is available to you personally. As a follower of Jesus, you now have access to that wisdom. The Bible says that Jesus Christ himself is the personification of God's wisdom (1 Cor. 1:30). And since you now have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16) you have access to his wisdom. The key to growing in that wisdom is to invest time studying the Bible and learn what it has to say about both God and about you. that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him — Ephesians 1:17 (WEB). via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #spirit #wisdom

God loves you so much that he gave up the most precious possession he had just on the hope that you would be willing to have a relationship with him. By sending his son Jesus to pay the ultimate price with his very life, God showed vividly how much you are worth to him. See yourself how God sees you. You are priceless in the eyes of God! For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from the fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish. — 1 Peter 1:18-19 (HCSB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #worthless #priceless

It is possible to change ourselves at some level simply by making a decision to do so. Not only is that often difficult, but  those types of changes rarely last very long. However, when God changes us there is little, if any, effort on our part. And those changes last a lifetime. The key to being changed by God is getting to know him. That means spending time in the Bible and letting his words impact our soul until they change our hearts. Change and growth are natural byproducts of intimate time in the presence of God. Establish my footsteps in your word. Don’t let any iniquity have dominion over me. — Psalms 119:133 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #change

You were created with a purpose. Not only does God have a plan for your life, but it's good. God's plan for your life is peace, prosperity, favor, health and rest. However, God won't force his plan onto your life. He gives you the freedom to discover his purpose for your life and then a choice whether or not you want to line up with that purpose. It takes effort to renew your mind to the things of God. But learning his will for your life to become filled with purpose and destiny is well worth the time it takes! Why not start today? Therefore don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. — Ephesians 5:17 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #purpose #significance

Contentment is not about putting up with less. True contentment comes from abiding in Jesus. When we get in Christ so thoroughly that we see our identity just as God sees us the cares of this world fade away as contentment overtakes us. At the same time, abiding in Christ produces increased fruitfulness and growth in our lives as we see more and more of our prayers answered by the Father. And it all starts by sincerely seeking the Kingdom of God because that's where this contentment is found. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. — Matthew 6:33 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #contentment #growth

We receive from God by grace through faith. We can't receive by grace alone. Many people reject God's grace by rejecting the fullness of what he provided through Jesus - whether it's salvation, deliverance, healing, or prosperity. Likewise we can't receive by faith alone. No matter how hard we believe we can't appropriate what God hasn't provided for us by grace. The Bible reveals what God has already provided to for us so we can then appropriate it by faith. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God — Ephesians 2:8 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #grace #provision #wisdom

Here's some good news: the faithfulness of God is not dependent on you. Even when you mess up, God is still faithful. He can't help it because faithfulness is part of his nature. It's who God is! That means you can depend on the promises of God, even when you make mistakes and don't measure up to any standard of sinless perfection. Take the pressure off. Give yourself permission to fail. Know that God is still faithful and true no matter what you do. Focus on his goodness and watch how things improve for you as you do. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself. — 2 Timothy 2:13 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #faithful #failure

Life brings problems. We aren't exempt from that reality, even as followers of Jesus. However, we are called to be overcomers. The way we overcome the problems the world throws at us is to shift our focus. It's not that we deny the problem. Instead it's a matter of lifting up and magnifying the Father, Jesus, and the things of the Kingdom of God. When we view our situation with that eternal perspective, our problems shrink away to insignificance. For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we don’t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. — 2 Corinthians 4:17-18 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #problems #eternal

The one thing that should set Christians apart from everyone else is the ability to get results. Unfortunately most followers of Jesus don't believe they have enough faith to see the results they seek. These unbelieving believers don't realize that the faith they need is already inside them. It's part of the fruit of the spirit just waiting to be released. God already gave you the tools you need be victorious in life. Start believing. Today, right now, start releasing that faith God put in you! But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. — Galatians 5:22-23 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #faith #results

God is waiting for you to ask the tough questions that burn in your soul so he can give you the answers you long for. The answer may not be what we want to hear in the moment. But what God says to us will be exactly the thing our soul needs to empower us to move forward. Do you have enough humility to sincerely look to God for your answers today? The true test is whether you are willing to do what he says. Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things which you do not know. — Jeremiah 33:3 (MEV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #prayer #answers

The key to living a victorious life is staying in Christ. Jesus said we are to "abide" in him. That word abide means to remain in, tarry, to continue to be present, to be held and kept continually, to not depart. As followers of Jesus, our relationship with him should be so intimate that, over time, we become just like him. In fact, this idea of abiding was so important to Jesus that he said apart from him we can do nothing. On the flip side, when we do abide in him by faith, we can overcome anything victoriously, no matter what the world throws at us! For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith. — 1 John 5:4 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #victory #overcome

The word of God is the single biggest source of power on this planet. Yet in his infinite wisdom, God chooses to release that power through people. When we respond in faith to the word God has already given us, that's when the potential is released. It's not just going to fall on our heads. We've got to reach out and take it. Our faith response sets of a chain reaction that releases that power brings glory to God. Will you respond today, release your faith, and glorify Him? Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. — Ephesians 3:20-21 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #word #power #potential

Fear and faith are opposites. Fear comes from thinking about negative outcomes and all the bad things that might happen. But faith comes from investing time meditating on the Word of God. When we ponder those truths we build our faith. Acting on the promises and principles of the Kingdom of God is expressing our faith. As we grow in confidence in the things of God, our faith is strengthened. In the end it's a choice. You can think about the worldly things meant to destroy you. Or will you instead think about how much God loves you and the eternal, abundant, overflowing life he made available for you? There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love. — 1 John 4:18 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #fear #faith #love

God has given us so much in Jesus. As a believer you have access to the very mind of Christ. That means you have access to the knowledge and wisdom of God. Plus you are already filled with the fruit of the spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience, and everything else is already in you waiting to be let out. All of that is more than enough to enable to you to successfully navigate through whatever trial you are facing today. Focus on God!

We all make mistakes, mess up, fall short, and fail sometimes. The world wants you to take on those failures and make them your identity. Don't buy into that lie. Your identity is not determined by what you do. As a believer, your identity is no longer "failure". It's now "in Christ". And that means you are now a victor and an overcomer. You are the very righteousness of Jesus. Will you choose to walk in your true identity today? If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. — Colossians 3:1-3 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #failure #identity

In much the same way our natural fathers want what is best for their sons and daughters, your heavenly Father is for you. God always wants the best for you. The difference is, where our earthly fathers fail and make mistakes, God is always perfectly for you. Since the creator of the universe with his infinite unlimited resources is for you, than whatever comes against you truly is insignificant by comparison. When we shift our focus off the problem that is against us right now and instead focus on the full glory of God, our problems will indeed fade into the background.

When you believed in Jesus you were born again, adopted into God's own family. That makes you a direct child of the Father God himself. Since you are his daughter, his son, you also are entitled to inherit the Kingdom of God right along with Jesus! This is your new identity in Christ. Learn who you really are. Then start walking in this, your true identity! And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. — Galatians 4:6-7 (WEB) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #identity #sonship #inheritance

Ultimately how we start something is no where near as important as how we finish the thing. A bad start will be forgotten if we finish well and win. At the same time, a great start will be meaningless if we quit or disqualify ourselves from finishing. No matter how you've treated your walk with God up to now, make a decision to move forward from this moment and finish well. Winning is worth the prize!

Here's some good news. You don't need to force yourself to be generous. The fruit of the spirit is already inside you because you're a believer. You don't have to force it to appear any more than an apple tree needs to struggle to produce apples. When you waken to the awareness that it's already inside you, you can simply get your flesh out of the way and let that fruit out. Then generosity will naturally flow from your spirit.

The love of God is the most powerful force in the universe. God's love can take a weak woman and confront the mighty. It can use a foolish boy to confound the wise. And it can transform the most wretched individual into a prince among men. God's love will transform you too, if you receive it and allow it to mold your heart in the ways of His Kingdom.

Your ability as a believer to be joyful in the face of adversity sets you apart. It is a supernatural sign to the unbelieving world that you are different because of your relationship with Jesus. When we allow the fruit of the spirit of joy to be displayed in our lives , regardless of our circumstances, it shows the world an overcoming hope that they will naturally ask about. Then we become magnetic as people start asking us why we're different.

When God gives us a word, he is serious that we should obey it. Disregarding a clear word from God, even for what seems like the best of reasons, might have disastrous consequences that are completely hidden right now in the time of our decisions. But when we learn to hear God's voice correctly and clearly, and then do what he tells us to the absolute best of our ability, then we will step into a destiny we barely dared to dream was possible. But Samuel replied, “What is more pleasing to the Lord: your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission is better than offering the fat of rams. Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft, and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols. So because you have rejected the command of the Lord, he has rejected you as king.” — 1 Samuel 15:22-23 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #identity #destiny

Not knowing our true identity in Christ is perhaps the single biggest factor that robs us from stepping into our God intended destinies. One of the most effective lies of the enemy is getting you to believe you are something other than who you are. Your true identity is in Christ. Look to Jesus. He will reveal to you who God made you to be because he is the author and finisher of your faith. Once you know that, you will be able to step into that destiny God plans for you to have. Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. — 1 John 3:2 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #Jesus #identity #destiny

Sickness is always portrayed as a curse in the Old Testament. It is never called a blessing. Today we have a much better covenant with even better promises. Jesus has broken every curse from us. The Bible never records an instance of Jesus putting sickness on anyone. But there are several times where it says he healed everyone present. This is because there is no sickness in Christ. Unfortunately we don't really believe that truth. As a result of our ignorance and unbelief we still struggle with sickness. Fortunately we can renew our minds to the truth in this area to the point where our hearts begin to believe it. Then we can receive directly from Jesus the healing he makes available to us. When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them. — Luke 4:40 (NKJV) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #sickness #healing

What we focus on matters. The love Jesus has for us is far more impactful than the love we have for him. Far to many Christians make their worship time all about telling Jesus how much they love him and scarcely acknowledge how much he loves us. Peter was so sure of his love for Jesus that he said he would die with him. Yet within hours he denied even knowing Jesus. John was "the disciple whom Jesus loved." As a result, John was the only one of the 12 at the cross when Jesus died, and the only one who did not die a martyr's death. Ask God to show you how much he loves you today! May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God. — Ephesians 3:19 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #love

God is the God of second chances. He is masterful at taking someone from the lowest position and using them to influence powerful people. God has chosen the foolish and weak things in this world to confound and put to shame the wise and the mighty. As we get a deeper revelation of who we are we become transformed from glory to glory. When we truly see God's glory is when our lives transform supernaturally from within by the Spirit of The Lord. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.

Part of renewing our minds as believers is learning to think more positively and find the good around us. Don't let the world fill you with fear and get you discouraged by obsessing about everything that's wrong around you. Instead focus your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Make it a point to think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. You will find that there is much more that's good in your life than you realize, if you only choose to look for it.

Unity is incredibly powerful. When people are in unity there is truly no limit to what they can accomplish. This is because unity is one of only four things where God commands a blessing. There are blessings throughout the Bible. But four times God steps that up and the Bible says he "commands" a blessing. Unity is one of those. The enemy knows this and does everything he can to keep the body of Christ as divided as possible. Jesus said his disciples would be known by their love for one another. Yet Christians are some of the most divided people who refuse to work together on much of anything. This should not be. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, Running down on the beard, The beard of Aaron, Running down on the edge of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon, Descending upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing— Life forevermore.

Truth trumps facts. This is the core reality that makes procedural crime dramas so popular today. Facts can vary by perspective. But truth simply is. The true version of what actually happened is true regardless of how it was perceived by the people who were present. It’s the misdirection of perception that enables magicians to do their tricks. Invariably the facts we perceive are not what magicians are really doing. But the facts we see, our faulty perceptions, don’t change what is true. Truth trumps facts. While we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

Any promise of God that we can find in the Bible has already been given to us through Jesus. But even though every promise is already ours doesn't mean it will automatically come to pass. We have a part to play in the process too. God's grace provides the promises. We still need to apply our faith to those promises before we can see the harvest manifest in our lives. Through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. (Romans 5:2) For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. (2 Corinthians 1:20) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #promises #faith #harvest

There is a book of our destiny written for us in Heaven before time began. Our mission on this earth is to learn what’s in our book and accomplish it. That way we help bring the Kingdom of God into our world like Jesus taught us to pray. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed.

We are in the midst of an epic battle of the ages between the forces of good and evil. It's time for followers of Jesus to put away passivity and reclaim territory from the enemy to expand the Kingdom of God. We have already been provided with the exact armor we need to win every battle headed our way. Will you put on that armor and take your stand? Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. (Ephesians 6:13) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #armor #stand

God hears all our payers and is ready to help us when we need it. The same Jesus who is seated at the right hand of the Father experienced life as a human being here on Earth.

When you were born again, your spirit was completely made new. Your old nature was completely changed. Now your spirit is identical to Jesus' spirit. This new you in the spirit is who you really are. It's your new true identity. Learn who you now are in the spirit, and then watch your behavior become more and more like Jesus. In this way God’s love is perfected in us, so that we may have boldness on the Day of Judgment, because as He is, so are we in this world.

As a born again believer in Jesus Christ, you have the Holy Spirit of God living on the inside of you. Because he's already inside you, that means you have a direct line access directly to God himself.

Isaac shows us that one man, blessed and anointed by God can plant during a drought and reap a hundredfold harvest. Then he will become more powerful than even the kings around him. This kind of victory and success only flows out of an intimate relationship with God through Jesus. Then God can show us where and when to plant so that we will receive the harvest best suited to advance the Kingdom of God.

People watch what we do. When our actions line up with our words, and both line up with what the Bible says, that's when we draw people towards Jesus. It doesn't matter how dark it is around us, we can still bring the light of God's goodness everywhere we go. Doing so glorifies God, because we are reflecting his character. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:16) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #Jesus #light #shine

You were made for greatness! At least that's the way God sees you. Do you see yourself like God sees you?

We don't become sons and daughters of God because of anything we do. That change in status of adoption into God's family happens by faith as we accept what Jesus did on our behalf. Our inheritance is not earned. It is granted to us because we are indeed children of God. We receive that inheritance by faith, not by works. For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Romans 8:15-16) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #God #children #inheritance

Jesus said discipleship is the path to freedom. It's only the truth you know, when you are abiding continually in Jesus' word that will set you free. We find that liberty in the grace message that Jesus brought to earth. In Christ we no longer need to earn God's approval. Nor will we be punished for our shortcomings. That grace brings freedom indeed! Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.

The world gets things backwards and determines a person's identity by what they do. It's different in the Kingdom of God. There identity is determined by how we relate to Jesus. Then everything we do flows out of that identity. When you look at all the ministry stuff you do as your source of value and identity, then you view yourself with a worldly perspective. Instead, find out who you are in Christ. Then everything you do will become ministry. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.

God has already given us everything we need to accomplish the things he's assigned us to do. We just need to receive what he's already supplied. That means we need to renew our minds with the truth of God's Word and continue in intimate relationship with him. Jesus calls this ongoing intimate relationship "abiding". Just abide in Jesus and you will have everything you need to be a world overcomer!

One of the last things Jesus did before leaving this earth was to deputize believers with his authority. We have been commissioned to push back the world of darkness by teaching people what it means to be a disciple of Jesus and how to live in accordance to the ways of the Kingdom of God. And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

Because God's kind of love is kind, forgiving, and never controlling, it gives people the freedom to make mistakes and fail. This love, full of mercy and grace, is a stark contrast to the world where every failure is punished ruthlessly. Sadly, far too much of the Christian Church behaves like the world in this area. We would all do better to instead reflect God's character more and give people around us the freedom to fail. Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Our generosity in giving to others is a reflection of God's righteous character living through us. Not only did God give us his only son, but he also gives us his very name by adopting us into his family through Christ. When we are in turn generous to others it exposes God's generous nature to those around us. Now He who supplies seed to the sower and supplies bread for your food will also multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness.

Sin traps people as slaves in bondage to the world around them. Slaves are controlled by their masters and do whatever those controlling the slaves force them to do. As believers and followers of Jesus we have been adopted into the family of God and now are God's own sons and daughters. That makes us truly free from our former slavery to sin and the world around us.

The beauty of truth is that it can be believed before it is seen. In fact, it must be believed in order for it to be seen. If we believe lies or disbelieve the truth we won't see the truth manifest in our lives as fully as God intends for us. Our emotions are fickle and easily swayed by the world around us.

Far too often we put off dealing with problems in our lives and allow them to fester. We waste precious time and emotional energy  being irritated or frustrated by things. We choose to worry about stuff instead of address it. Yet often when we finally make it a point to confront the issue, we find it is resolved far more easily than we expected. All those fears we built up in our minds typically fall away when we finally stop worrying and step into positive action. You cannot conquer what you refuse to confront.

As followers of Jesus we are are invited into a relationship with the one true God and creator of this universe. We have an opportunity to get to know him at a very personal level. Unfortunately so many of us settle for knowing just a little bit about God when He offers to let us get to know him very deeply indeed. He's cleared his calendar and makes himself available to us. The question is, how much time with him will we make in our own schedules? And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

Religion tells us to fight and that we must defend the faith. But Jesus tells us something completely different. Since Jesus already won the victory, he tells us to enter into his rest. God gives us the victory in Christ, so we no longer have to fight to obtain it. We simply receive the victory he's already won. It's time to wake up to the truth that war is over and stop fighting to win what's already won. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Jesus intends for his own joy to fill each of us until it overflows. Unfortunately many Christians don't ever spend enough intimate time with Jesus to ever really experience that joy in a meaningful way. According to Jesus, we should be so full of his joy that it spills out on those around us. People should be thrilled to see us coming because they know they will be lifted up by our infectious joy. That is one of the results of spending time with Jesus.

Today the world elevates offense as the greatest sin you can do towards me. But the Bible says we are to love instead of taking offense. This love of which I speak is slow to lose patience—it looks for a way of being constructive. It is not possessive: it is neither anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own importance. Love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage. It is not touchy. It does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good men when truth prevails. Love knows no limit to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing that still stands when all else has fallen. And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also. (1 John 4:21) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #love #offense

Sowing and reaping is a universal law which applies both to the natural world and to the supernatural Kingdom of God. The life you have today is the harvest of seed sown years ago. The good news is that you have the ability to sow different seed today that will produce a vastly different life for yourself in the future. Whatever seed you plant today is what determines your destiny tomorrow. What seed will you choose to sow into your life today?

Many blame God for sending the death, loss, and destruction they see happening in the world. However, God is not the one sending that mess into people's lives today. Instead, he's the one who is the source of deliverance from all that mess. Jesus said he came that we might have abundant life, full until it overflows. He said that it's the thief who comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. Instead of blaming God, learn his true character. He's longing to help you today in whatever situation you find yourself in.

Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to guide and empower us. In the Bible we see the most common attribute associated with the Spirit of God is power. This power of the Holy Spirit is closely connected to the Word of God. It validates God's Word to help people see it is. And it is Holy Spirit power which illuminates God's Word by providing believers with the wisdom to understand it at a heart level. This heart-level revelation knowledge goes far deeper than mere head knowledge, which is why the wisdom of God is so incredibly life transforming!

What you focus on will dictate how you feel. God will keep us in perfect peace if we are willing to trust him. The key is to make God the center of our attention regardless whatever storm in life might be raging all around us. There is something good in every situation, if you are willing to see it. Training yourself to see it and focus on that good will dramatically transform your life. You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you!

Hope and optimism should be part of what we are known for as citizens of the Kingdom of God and followers of Jesus. The hope we have in Jesus is steadfast and sure. It anchors our soul in the very presence of God. We may be going through tough times. Everyone does. But as believers, we know the tough times are temporary. Things will get better for us. Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

God takes pleasure in seeing his Kingdom expand. That's why the Bible says that he makes sure those who are generous are supplied with the means to give. As you become more generous, God will bring more resources your way to allow you to exercise that generosity more fully. Before long it becomes a virtuous cycle of giving and receiving! Not only are you blessed in the process, but those who experience your generosity are blessed, and so is God because the Bible says that he also takes pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness (2 Corinthians 9:10) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #sowers #giving #God

Our testimony is powerful for overcoming the enemy. That enemy only reminds us of every mistake we've ever made, and every time we have fallen short. He accuses us day and night. Yet no person who still has breath is too far gone that God can't or won't pick them up, set them free, give them a peace that passes understanding along with a fullness of joy that replaces any sorrow. God can turn any mess into a message, any test into a testimony, and any victim into a victor! And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.

God's grace has put tremendous potential to realize the hopes and dreams in your heart, even the ones you've locked away as impractical or impossible. A good way to think about grace is that it's God's perfect provision for your every need. God loves you so much that he wants you to experience supernatural peace while you prosper in every way possible. "For I know what I have planned for you," says the Lord. "I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope." (Jeremiah 29:11) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #grace #potential

When we praise God regardless of our present circumstances it changes the very atmosphere around us. It can even change our circumstances. For example, Paul and Silas were unjustly beaten and chained in prison. Yet they praised God through the night anyway. At midnight there was a great earthquake. Their chains fell off and the prison doors opened! How will you change the atmosphere around you with praise today? Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name.

Many people misapply the law of sowing and reaping to finances in a way that fuels selfishness. But that's not the way it works. We cannot bribe God with money to our own selfish ends. Instead, we see blessings in the spirit and release our faith to pull it from the spiritual into the natural. And the primary reason for blessings is to advance the Kingdom of God so we can bless others. There is nothing selfish to the process at all when it is operating correctly. Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God.

Jesus is the solid rock foundation on which our lives our built. When we hear the truth of Jesus and line up our lives with what he says, that's when we have a solid foundation under us. Hearing alone is not enough. We must also do what he says. The best place to go when we are feeling overwhelmed is to Jesus. He is our rock, our fortress, and deliverer. “Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. “But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell.

God made us as three part beings - spirit, soul, and body. When we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior our spirit is transformed in an instant and receive an entirely new identity. Transforming our soul and our body takes longer. The Bible calls the unrenewed portions of our soul and our body as our "flesh". (Unfortunately some translations use the less-clear term "sinful nature.") When we put our spirit in charge and let it rule over our flesh, the Bible calls that "walking in the spirit." And when we do that, we see amazing supernatural God-things happen in our lives! For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.

Jesus said  that he came so we may have life and have it so abundantly it overflows. That life full of peace, joy, hope, and so much more is now available to us through Christ. But it doesn't just fall in our lap. Ignorance can keep us from the fullness of what is now available to us as believers. We need to learn everything God's grace has supplied for us in Christ and then receive it by faith. That's when we truly experience that fully overflowing life Jesus came to provide for us! But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!

When we understand our position in Christ our prayers are powerful and effective. Paul told us to put on the armor of God so we can resist the enemy. The only offensive weapon we have is the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Paul also tells us the way to wield that weapon: by praying in the Spirit. It is when we come boldly to the Father in prayer that we find his grace to help in our time of need. Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere. (Ephesians 6:18) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #prayer #power

In the Bible, Paul refers to seeing things with spiritual eyes as either being led by the Spirit, or walking in the Spirit. He said that being led by God's Spirit is one of the defining traits of those who have been adopted into God's family as his own sons and daughters. Then John tells us that it is as sons and daughters of God that we overcome the world. Therefore, seeing the world around us through spiritual eyes is one of the surest ways to see consistent victory in our lives. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. (Romans 8:14) For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. (1 John 5:4) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #victory #faith

The only way to truly connect with God is to feed your faith, not chase after a feeling. Our feelings are in our soul and part of our natural man. It is not there, but rather in our spirits where we truly connect with God's presence. Renew your mind to the things of the spirit by learning the truths contained in God's word and stop chasing your feelings. Then you will finally step off the emotional roller coaster and finally get on the road to spiritual maturity. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

It is a very dangerous thing to criticize and condemn other believers. Jesus said he would build his church and he takes it very seriously when people mess with it. He calls the church his bride, and he's coming back for her. So you better have a very clear word from God before you criticize or condemn others in that church. Otherwise you will have to answer to Jesus. "I didn't really mean it" won't be an acceptable excuse. But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. (Matthew 12:36) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #church #bride #Christ

Yes God can do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine, but only according to the power that is WITHIN us. That power is faith. What God has supplied through his grace is not just going to fall on our heads. We must reach out and take it by faith. The faith is in believing how much God loves us personally individually and that he wants to move through us. God's grace has already supplied what we need. Yet we will only see the benefit of that supply when we receive it by faith. Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us (Ephesians 3:20) #Charis #Bible #grace #faith #superabundance

Jesus never once put sickness on anyone. But there are dozens of times the Bible records that Jesus healed everyone who came to him. At least 6 times Jesus told the person he had just healed, "your faith has made you well." The love and compassion of Jesus has provided healing for us. Faith receives that provision into our bodies and we are made well. And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. (Acts 10:38) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #love #healing

Jesus' salvation covers both forgiveness AND healing. This is the grace of God providing a way to make us well. The provision for your need of healing is there waiting for you to receive it by faith.

Faith requires action. If it doesn’t move us to do something or say something – actually take some kind of action – it’s not really faith at all. Until we make it tangible with action our “faith” is just a bunch of words. James says that unless faith produces action is in fact dead, or not faith at all. So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless. — James 2:17 (NLT) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #faith #action

God's plans for you are far better and far bigger than any of your own plans for yourself. It’s up to you to discover them and cooperate with them. The best way to discover God's plans for you is to invest time learning what God says about you in the Bible.

We are to show our true character, which is the same as our Father in heaven. This means we should be kind to those around us, even when they are unkind towards us. That kindness is part of the fruit of the spirit, which is already inside you as a believer. You can choose to let it out and bless others with it. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.

Faith and fear are opposites. Fear is the emotional component of unbelief and doubt. They go hand in hand. The way to overcome fear is to step into faith. The way we do that is by meditating on the truth until it moves from our minds to our hearts. Studying the Word of God, listening to Biblical teaching, hearing the testimonies of those who have overcome similar challenges are all ways we can build our faith. And in urgent situations, praying in tongues is a powerful weapon to build ourselves up and push away fear. But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and caught him, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?” (Matthew 14:30-31) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #truth #fear #faith #Jesus

God's grace is fantastically beautiful and eternally unavoidable. We can reject it and try to keep God out of our lives, or we can receive it and come to know true peace. Every attempt at ignoring God's overwhelming grace is in reality a hard-hearted rejection. God loves us at our worst, and made a way for us to become our best true selves, the way he created us to be. God's grace is his perfect provision for your every need. Ponder it's beauty. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #Bible #God #love #grace #peace

Perhaps the biggest reason we can have faith in God is because he is trustworthy. As we get to know God's true character, we will naturally begin to trust him more and more. That ability to trust God, to take him at his word, is the basis for our effective faith.

It is the goodness of God that leads people to repentance, not the hammer or the Law, the fear of punishment, or the pain of suffering.

Faith brings the unseen into visible reality. Faith pulls reality across from the spiritual realm into the tangible, physical world. It is concrete and real. The key to an effective faith is believing in things that are true. This is why deliberate Bible study is so vital to us as believers.

Most folks have some understanding that righteousness is a good thing and to be desired. Where it breaks down, even for believers, is that they think it's up to them to do right in order to be righteous. That gets it backwards. The only way to find true peace and rest is to recognize that the righteousness of Jesus  is ours by faith and receive it. Once we stop trying to become righteous and accept the fact that as followers of Jesus we already are righteous, then good works will flow out of that righteous identity we possess by faith. In the way of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death. (Proverbs 12:28) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #truth #Bible #righteousness #life

God has given believers an incredibly powerful tool for building up and encouraging ourselves with praying in tongues. The enemy hates this and does everything he can to convince believers not to pray in tongues. At the same time, when you pray in tongues you keep yourself in the love of God. If you are down, discouraged, or in fear then consider taking some time to pray in tongues today. The Bible says doing so will edify you and build you up! But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

We should not let our soul become anxious or worry about anything.  Our bodies were not designed to handle that kind of emotional stress long-term. Instead, we should pass along those things we worry about on up to God and allow his peace to guard our hearts. Tomorrow’s worries should be today’s prayer requests. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

We can do anything in Christ, but only to the degree our soul is developed to receive it. Our soul is is what determines how much of God we experience. A truly beautiful soul is one that has been transformed by a mind renewed to the ways of the Kingdom of God that are found in scripture. That soul will also be prosperous in all things. Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. (3 John 1:2) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #truth #Bible #soul #beauty

Jesus redeemed us from the curse. As a result, we are blessed with Abraham's blessings because we believe and are in faith. We walk in the blessing of God in the same way Abraham did. Even when he deceived Pharaoh he was blessed anyway. Pharaoh sent him away with tons of goods. Will you believe that truth and receive those blessings? Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us—as it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”— so that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

We all make mistakes and mess up. The natural response when we do is to condemn ourselves and withdraw from God. However God chose you. He chose to to love you at your worst. And he still loves you today, no matter what you do. In fact, he loves you so much there is nothing you can do about it. His love for you will never change. God's love is so overwhelming that no one is beyond its reach, no matter what horrible things they've done. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) via @CharisDumfries #Charis #truth #Bible #God #love #choice

Preparation time is never wasted time. One of the reasons bad things happen is that a person's heart is not prepared ahead of time. We must put the time in to establish ourselves in the ways of the Kingdom of God before challenges come our way. That is the most sure way to overcome this world. It takes effort to maintain your relationship with the Lord. And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.
