What are you digging into this summer?  Sometimes the hardest part of a project is to just get started.  Getting started allows you to gather valuable data / information that just can’t be “figured out,” on your whiteboard or notepad 📝. - What’s that thing you’ve been sitting on? The summer may be the right time to take a small step 👟. - 🤫 The more people who know about your plan, the more likely you are to actually do it (but you didn’t hear that from me, “cause I ain’t one to gossip). #action #plan #Do #act #GetOutTheBuilding #smallsteps #accountability #RunThePoint

Are you looking for space for you next event and are in the greater NYC area?  Checkout this unique spot. #Repost @jjpb (@get_repost) ・・・ Good morning. @thebrooklynbank can be rented for certain events. The space rental goes towards subsidizing  programming for the non profit wing of business. I’m putting together an invite list for an open house to showcase venue for event planners, brand managers, caterers, private chefs, PR reps, artists and other people that may need space. I would greatly appreciate it if you provide contact information for the above mentioned professionals.

A shot on goal is never a bad play.  I care a lot about humans at work and the relationships / connections that are made there.  I was fortunate enough to spend 8 years as a people manager (helped to create peer empowerment groups, co-designed a program for managers and teams who are struggling) and 2 years as an employee brand ambassador at Intel (Yes, that Intel). It’s a space I miss. Like Pooky, “it be calling me.”

Rites of passage for any child of mine. Take ‘em to a subway station in NYC, bring them to the subway map and it’s the moment of truth. The result determines their future. You ask them one question: “WHERE BROOKLYN AT?” - Well done son.  Well done.  You are your father’s son. 😝 🗺 #Brooklyn

Slow day following a late night in Times Square with the wife’s family - We stayed with my sister and my brother, who I haven’t seen in over 5 years, came by.  We had a great talk and took this sibling picture at the end (this is only part of the Bruny crew. I have 3 more brothers). - I drove home to MA and saw that Facebook was like, “it’s your dad’s birthday.” He passed away a number of years ago but I know he was smiling to have a few of his kids together.  He was really big on that. I could hear him saying, “what is half brother or sister. It’s just brother and sister.” Well this pic is dedicated to you pops. Happy birthday. Cc: @vbruny

Post #CrossFit workout selfie. I’m just back into it. This was workout # 4 after several months off (almost a year). - I’m watching other folks throw weight around, that I “used” to do. - I’m quickly reminded that the road to #BringingSexyBack is just that, a road. - I’m on that road, I know it’s a journey and I do what I gotta do, to get where I wanna be. - I’ve got notebook in hand and I’m comparing me to me. Not me of yesteryear, but me of yesterday. - Keep. Getting. Better.

Happy 2yr #Babson work anniversary to me. I’ve learned and experienced so much in a short amount of time; including 1yr and change of the #BabsonMBA (on going), working with folks from around the world and learning a lot about workplace culture and the importance of having friends at work. It’s just the beginning. . Two years ago a friend of mine, ask me to say some MC rhymes...

Look how peacefully he naps. My little angel 😇. That’s what you’d expect to see on Instagram. If only you saw the tantrum this little guy threw before he tantrum-ed hisself to sleep because he wanted me to go get his shoes that he took out the car and placed outside so I could go get them. 🤡 Homie don’t play that. . Lesson: stop comparing your backstage to others front-stage. What you see on social can lead you to think something is wrong with you; well something is, but it’s the same for everyone else...but you ain’t seeing that on social. .

...and then I was asked if we could stop at the park as we headed home from Home Depot. . I wanted to explain softball to him and how it works but I didn’t have paper or the back of a napkin. .

Today’s #BowTieOfTheDay is from @thebkcircus .

I found my iPod Nano (3rd generation) in my car. I searched for it as I needed to hear a little Jay-Z. I continue to find gems 💎 in his music years later after I wrote my first book, “Move the Crowd: 30 Days of Hip Hop Affirmations to Change Your Life,” which unintentionally features many of his lyrics. . That book only has my name on the cover but the project was anything but a solo effort, . From The Partnership Inc. in Boston who let me set up a booth at their event to do market research ✏️ @jefeinoa who encouraged me to go forward with the project and help me to shape the idea for the presentation I would give at colleges ✏️ @donsawyer3 who created the cover because he didn’t want me looking whack ✏️ Emmett Price who showed me what was possible and put in a lot of time editing and serving as my literary advisor and motivator ✏️ Hans for staying up all night with me to make page by page edits ✏️ My wife @globaljieun for encouragement and getting me my first book signing pen ✏️ and to all of those who bought a copy, hired me to speak or just showed me love. #ThankYou

It was great to hear Kathryn Hilderbrand #CEO / #Founder of @GoodClothingCompany drop knowledge for the #BabsonFashionInitiative . She shared ...............................................1️⃣How they got started by recycling bottles and also running a #CrowdFunding campaign (she kept it real on how tough it was to reach their goal)......2️⃣sustainability beyond the material you are sourcing but also the impact on the people 👨🏽‍🌾👩🏽‍🌾 who work in that process and for the transportation system ⛽️✈️🚊🚚 (could you have gotten the same thing closer to home?.................................................3️⃣ How to approach manufacturers 🏭when you are ready to make a long or short run of your product. @WearsWoody was also in the house and schooled us about the allure of thinking direct to consumer only means ecommerce & focusing less on a go to retail strategy and more of a go to market strategy Thanks again for coming to #Babson . #fashion #sustainablefashion #fashionforgood #manufacturing

I call this one, “🎵And when I blow up don’t try and kick it to me later.”........I love my people. I’ve known these guys for over 20yrs and here they are at my son’s 4th birthday party. The gent on the left⬅️ is Joel @startupdadhq . He is out there building his funnel agency and helping clients make 6 figures. The gent on the right➡️ is @annelstephan , a successful attorney running his own shop in NYC. I’ve watched them work and can’t wait for the headlines that they are overnight success.

Always honored to share my experience with Blended #MBA students who are just starting (one year ago I sat the same place they are sitting). It was a good panel. One of the 🔑 takeaways(I always take notes) was remembering to leveraging “I am a MBA student,” to open doors that may have been otherwise closed. #BabsonMBA #TheBowTieFlow

Quick finals break. I call this pic, “He think he slick.” We use #YouTubeKids because it has a timer function. I set it for 1hr but I swear this little guy has been watching for more than an hour.  Come to find out the timer finished and he switched to @netflix . 🤦🏽‍♂️. I don’t know if I should be upset or proud of his ingenuity. He’s lucky I’m working on these finals right now. #fatherhoodislit

This is room 32 a/b at #SMMW18 . It looks empty now but on Wednesday at 4p this will be the site of the Conference Networking for Introvert workshop being held by myself and @jillianvorce .

Today’s #BowTie is one we call “Green Tea.” It was named by my wife and was originally one of her dresses 👗. We extended the life of this piece of clothing so it would not have to hit the #Landfill 🚚 so fast.  Look good and do good. #FashionForGood , that’s how we roll over at TheBowTieFlow.com

Every #BowTie has a story. I didn’t design this one but it saved me when I drove to a conference in #NYC and forgot my dress shirt and bow tie <gasp>. I was able to swing by a local @Marshalls and get both without breaking the bank.  #TheBowTieFlow #Fashion #MensFashion #Accessories #InstaFashion

I’m guilty of always looking forward and wanting to do more.  That leads to forgetting many of the things I’ve done. I found great joy and insight in going through my 2017 calendar week by week and seeing what I accomplished and the people I connected with. I’d recommend doing the same (if you keep things on your calendar). #2017 #YearInReview

Just had to share this one. Lord knows I get way too caught up in how I’m gonna look instead of just getting doing what needs to be done. #Repost @jjpb (@get_repost) ・・・ I am currently juggling 3 seven figure deals that I’m trying to close by the end of this year. Seven years ago today i was trying to get my house out of foreclosure  by peddling hair weaves with a profit of $50 a bundle. Looking at the deals that I’m doing these days, selling bundles of weaves seem pretty ridiculous. I remember going from shop to shop with my bag of hair getting dissed by stylists who treated me like the dude that was coin in selling bootleg DVDs and socks. No respect. I was doing what I had to do to survive. Real estate wasn’t popping, but my bills still needed to get paid. I had no knowledge or background in what I was doing, but still turned out to be one of the top brands in the city at that time. I had a decent run and this hustle kept the lights on until real estate picked up again. Rule number 1 in entrepreneurship is survival. Do what you need to do to stay in the game. Scale back, reinvent yourself, do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do. “If someone would have told them that Jude would sell hair weaves, not in this lifetime, wasn’t in my right mind. Thats another difference that’s between me and them,  i smartened up, opened the market up”. #hustle #entrepreneur #business #tbt

Yesterday, all I was trying to do is take my 5hr Managerial Economics Final exam when....I had to buy ink for my printer so I could print the final at home.  The final starts as soon as you access it on the computer. Then my printer stopped working and I had to download it (which started the clock), run (back) to Staples to print the exam and get my $72 spent for ink. 48 minutes later and 48 minutes taken from my 5hr time cap, I started my exam.

Pit stop on my way to celebrate one of my best friend’s achievement of 10yrs in business. You can’t miss things like this. Make every effort to be there!

A lot of great things happened this weekend at my #BabsonMBA face to face, but what I’m most proud of is helping to get @ciscobrewers beers on the menu at the Bottom Line Lounge in the Executive Conference Center.  You see I love supporting my people and I love supporting products I enjoy (Grey Lady is my favorite). One of my classmates is part owner of the brewery and a cool person.  Please ask for Cisco Brewer by name if you are in the exec center, give it a try and let me know what you think.  Appreciate it.

We went to @homedepot today and built a Christmas tree frame / ornament. We had to take it home to paint it. I told Emerson I don’t know if we have 🎨. Turns out we had paint, but I told him we don’t have the color green to paint the Christmas tree 🎄. His response, “Appa(Korean for dad), we have blue and yellow right? Then we can make green. Stick with me; I’ll take you places.” 😳

This picture right here represents one of the highlights of my #thanksgiving with my family. ➡️In the picture is my wife and my aunt (hopefully you can tell which is which). I could hear the conversation it based on the one I had early that night which went like this: ➡️Aunt: your camera takes better pictures than mine. Please send me the pictures. ➡️Me: (thinking I’m making fun of her) ok I’ll but it on Facebook(Facebook said in my thickest Haitian accent to mimic how she has said it in the past). Aunt: “No,no voye l’sou Whatsapp.” (Translation: naw man, put it on WhatsApp) <she proceeds to wait until I put every pic on WhatsApp>. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Man I love my family and my Haitian roots. Everything is just so much funnier in Creole.

Now y’all know I’m good for a story that involves people. Well let me tell you about this lady here who was one of the first faces I saw today when I went the ERG Summit held at TJX. This is Dr. Beverly “Bev”  Edgehill. As I was walking towards the building I knew she worked at the company and said to myself, “I must send her a message on LinkedIn.” Then I walk in and there she is.  God is good. I first met Bev over 10yrs ago right before I started working for Intel. She was the president and CEO of “The Partnership Inc.” in Boston and I am proud to have gone through that transformative program for leaders of color under her leadership.  She is just one of those women who I look at as an inspiration and provides aspiration. Really great to see you again Bev.

Can’t wait to see this in person. Supporting the institutions that supported me. Football was a big part of my collegiate life. More than most probably know. It’s really were I started to grow (I wasn’t that good in high school or should I say I hadn’t blossomed yet). I was always focused on doing my part and learned that how I did my part was enough to cause change in others. I learned leadership doesn’t have one definition and it definitely changes as you move along in life.  Being in front is one way but another (not mutually exclusive) is to really be the best you that you can be...out loud.  Slowly you can start to help others do the same for themselves. I’ll never forget My coach telling me that I was a leader and others look up to me. Who me? This kid from Brooklyn who was just trying my best and had a love for running around and hitting people and getting hype. Yep. Thanks @hartwickhawks . What you do matters...a lot. #ForEverAnAthlete

This morning’s #workout was fueled by my #HipHopAffirmations #tshirt .  Hip hop affirmations was a movement I started nearly 10yrs ago to leverage the power of hip hop lyrics to move things forward in your life.  1 book, over 365 lyrics and stories shared with the people and countless speeches at schools and conferences. It literally was all a dream...that I acted on with the support of people like @globaljieun @donsawyer3 @inoa1972 to name a few. Fun fact: I spoke at @babsoncollege a good 5yrs before I was hired here. What you dreaming up over there?

Coming out just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness month.  Only 5 were made, only 2 are still available for pre-order. Named "Clarice," after my late grandmother who died from breast cancer. Each pink gingham bow tie was handmade in Hawaii and they started out their life as a button down shirt I owned.

I prefer "batch processing," thank you very much. #leanmanufacturing #IntelAlumni
