What a #office view. A yellow wall. What do you think 🤔 about the new theme? It’s not only a wall, it’s a #yellowwonderwall. There is so much positive energy in it... of course when you like this color 😉And do you know what? In the backyard on the left there are balconies. And the one in the first floor is often crowded  by young people. Today it’s not so hot with max. 22 Celsius w/ 7h of ☀️. ***NEW*** For everyone who is a allergy sufferer: today🚨in #Munich for grasses, plantain and yellow alert for rumex. Stay strong 💪 and yellow 😀‼️

The perspective of being yellow. What do you think 🤔 about the new theme? For me this view is really exciting because you can discover even more than you might think first. Yellow it the color between orange and green. Here we don’t have windows but behind you can imagine a backyard. Today seems everything is yellow and blue cause it’s a great summer day with max. 29 Celsius w/ 12h of ☀️. And it’s our second day in our new office 🙏👍🤙 So I call this pic „yellow wonderwall“. Feel free to comment on it. Really eager to know your thoughts about it.

No open window 🏠but just wait a second☝️Unusual the middle one seems to be open. Great weather today and max. 28 Celsius w/ 11h of 🌤☀️🌤☀️🌤☀️🌤☀️🌤☀️. Today it’s our last day in this office 😢So I call this pic „wonderwall“. From next monday on I will surprise you with a new theme. A lot of people what was really surprising me asked why the hell I took pictures like this? Seriously my answer was that from the 1st time I came into the office I was fascinated by this wall because it’s not typical to have wall outside with a mosaic. Soon when I shared the pics with the new motif - after a long time w/ #isargulls people liked it or asked what it means. Then I realized that you follow me and this brings me to the most important part here and now. THANK YOU 🙏 for being with me, thank you for liking and commenting my pics. I appreciate it. Finally a quote by meditate bot: „Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.“ - Winston S. Churchill

Today it was my 9th time standing next to the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #sunset. Around 6:30 p.m it wasn’t so crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 at all. So I took easily a 📸. This #thursday felt somehow strange cause of headache the whole day but in the afternoon I got my "second breathe" (btw: do English men/women say it like this "german phrase"). This week of April will end with ☀️& 🌡. Relax & stay strong 🦄☀️🌆- you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

Yesterday it was my 8th time standing in the middle of the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #evening lightening. Around 8 p.m it wasn’t crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 at all. So I took easily a 📸 from the middle of the street. This #monday yesterday felt somehow strange cause of headache the whole day and a lot of stuff was going on. But in the evening you could smell the #summer and I saw people first time in shorts and flip flops cause it was so warm.🦄☀️🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

Today it was my 7th time standing next to the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #sunset. The sun looks like greeting me or like „Hey, I make you feel well - believe me, I know about what I speak.“ 😂 Around 5 p.m it was quite crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 at all. So I took a 📸 from the sideway of the street. This friday feels a little bit tired but it smelt like summer.🦄🌤🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

Yesterday it was my 6th time standing in the middle of the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #sunset. Around 6:10 p.m it wasn’t crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 at all. So I took easily a 📸 from the middle of the street. This tuesday yesterday felt somehow like a monday but you could smell the #spring.🦄🌤🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

It's my 5th time standing next to the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #sunset. Today around 5:50 p.m it was some way crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 like yesterday but again I tried it and could take a 📸 from the side. #wednesday feels not so special but I found out that nearly everyday around 6 p.m traffic is more or less high. I could snap the pic but see on after I had to leave cause there was suddenly a car behind me and the driver was not so amused about the fact that this guy in front of him with that red helmet (what is why his colleagues call him „Rotkäppchen“) upon a green bike was not driving but making a picture 🤪 Hope you enjoy the light. 🦄🌤🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

It's my 4th time standing next to the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice light. Last time there was less traffic but today 6:15 in the late afternoon it was some way crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 but I tried it and could take a 📸 from the middle of the street. #tuesday is not such a special day of traffic but I thought I could get a pic because everybody who was driving a car looked a little bit like lost ... driving left and right and so on. Hope you enjoy the light. 🦄🌤🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

It's my 3rd time standing next to the big street w/ my 🚲 & my 📲 in front of our office and there is such a nice light. Last time there was less traffic but today 🕕 in the late afternoon it was really crowded by 🚗 🚙 🚘 so I couldn’t take a 📸 from the middle of the street. #Friday is a special day and you can feel it. More tourists, more traffic, more laughing people and so on. Hope you enjoy the weekend. 🦄🌤🌆 Relax & stay strong - you’re the ONE 👈💪🤙✌️‼️

It's my 2nd time standing in the middle of the big street w/ my 🚲 in front of our office and there is such a nice #sundown. 1st time I did a pic was last week and I posted it via #swarm but today I thought I could give #insta #instagram a chance. Hope you enjoy it 🦄🌤🌆 Stay strong ✌️‼️

No open window 🏠 but wait a second☝️Two windows are open and again the one above on the left side. There lives somebody who needs a long daily breeze of fresh air  I guess without getting a cold. Besides that I ask myself if I should go outside the office for 🥙🍴🥗cause #burglind 🌪💨⛈ is here and becomes heavier more and  more... What do you say? ✅ or ❌?

No open window 🏠 but wait☝️ there is one open on the left side the 1st one at the top. Sometimes I ask myself what I would think if I would live over there 👉 in the „wall“ building... not sure if I would like it but it would depend on the size cause we would live there w/ #Bigfoot & #Littlefeet so at least we would need 3 rooms but I guess the flats over there are smaller... what do you think?

No open window 🏠 but wait. The same like yesterday are open and a 3rd one - right side, 2nd at the top. It's never the same. Never. It's always different. What do you think if you see this pic?

No open windows 🏠 but some different aspects. Did you see the tiles? The whole wall is full of tiles like a bathroom 🛀 in the last decade. Some kind of weird architecture 🙃🤨🤪.

No open window 🏠but a fascinating object. This Wall of tiles is timless. And it doesn't fit into that #munich you already know like #haidhausen, #lehel, #maxvorstadt or #schwabing.

No open window 🏠 but a great moment ☝️. Imagine: Two young boys are downstairs playing ⚽️ against each other. Schools out. Now kick it like Beckham. But in this area of #Munich it would better fit to say “Kick it like Cantona”.

No Isar-gulls 🐥 but a great blue light. Yesterday in the evening I made this last picture. I remember when I began to 👀 for Isar-gulls over a year ago.
