The next chapter begins. Thanks to those who prayed for our father Clint Bain the last two and half weeks. He came home from @orlandohealth stroke recovery with the ability to talk and walk short distances with the aid of a walker. Physical and speech therapy 3xwk to retrain the muscles and memories. Every chapter of life has challenges to create growth and prove our faith to be real. Deep peace for our mother May and my sister Trish tonight as we are each grateful for prayers and the hope of a new day. Those who have watched a parent lose health understand the path we are walking, so keep my mom especially in your prayers as she takes medical time off to help her life partner of 60 years find his way back to strength. #lovestory #strokerecovery #orlandohealth #orlandostrong #walkagain #caregiver #caretaker #recovery

Flashes of light in the darkness- that‚Äôs what Prayer is to me tonight. Grateful for so many friends shattering the darkness in expressing prayer for the continued healing of our father, Clint and energy for his compassionate life partner May.  My parents are my heroes.  Every challenge of life they model faith and our family motto, ‚ÄúWhat would Billy Graham do‚Äù learned from my grandmother.  Dad may go home sometime this week. He is walking with a walker and moving through the brain recovery science here at @orlandohealth . His stroke recovery team are excellent and we are deeply grateful for their care for our father. Several people have asked about sending him get well cards so when he returns home he can be encouraged through the next stage of recovery and continued physical therapy to retrain the brain.

Medical team very pleased with dad‚Äôs progress, which my sister Trish and I attribute to God‚Äôs faithfulness, often shown through the compassionate caregiving from our godly mother May. Deeply grateful for those who have lifted up our father and mother for strength, healing and restoration. Your prayers, kind words and especially stories of how your family member battled back from stroke to full functioning have been so very encouraging. @orlandohealth has been beyond professional in showing compassion and support to help our father get strong again. He may be discharged in a week with continued progress. Thanks and big hugs to so many friends and family for standing with us. üôèüèª ‚ù§Ô∏è #Family #orlandohealth #orlandostrong #loveorlando #orlandounited #stroke #strokerecovery #caregiver #caregiverstress #prayer #restoration

Our dad continues to strengthen after stroke, yet there are still weeks of recovery ahead and many physical skills to regain. Heard the powerful @themercyme song, ‚ÄúEven If‚Äù on @z883fm driving home. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre able and I know you can, save through the fire with your mighty hand. But even if you don‚Äôt, my hope is you alone.‚Äù And cried with the reality that the prayers of so many wonderful friends for healing and restoration of our parents would be wonderful. But ‚Äòeven if‚Äô is the faith that no matter the outcome, we will still trust in our God. Thanks @orlandohealth and @z883fm for adding value to families facing incredible difficulty every day. Deeply grateful. #orlandounited #OrlandoStrong #orlandohealth #z883fm #stroke #family #evenif #mercyme #recovery #restoration #faith

Update- Dad stabilized with a med change. Mom still the amazing (but tired) caregiver at his side. May be another few weeks of care from @orlandohealth  professionals. Headed home tonight with the peace of knowing our father is in good care, and especially resting in knowledge that he is in God's care. Thanks for prayers! #orlandohealth #family #caregiver #stroke

Midnight update. Our father had a draining day of neurological tests to determine damage from stroke @OrlandoHealth Speech unaffected! Left side weak, (especially leg). PT starts Monday to relearn muscle movement and strength. Mom is such a remarkable wife and caregiver. I mist up with tears seeing how well she cares for her husband. #lovestory through every season with those two! If you are a person of faith, prayers for healing, restoration and endurance appreciated; since today we‚Äôre told it could be weeks of intensive treatment to regain/relearn movement.  Deeply thankful for team after team of compassionate techs, MD‚Äôs and AMAZING Nurses caring for Clint and May. My sister Trish and I are so grateful for your thoughts and prayers for our remarkable parents. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª to you all. If we don‚Äôt respond back quickly to your text or message know you are valued and we are thankful. Caring for mom and dad‚Äôs needs are the priority. Still no visitors at this stage, but wish we could come through social medial to hug each of you!  #orlandohealth #OrlandoStrong #Stroke #neurological #recovery #restoration #prayer #prayers #family

Dad's midnight update. Another exhausting day of neurological tests. Still serious with no clear diagnosis or treatment plan.

‚ÄúEven If" is a reminder that in difficult situations that don't seem to go away, God is still worthy. This song is a declaration to God that even if He went silent and never said another word, He's still worthy to be praised and that He's our greatest hope in the midst of the trial." Thank you @timmonsmusic and @officialblanca for a remarkable morning of inspiration during @seaworldorlando 41st Easter Sunrise Service, the 12th year in partnership with @z883fm to share the story of Gods forgiveness and grace. #easter #happyeaster #grace #timtimmons #blanca #z883fm #risen #forgiveness #forgiven #seaworld #sunrise #friends #godisfaithful #evenif

Overcast morning on Orange Avenue where a Terrorist massacred 49 and shot 53. Omar Mateen was killed by SWAT 06/12/16. His story ended in that building along with his victims. His wife, Noor Salman was found ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù 03/30/18. Her story starts again today in CA. The lives of thousands in central Florida may be in limbo, so do this. Get involved. Reach out. Speak up. Invite someone to Easter service. Show a kindness. Model ‚ÄúLove Wins‚Äù to the world. Silence the haters with the compassion of a simple Jewish Rabbi whose teaching changed the world. (Sure changed mine). The world is watching Orlando. I pray we will model what a healing community looks like. #lovewins #orlandounited #orlandostrong #ptsd #ptg #resilience #counseling #change #pulse #loveorlando #community

Wow! Training Florida lawyers in A/I with America‚Äôs top Body Language expert Susan Perfido www.silentmessages.com blew me away!

Www.theJuryLab.com will show her patented science to ‚Äúread‚Äù the real message someone is giving you in less than 1 second. (This could stop cheaters in their tracks, but it‚Äôs designed for lawyers to ‚Äúsee‚Äù when people are lying).

Training counselors with my friend Aaron Norton at @fmhca is always meaningful. He taught on sleep disorders. I taught how to get inside the head of school shooters. To survive a shooting -Run-Hide-Fight (or throw furniture to suppress the assailant. Commit to survival ) #counseling #fmhca #fmhcaannualconference #shooting #training #crisis #schoolshooting #sleep #runhidefight

So excited to read Pat Williams newest book, ‚ÄúLeading Gods Way‚Äù. Rick Warren and dozens of other faith leaders say it is his best yet.

Transformation is what OURmission does hundreds of times per year.  Entire families changed by Biblical counseling and life skill development at an amazing 5 acre campus.  @courtneydawnshaw @WTLN the Salem media Group, Freddy Clayton and my mom, Ms. May (as her residents call her), made the toy drive a success.  Mom‚Äôs and dads (and even the Girl Scouts) came in continually through the radioathon and 70 kids who might have missed Christmas are set.  Even more blessed are the many families who saw this remarkable facility and the even bigger hearts of the staff Like Karla and Juan. Former residents, off the streets and now living in their own homes with their families and come back to help others.  This is community building from deep spiritual change. take a tour with your family to understand how they guide broken homeless families into strong godly ones,  paying their own way in only a year.  This is how to change a community.  One changed heart at a time. #ourm #community #orlando #orlandostrong #faith #change #restoration #mission #wtln #christmas #transformation #loveorlando

One of my favorite things is to equip psychological first responders, like @kimberlym17 one of the premier PTSD specialists in this region.  Is your team prepared?
