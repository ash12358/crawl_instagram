Spaniard @26_danipedrosa announced his retirement from MotoGP at the end of this season today. One thing is for certain, the @motogp grid will be decidedly less interesting without him riding. He‚Äôs retiring as one of the most successful MotoGP riders ever, and arguably the greatest to never win a MotoGP title. Here‚Äôs a shot from the 2017 Grand Prix of the Americas at @cota_official when I was covering the race for @texashighways. . . . . #motogp #cota #AmericasGP #dp26 #danipedrosa #thankyoudani #honda #motorsport #motorsportphotography #dslr #5dmkiii #canonbringit #tbt

Six years ago Jessica and Marcus got married, and I had photographed my first wedding as the primary photographer (though I had photographed a half-dozen or so as a second shooter by that point). Thank you so much to the both of you, and hiring me since then for family photos of y‚Äôall and your extended family. It‚Äôs meant the world to me. I didn‚Äôt necessarily know it at the time but it was a big step along the path I find myself on now. Happy Anniversary!

Going-to-the-Sun Road opened all the way through @glaciernps this past weekend, so I decided to #optoutside and go for a little hike on the Hidden Lake Overlook trail behind the Logan Pass visitors center.

Well, they don't call it "Big Sky Country" for nothing. I couldn't have asked for a better couple than Jaimee and Gavin to kick-off what should be countless weddings here in Montana. They couldn't have been more adorable, and while some early rain delayed the start of the ceremony it cleared just in time, the wind died down, and it ultimately left this sunset in its wake as if to say "Sorry for the rain." Congratulations to you both on such a perfect evening and thank you so much for entrusting @leahlambersonphoto and I to document it. Shout out to @diamondbweddings, @pixelatedgigs, @celebraterentals, @openroadcoffeebus, @skeetercj, @souciesouciesalon, and Be Our Guest Wedding & Event Planning for putting it on! . . . #finallyfalks #montanaweddingphotographer #406wedding #mymontanawedding #weddingphotography #weddingwire #weddingsunset #dslr #5dmkiv #canonbringit

Sunset the night before last. Strict landscape photography‚Äîwhen the landscape is the star versus being a backdrop to the real focus‚Äîis trickier than it looks, and until recently I‚Äôve not really had the opportunity to work on that skill set. I hope to remedy that and then some this summer and fall. Northwest Montana is certainly the place to do so. . . . #montanamoment #visitmontana #406 #montanaphotographer #landscape #whitefishlake #sunset #dslr #5dmkiv

Last night I had the pleasure of being included in a ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô 50th anniversary vow renewal at @lodgeatwhitefishlake. It was just me, the ‚Äòbride & groom,‚Äô their two daughters, and daughters‚Äô husbands. The kids were able to organize the whole thing as part of a planned trip to Whitefish unbeknownst to their parents and they were all just about the sweetest people you can imagine.

An Lunar photographer I am not‚ÄîI wish the focus was a bit sharper than it is on this‚Äîbut I had fun messing around the other night trying to pull details out of the full moon. Was using the @canonusa 100‚Äì400mm f4.5‚Äì5.6L IS II with the Canon 2x Extender III, at maximum zoom for 800mm. I did have more luck than I‚Äôve had in Austin because, well just about anywhere in Montana has less light pollution than Austin. üòÅ . . . #moon #nightsky #fullmoon

I‚Äôve been so fortunate to work with such great couples whom whether we were friends before the wedding or not we usually are afterwards, and @michelleoreos and @atticus8631 are certainly no different. Their lovely, intimate, D.I.Y.  wedding last summer at @southcongresshotel in Austin continues to be the gift that keeps giving in terms of self-promotion as it has gotten picked up by several blogs and wedding inspiration sites, this time by @zola. What is the trick to having your wedding published? Aside from the photos obviously, a great story well articulated by the couple, and a thorough vendor list sure do help. Thank you again to Michelle and Blake, and congrats on approaching your first year of marriage! . . . #zolaweddings #atxwedding #bridesofaustin #weddingphotography #weddinginspiration #weddingphotographer #mw100years #austinwedding #dslr #5dmkiii

In honor of @taylorswift kicking off her tour this week in support of her latest album ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù I figured I‚Äôd do a #tbt to her only live performance of 2016 at the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix at @cota_official in Austin, Texas. I was shooting the concert as part of my coverage of Grand Prix weekend for @texashighways magazine. Fine, I‚Äôll admit I was a bit excited because... well okay those who know me well may very well describe me as a closet ‚ÄúSwiftie‚Äù. But even if you‚Äôre not a fan of her music in general there is no denying that ‚ÄúRed‚Äù and ‚Äú1989‚Äù are basically unassailably perfect pop albums. Don‚Äôt @ me.

Still reviewing weddings I second shot this past fall to pick out some keepers and found lots to love about this wedding out at Kevin Fowler‚Äôs Rustic Ranch wedding venue in Wimberley, TX. I was humbled to be working with one of the most tireless photographers I‚Äôve ever met‚Äî@hellotiffanyphoto‚Äîand it was a blast. Fun vendors, a lovely couple, loving families that already had a close relationship, and one of the more unique cake decorations I‚Äôve come across.

Sometimes when second shooting for another photographer it takes me a while to go back and review my photos, especially when the primary photographer already has all my files there isn‚Äôt any timetable for me to go through them. Here are a few of my favorites from Morgan & Billy‚Äôs wedding late last September at @prospecthousetx down in Dripping Springs, Texas where I had the opportunity to help out @davecmclaughlin. The weather couldn‚Äôt have been better, an extremely easy going couple, and the Texas Hill Country as a backdrop made for some great pictures.

No school for the little today meant a lazy and slow morning getting out of bed.

Back in high school and into college‚Äîduring the early days of widely available public internet‚ÄîI ran and maintained a fan website for the band @revhortonheatofficial. The site is actually still there in its frozen-in-time glory circa maybe the year 2000 or 2001 which was embarrassingly the last time I touched it. Anyway, I was extremely stoked to hear they were coming to Whitefish. How fitting that the first show I would go to in our new home would be the trio from Dallas, Texas. Alas, I underestimated the demographic similarities between Montana and Texas, the size of the venue, and the general lack of population in this part of the country, and even more than a week before the show it was sold out. üòì

As a swimmer growing up in central Texas I was very fortunate to meet several Olympians through the UT swim program and my world class coaches at Texas Aquatics (‚ÄúHi @coachjackroach!‚Äù) and it was always such an inspiration. Today my daughter met her first Olympic athlete as part of the welcome home celebration for @maggie_voisin. Regardless of the direction Hazel‚Äôs life takes her, I hope this meeting helps show her what can be achieved when you work hard at something you love, and don‚Äôt give up. Maggie, thank you for being such a great representative of the @explorewhitefish community and being so giving of your time to help inspire our kids. #hooray4hazel

Living in a new state, in a new city, lends itself to some very definitive ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù for myself and my family. This year was my first‚Äîand I emphasize first because there will be more‚Äîtime witnessing the Penguin Plunge as part of the Whitefish Winter Carnival. The event benefits area Special Olympics athletes, is a blast to watch as people who raised money to participate don costumes and jump into a large hole cut into the ice of Whitefish Lake. Next year I hope to actually participate in the event, so stay tuned! . . . #406 #montanamoment #explorewhitefish #montana #visitmontana #whitefishwintercarnival #dslr #canon #5dmkiv

Filed under "things you don't see in Texas" the family and I checked out the Skijoring competition as part of the Whitefish Winter Carnival. Skijoring involves what amounts to basically an obstacle course where a skier navigates the course while being pulled by a horse. I wasn't shooting the event in any official capacity, but brought my camera along to see if I could capture anything cool. The heavy snow did not disappoint. . . . #montanamoment #406 #explorewhitefish #skijoring #whitefishwintercarnival

As we ring in the New Year and all the promise that brings my family also does so with the realization that it‚Äôll be without my Grammie, who passed away at the age of 97 yesterday. Here she is when she met my daughter for the first time when she was three months old. She was nothing but sweet to me my entire life and was always supportive and the biggest cheerleader for her grandchildren. I think many of my personality traits found their way to me from my mom via Grammie, not the least of which would be the muttering under my breath at my favorite teams or players while I watched baseball, football, basketball, and really just about any televised sports. She followed her Chicago teams‚Äîregardless of sport‚Äîreligiously. One of my fondest memories of her will always be when I was attending EIU, her alma mater in her hometown of Charleston, and she came down to visit to watch one of my swim meets. We drove past her childhood home, and ate dinner and visited with some of her childhood friends. I love and miss you Grammie, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre reunited with Pops, and get to spend his birthday with him today.

Story time! Although I was born in central Illinois I grew up in central Texas so when I attended Eastern Illinois University I‚Äôd never been exposed to anyone wearing @carhartt brand gear, especially the winter clothing. My first winter at school one of swim teammates was wearing a stocking cap bearing the recognizable logo and I inquired about it. He informed me that true northerners, particularly those of the farming and ranching variety buy and wear Carhartt. Here we are more years later than I care to count and I find myself living in northern Montana, and needing true winter weather gear. My father-in-law obliged this Christmas by getting us all Carhartt jackets. I feel like just maybe I‚Äôll be able to fit in up here this winter, and my daughter gets an early start on knowing the appropriate, practical clothing to wear as well. Merry Christmas everyone! . . . #hooray4hazel #dslr #5dmkiv #notasponsoredpostbutiwouldntturndownanoffer

Reasonably sure this is looking North towards Glacier National Park, though I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre looking at the Park hear. This was my first time flying into Kalispell from somewhere other than Denver, Seattle, or Boise. Due to flight snafus and mechanical issues we ended up flying in from Minneapolis, and while flying into this corner of the country is really amazing no matter your approach, this one was truly something. . . . #mountains #snow #landscape #montana #406 #iphoneography

This is Algernon, and he dislikes the cold. He dislikes wearing doggy jackets even more. He is totally paralyzed as soon as he‚Äôs wearing something no matter how loose or how snug.

The perks of doing a bridal session post-wedding are that I get to share the photos basically right away, and the groom gets to tag along to offer assistance holding drinks, purses, fixing the dress' train, facilitating truly candid smiles from the bride, and guarding the door to the women's room while you photograph the bride in the lounge area because the wall tile is just that amazing (not shown). #mw100years . . #austinweddingphotographer #austinbridal #southcongresshotel #austin #bridalshoot #weddingphotography #dslr #canon5dmarkiii #canon #5dmkiii

It's been a rough couple of days for this little one post tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, but sometimes all it takes is a push-up and a dandelion to brighten your day. #ilovemyhannas #hooray4hazel

Got to take part in dropping my daughter of at school this morning, and since she genuinely enjoys it, it was a lot of fun. #hooray4hazel

Three has been rough around here. On the munchkin and on mommy and daddy. Here she was telling me "I just want to be left alone for a few minutes." Largely out of nowhere. I'm glad she can express her feelings and emotions, but worried because they seem so intense. What happens when she's a teenager? #hooray4hazel
