#Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom he predestined, he also called; and these whom he called, he also justified; and these whom he justified, he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him over for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?‚†Ä ‚†Ä Today we come to one of the most sweeping and most loved promises in all the Bible, Romans 8:28: 'And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.' Perhaps more than any other promise in the Bible this verse has helped people trust God through experiences that seemed utterly pointless and painful and evil. People have held fast to the 'all things' and believed the word of God ‚Äî this too, this terrible thing, this seemingly pointless thing, will turn out for my good. Years ago I taught the Bethlehem children ‚Äî and all the childlike ‚Äî to say,‚†Ä ‚†Ä When things don‚Äôt go the way they should,‚†Ä God always makes them turn for good.‚†Ä ‚†Ä Christians believe that, sooner or later, the sorrows and pains and disappointments and losses will work together for good.‚†Ä ‚†Ä I know that the translations differ here a little bit. But I don‚Äôt think the differences are serious. The NASB makes God the subject of the verb and 'all things' the direct object: 'God causes all things to work together for good.' The NIV also makes God the subject but makes 'all things' the sphere of his working, not the object: 'In all things God works for the good.' The King James and the English Standard Version make 'all things' the subject: 'All things work together for good.'"‚†Ä ‚†Ä #pain #sorrow #grief #healing #recovery #joy #hope #faith #God #Jesus #disappointment #anxiety #fear #dontgiveup #keepmovingforward #bebrave #brave #courage

Concerning letting boys fail...from @traillife. Spot on concerning how imperative it is that we allow failing moments to occur, and to not shame our boys, but train them up to look to God to help them through these moments. Failure isn't the problem. Failing to walk through failing moments, in a healthy manner, with them is the problem. Parenting addresses the deepest part of our lives, my friends. In such, it is for us to learn and grow with our kids and healthily do what we can to help our children learn. They rely on us to help them to learn where thier true authority is, and that failing moments do not define them...but only God, in Christ, does. #failing #failure #parenting #boys #raisingmen #boymom #TrailLifeUSA #TrailLife #LetBoysBeBoys #God #Jesus

Wrapping up June...and 4th grade History and Science this week. Then another week off for the 4th...then finishing up 4th grade vocab, spelling & litature art for the rest of July into early August...hopefully wrapping up by the first full week. I'm glad we took our time to finish, as it's given us plenty to do during the summer while giving us flexibility to take time off other times of the year. This is one of the beautiful abilities of homeschooling that I am greatful for. We both need to stay on somewhat of a schedule for us to be able to be sane through the summer. We have fun built in, too, daily with a fun activity to do after school and chores are done. Afternoons are reserved for practice and relaxing. These planners help us out so much, too. I use my phone calendar a lot, too. But to write it down gives it substance for us both. It is quite satisfying picking up a pen and check marking items as they're completed. üòÅ And I love the updates in the new Student Planner (great separation for daily assignments, practices and chores) and the planner for me (an added "Self Care" area is now on it. üëçüëç) These planners are well worth the investment, mamas!

Our heads may be easily perted from the depth of our guilt, but our hearts are not so lightly healed. And we all know deep down there is something inauthentic about the self-asserting, dollar-hungry, intimidating executive who meets you at the top. We know alcohol and drugs and compulsive entertainment and noise are not the way to life and peace. And we ought to know, who have heard the gospel of Jesus Christ, that the debt we owe to God cannot be paid off by our paltry virtue.‚†Ä ‚†Ä But instead of trying to show the inadequacy of all this, I want to build on what we began in the last two messages. The point of the last two messages was that the biblical portrait of Jesus is true. It is historically rooted and defensible. And it is rationally compelling to the open mind. No man ever spoke like this man, Jesus (John 7:46). He can be trusted. He is true. He endorsed the Old Testament, and it is he who speaks by his Spirit in the New Testament. Therefore, it is enough for us to hear from him through his apostle, Paul, how God has dealt with our guilt. It is the best news in all the world. It is the only strategy that owns up to the truth of God‚Äôs righteousness and the depth of our debt before him. Once you have been grasped by God‚Äôs way of dealing with your guilt, every other way will seem thin and superficial and utterly inadequate by comparison.

Last year, during this time, I worked on my 4th inventory since beginning my recovery journey nearly 10 years ago. Throughout life, even if you don't come from an abusively dysfunctional background of any kind, this step is essential in everyone's life. The inventory process quickly became my favorite step, which baffles many because it can be a very painful process. But I've found value in going through this pain due to what I found on the other side of it each time I've gone through it. The first time was arduously painful. I came to a complete breaking point halfway through it where I finally experienced what I always longed for: what a relationship with God looks like. From there, I've been building that relationship with Him since. The second inventory, therefore, wasn't as arduous...and the third was less as well. And last year, I celebrated with joy far more than feeling any pain going through the inventory. The inventory must be kept balanced, though, in order for it to be successful. Going through the program found through the ministry of @celebraterecoveryofficial will help anyone do this well with proper sponsoring and accountability. I highly encourage everyone to take a moment to take full inventory of your life so as to reflect on the way God is in the midst of it all. It's it worth the process...I promise. I speak from consistently living through this experience. #recovery #inventory #step4 #slowdown #life #fear #pain #anxiety #abuse

Truth! At times (like yesterday morning), I will wake with irrational fears in my head. Usually this happens when I am about to do something that follows the direction of God's leading for my life. The worst case scenario plays out in my head like a horror movie (hence why I don't watch horror movies. My head plays its own variety of them quite well, at times.), and I am tempted to isolate and stay home. But through recovery and counseling, and my insistence to be stubborn against those fears by chasing God through His word, God has taught me how to combat these fears by putting His word into action. Faithfully, in Christ, I pray and repent for even  for the one second that I buy the enemy's lies, and then I reach out to healthy accountability to share transparently my struggle and ask for prayer. Relief from the tempation to continuing buying the lies doesn't always come immediately, but it does usually subside as I keep moving forward [faithfully] toward what God is directing me to do. The point? Fight fear with faith, in Christ, my friends. The enemy is the author of confusion, and will decieve your mind any chance he can get. The enemy knows our weakest areas, just as God does; though, the enemy's plan is to find ways to confuse our minds to distance us from God. Don't buy his lies, friends. Fight by confessing to God your hurts, hangups, habits and even wrongdoings, leaning on Christ, being transparent with safe people and asking them for prayer. From there, keep moving forward.

Oomph! I did it though. My head has been in a horrible place the last few weeks. I've been struggling through the plank challenge...almost done, and about to repeat it. But I cannot complain about a 7 or 10 min workout for my day. This just kicked my behind. I will aim to work at this 3 times a week right now. Whew! Lots of modifications...but still stretched me where I'm at right now. The aim is to complete this workout without any modifications and without needing to take any breaks in the middle of the active exercise. I'll get there...getting my head right first, and proceeding forward.

So, yesterday was the 21st anniversary I moved to NC. Wow. Just over half my life has officially been lived here in NC. And back when I first moved here from Tucson, AZ, I never thought I'd acclimate to the point I'd love it here. It was difficult for me to adjust to the culture of this area, which truly is drastically different from the West coast, particularly the Southwest. The pace of life, how it's lived, the community of people and how they interact, and the general culture I grew up in in my youth was challenged by a new way when I was in my young 20's...and it took me about 2 solid years before I could even understand someone over the phone to order a pizza. üòÜ * In looking back to that time, I can see how immature I was in how I handled it all. Amdist the spiritual upheaval I encountered in my life as I chose to venture away from God completely, seeking how to connect with Him on my own terms, through my own ways, in various New Age ways, I never realized the drastic change of moving from the Southwest to the Southeast would provide me the ample opportunity to meet God in the midst of my ugliest, darkest moments. But I did, and He used all this change in my life over 20 years ago to bring about the change I deeply desired in my heart since I was 13 to have a relationship with Him. It took until I was 26 to find myself at His feet, and accepting Him fully into my life in Christ, but it happened. And it all happened because He took me out of the environment that stagnated me. I was comfortable in it. I didn't want to leave it. It was familiar. And it was in the wilderness that He let me go through discomfort, physically & spiritually, where I discovered I truly, deeply desired God. And I found my way to Him. * I'm so thankful He allowed me to wander as I did. It's not an avenue I advocate to anyone to take, but my testimony is one that shares His hope in the wilderness moments of life. * Friends, He is always with you. Never leaving nor forsaking any of His children. The wilderness, the changes of life, are opportunities for us to meet Him right in the middle of our mess. Don't miss the blessing when changes occur in your life. Because you'll miss Him. üíô

What's great weekend with our Trailman with his @traillife troop. We hated to leave. Camping and hiking with family + friends as close as family = one great weekend. Can't wait until our troop biking trip this fall!

Spot. On. #codependency #guilt #shame #anxiety #narcissism #recovery #MarySpirit #MarthaSpirit ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "Serving those we‚Äôre unwilling to disappoint can be a very bad thing, even a tyrannical thing, if our loves are idolatrous. If, whether out of anxiety, selfish ambition, narcissism, or some other sinful love, we are motivated by someone else‚Äôs approval over God‚Äôs approval, our service can become our destruction.‚†Ä ‚†Ä And the thing is, like Martha, we might not be fully cognizant of our own motives. We might think we‚Äôre doing good things when we‚Äôre not. One indicator to look at is how often we feel 'anxious and troubled.' Notice I didn‚Äôt say 'weary.' It‚Äôs clear from the New Testament that a heavy workload, and even suffering and persecution, can be given to us by God. But an anxious, troubled spirit might mean what‚Äôs motivating our busyness are efforts to please the wrong persons.‚†Ä ‚†Ä If that‚Äôs true, we‚Äôre likely due for a reevaluation of our time commitments. We should ask the Holy Spirit to search our hearts and try our thoughts (Psalm 139:23). We should ask ourselves the hard question: who are we willing to disappoint? Or who are we unwilling to disappoint? Are we unwilling to disappoint God? Are we unwilling to disappoint others? Are we unwilling to disappoint our own selfish preferences? These questions can help us untangle motivational knots.‚†Ä ‚†Ä And if we‚Äôre tempted to avoid facing the answers, let‚Äôs remember that life is too short and God is too precious to give our years and our strength to the fear of man. Joshua exhorts us from the ancient past: 'Choose this day whom you will serve' (Joshua 24:15). Let‚Äôs respond with him, 'We will serve the Lord' with all our heart and soul in the gladness of love-inspired fear (Deuteronomy 10:12; Psalm 100:2)."‚†Ä ‚†Ä Read more on #linkinbio @desiringgod

Yep, we do. Not every mom does, but those who do...we do. And as my son nears transitioning over to Navigators soon (Middle School aged patrol), I will only enjoy camping with him when we camp as a family and on trooowide family trips. But that's all good. He needs to learn how to grow as the man God made him to be that he is step by step becoming. I am greatful God gifted me to be a mom to a son.

This time of year, I see a dramatic division reveal itself between men and women. Mother's Day is touted as the day mom's need to be treated like queens and do nothing for a whole day. While Father's Day is touted as the day father's need to spend time with this children. ‚Ä¢ The message here is very divergent from the idea God has in mind for family. As a mom, I don't want a while day out of the year that I get to check out on my family and not do anything at all for them. And my husband doesn't want just one day out of the year where he gets to spend time with us. No. ‚Ä¢ The words I typed in the image above are messages sent to mom's around this nation around this time of year to be put on pedastals. Ladies, I get it. We do...a lot. We give our guts out to our families, children, churches, communities, work, etc. We are tired. We aren't thanked a whole lot, and we do need to take care of ourselves. (Same for husband's and father's) But...a BIG but here...not at the expense of our families (including the covenant families we are a part of). ‚Ä¢ Being a mom is a tough job. So is being a dad. Being a parent is at times a tough, hard, back breaking, heart wrenching, tear jerking escapde in the journey's of our lives. Ladies, we are not above our husbands...and guys, you are not above us. We are in this parenting gig together. Arm in arm. 100%/100%. It's a team effort, and our kids need us both giving our all's. In turn, we need to give the same effort in our marriages. ‚Ä¢ This Mother's and Father's Days, I challenge us (wives and husbands) all to do something different. Do something that celebrates the joys of being parents, enjoy our children (no matter how old they are), and enjoy being with our spouses. In turn, what would that look like if we adopted that as much as possible into our everyday lives in our families? #MothersDay #FathersDay #mom #dad #parenting #beateam

Why didn't anyone get me the memo that after 40, your sciatica can act up - derailing you from strenuous activity for a week at times? ü§®üòê Oh, well. Not giving up. No sirree. I'm back at it tonight, and tomorrow will be a @fitnessblender 10 min routine to get me back into the swing better. Getting my steps in lately though. Ladies, if you're in the fight to get healthy and/or lose weight, and if you have PCOS or any other condition that thwarts your weight in any way, don't give up the fight. Keep moving forward. If you happen to get bucked off the horse once in awhile, rest...and then get back up on that horse and keep going. #fitness #exercise #homeschool #homeschoolfitness #homeschoolmom #PCOS #over40andfit #over40 #dontgiveup #keepmovingforward #planks #plankchallenge

Yeah. It's never a good idea to shove problems under the rug. To forget about them. And doing so in the name of "forgiveness." Forgiveness doesn't forget anything ever happened. No, it recognizes something's been done wrong - either to you, or you did something to yourself or someone else. But it doesn't hold power over you any longer. Forgiveness frees us from the bondage of fear, pain and problems. And the only way to experience this is by facing fears, problems and pains straight in the face and then turning it all over to the only One who can handle it all (because He died for it all): Jesus. I am thankful to the Lord for my recovery, in Christ. I am greatful to Him for how He's used @celebraterecoveryofficial in my life to help keep me accountable to constantly face my fears, pains and problems, turn them over to Him and move on in forgiveness because He first forgave me (as He did us all, in Christ Jesus)! #recovery #abuse #childhoodabuse #freedom #forgive #forgiveness #nolongeravictim #Jesus #God #faith #hope #anxiety #depression #addiction #problems #pain #fear #fears #hurts #hangups #habits ‚Ä¢ (Below you'll find info about my friend @johnnybaker's new book you can preorder right now.

I share this not because my human personality identifies with this type, and therefore treat me with kid gloves. No. Not at all. Yes, I identify with this personality type (MTBI it's also the ISFJ), but I share this to mainly point out that understanding a human personality type of someone else (even as a Christian) can help us have better relationships. I must always keep in mind I will meet other people with a type 6 personality (or ISFJ), therefore I must treat them as I want to be treated as well. In turn, to always treat others (even my own and husband and son) the way I'd like to be treated; but be aware not everyone will treat me well. So I am learning to expect others, at times, will make fun of me, and joke at me at the expense of my confidence in The Lord. But this is where Eph 6 helps. Concerning  people with this personality type (which is the human personality type I do have), doesn't equate to making jokes at them. People who have a type 6 personality are extremely sensitive to being lumped as something they've done that's silly or mindless. These people are not (none of us, even other types) what they do. They are human, they goofup and have silly moments. Lightheartedly joking about choices or behaviors that are silly, that's cool. People with this personality type can - and do - laugh heartily at such joking, and even laugh at themselves quite easily. But if you'd like to have a good relationship with someone with a type 6 personality, please exercise restraint from laughing at someone with this type of personality at the expense of thier confidence in who they are in The Lord, and the satsifcation you gain from that kind of joking. And a good thing to keep in mind, really no one (with any personality type) I believe deals well with this. But with the type 6 personality, it's a bit more sensitive than the others. #relationships #boundaries #friends #family #friendship ‚Ä¢ #Repost @yourenneagramcoach „Éª„Éª„Éª #enneagram #yourenneagramcoach #Christianenneagram #enneagramcoaching #Enneagramcoach #shereadstruth #hereadstruth #nashville #franklintn #type6 #enneagram6 #enneagramtype6 #2018 #showmelove #love

Yes! As not just a wife, but also a mom of a boy who will one day be a man...and a husband...yes! #men #women #husbands #wives #sons #boymom ‚Ä¢ #Repost @wholemagazine „Éª„Éª„Éª DO YOU TREAT YOUR HUSBAND LIKE A ROBOT? ‚Äî ‚ÄúIt is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.‚Äù Proverbs 25:24 ‚Äî As women, we sometimes forget or ignore that though our husbands aren‚Äôt wired like us; they still experience fear, pain, rejection, and many other feelings. They, too, are emotional beings created in the image of God. ‚Äî Consider how terrible you would feel if your husband didn‚Äôt consider your emotions. It would eat at us like termites! Most of us would probably explode into some sort of crying mess. While men may not scream at us and run away to cry on their bed (totally guilty), they still feel the rejection of our nagging words, and the weight of them can crush their spirit. We may not find them weeping in the bathroom eating ice cream, but we very well could find them shutting down on the inside. ‚Äî Your husband is not a robot, but if you want him to become one, keep on pretending he can‚Äôt feel pain. Continue to act like you‚Äôre the only one in your marriage who is capable of having a broken heart. Over time, you‚Äôll get your robot, manufactured straight from your grumbling spirit. Congratulations, you‚Äôve just destroyed the communication in your relationship. ‚Äî When a wife complains to her husband about finances, discontentment with their home, etc., these are direct blows to his heart. They tell him he‚Äôs not doing a good enough job as a provider. They crush his spirit and only inspire frustration and fear in his mind. Most husbands work hard to be a good leader and provider for their families. They want to be successful in this God given task. As wives, our words are weighty in the lives of our men. And our words can either speak life or death, encourage or cut down, heal or break. I want mine to be words of life, encouragement, and healing. It‚Äôs time we start building our men up rather than cutting them down to size. // @brittleeallen ‚Äî #wholemagazine #wellwateredwomen

Did a :45 sec plank (3 sets)...and failed halfway through the last one. But I finished it up. ‚Ä¢ Progress...not perfection. ‚Ä¢ I didn't wind up in the [lack of] shape I am in right now overnight, and it won't take overnight to get myself back in shape. ‚Ä¢ I also did a 10 min workout with inclined pushups, squats and low-jacks (modified jumping jacks - less impact on the knees until the knees are strengthened). So I am extending myself some grace and not beating myself up. ‚Ä¢ Failure is the biggest part of progress, for without it, there would be no resistance to strengthen us. Failure is merely a sign of strength developing. Our human minds will easily buy into the lie that failure is final. The end. And there is no grace whatsoever to develop to a better place. ‚Ä¢ Don't buy the lies, friends. Accept that failure is a part of our human lives, and allow it to be a tool that the Lord can use to strengthen you in Him, rather than debilitate you at the cost of the enemy giggling at you with glee. ‚Ä¢ #fail #failure #progress #perfect #perfection #perfectionism #progressnotperfection #planks #plankchallenge #fitness #exercise #over40andfit #homeschoolfitness #homeschoolmom

Went for a little stroll to get my steps in, and fitness walking in. About to get my planks done for today (a rest day for them tomorrow!), and I am just heading to bed soon greatful for God, my salvation in Christ, and the beautiful things He gifts our lives with (including friends who are as close as family). Tonight's walk brought beautiful reminders of His grace, love and mercy. Here are a few captures. #thankful #gratitude #God #Jesus #sunset #church #butterflygarden

The notes in the ESV Study Bible reveal the truth concerning prosperity and success, and I am thankful The Lord brought this wisdom to mind a handful of years ago to help me remember that prosperity and success is not measured by any amount of earthly money or accolades achieved and recieved. I love how the study notes are written to help clarify things here: ‚Ä¢ "Fortified by these assurances of the Lord's abiding presence, Joshua is empowered to recieved his commission with courage. The Hebrew terminology used in these assurances has nothing to do with wordly wealth or worldly success, but has everything to do with accomplishing ones mission [seeking to glorify God] and acting with keen insight in any circumstance that presents itself. Only when one fails to 'ask counsel from the LORD' is such insight lacking." ‚Ä¢ I am going to dig deeply into these verses and examine the Hebrew words used, and break down each word used, to gain deeper clarity. It's what I do; it's what I was taught to do in college. üòÑ And I love doing this. It's like an archeological excavation scene for me, only it's God's word...and I've found the benefits of digging in this way. It takes time. Sometimes, more time than I have to give in any given day due to schedules and appointments. But this is where I take a chunk at a time, for small periods of time, and just dig as I go along for days on end. ‚Ä¢ Friends, be encouraged...from the Lord's Word: do not *be* frightened. Do not BE. That means, don't become the fear(s) you will feel. Lean on His truth that He will be with you, and listen to...obey...His direction, through His Word (guided by the Holy Spirit)...and He will make your paths straight (Provide 3:6), and all you do shall prosper - for His glory, and your good, according to His will (Jer 29:11, Rom 8:28,  Ps 37:4). #scripture #Bible #God #GodsWord #Jesus #encourage #encouragement #success #prosperity #truth #truthtrumpsfeelings #identity #fear #anxiety #worry #faith #brave #bravery #courage #courageous #bebrave #livebrave

Getting too dark to walk outside, so took to the treadmill. Not bad. Stayed within my target heart rate for the most part...went above a few times. Between this and the planks, feeling good today! #homeschoolfitness #homeschoolmom #walking #fitness #exercise #cardio #health #over40andfit

Who's up for a plank challenge? Even on days that you don't feel good, planks can be done. Each day for doing these, 3 sets need to be accomplished. They don't need to be done back to back. They can be spaced throughout the day. But no less than three sets can be done in a day, and actually, no more. This isn't a, "beat your body into submission to the point you hurt yourself" challenge. No. This is a, "how far can you mentally push yourself" challenge. I'm starting today. Who else wants to join the challenge? #plank #plankchallenge #over40 #over40andfit #women #fitness #health #strength #strengthtraining #noweights #exercise #mentallystrong #challenge #homeschoolmom #homeschoolfitness

Researched about workouts for women over 40 (I'll be 41 in June), and I created a circuit that can be modified with various body work exercises (no weights, or free weights to replace not having equipment). Tonight's ciricut was Inclined pushups, modified mountain climbers and squats. Did 3 sets of 8-10 each. Tomorrow is planking and walking to get a mix of cardio and strength in...and I'll alternate like this for the weeks ahead. ‚Ä¢ I discovered that in reaching 40, women's bodies (and even men's) don't respond to a lot of cardio well. It causes far too much coritsol (stress hormone)  to be released. With strength training and building of muscle, and some simple cardio (walking, hiking and the like) throughout the week, the cortisol doesn't become a burden on the body. And at this stage of the game, hormones fight back with a vengence (especially on women). ‚Ä¢ If you're a woman or man over 40, research what exercises and different plans to work into your routine. I thought to take up running, but I am not putting myself in a position to harm myself. Alternating walking, hiking, biking and strength circuit training is a good combo and will help me avoid harming myself - which derailed me many times before. Keeping my eye on my form, keeping to a healthy rep set, and not overdoing the walking, hiking or biking. But I will challenge myself and aim to always do better. It's beyond time to take care of one of His temple's (the only one I can take care of - mine). #fitness #homeschoolfitness #homeschoolmom #over40 #women #exercise #anxietyrelief

Did this today, plus climbed the stairs in our home multiple times for my cardio for 10 mins. and then finished off with a set of 3x :45 sec planks. I feel sore, but I'd rather feel this sore than aching like I was a few short days ago before I started back to working out. There's something to be said about that John Mellencamp song back in the 80's...it hurts so good! üòÑ (Totally different hurt here though üòÜ, although, still relevant. üòÑüòÅ) #fitness #workout #stairs #homeschoolfitness #homeschoolmom #anxietyrelief

After some carbs today, it felt good to get a good dose of protien. And I have to say, this is a great combo right here. After a stomach bug a couple of months back, I've been unable to drink dairy (I can eat whole milk yogurt, cheese and butter, but not anything liquid dairy). In turn, I also discovered I can't digest soy milk either. I tried various kinds of pea protien milks and powders in lieu of dairy (whey) and soy...and I found my powder. Can't go wrong either for the price. Mixed with this Almond/Coconut Milk blend and a packet of this stevia blend with eyrthriol, I have to say...yummy. Quite yummy. Now off to do some walking on the treadmill tonight, and to get some :45 sec planks in. üòÅ

Amen. #weakness #strength #God #Jesus #recovery #hope #faith #addiction #dontgiveup #keepmovingforward #bebrave #livebrave #courage #brave ‚Ä¢ #Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "God has given you so many limitations because he loves you. He wants you to experience as much of his love, in as many ways as possible. And for that to happen, he must provide you a never-ending river of reasons, and an enormous range of diverse ways, to receive and give love.‚†Ä ‚†Ä And this is just what he‚Äôs done! He has made you a very limited part of his body, the church, and he places you with other parts that are also very limited in different ways (1 Corinthians 12:18, 27). As the interdependent parts work together, the whole body functions (Romans 12:4‚Äì5) and it displays the love of God (John 13:34‚Äì35). Your unique strengths and weaknesses are indispensable gifts to this body. Without them the whole body suffers because unique expressions of God‚Äôs gracious love will be missed.‚†Ä ‚†Ä If you‚Äôre frequently discouraged over your limitations, it‚Äôs an indicator that you‚Äôre looking at yourself from the wrong perspective, and looking at yourself too much. You‚Äôre not seeing what God sees; you‚Äôre likely feeling discontent from comparing yourself to other people, other parts of the body.‚†Ä ‚†Ä A wonderful treatment for such discouragement is prayerfully meditating on 1 Corinthians 12 and 13. And also it‚Äôs likely time to reframe the question from 'Why can‚Äôt I be more like that?' to 'What opportunities is God giving me in my limitations to experience more of his gracious love?'‚†Ä ‚†Ä Because the truth is, you are so limited because you are so loved."

In our own humanness, our sin, we cannot ever forgive. But because Jesus forgives us, we now have the capacity to extend His forgiveness to others. And this includes extending this forgiveness toward ourselves for the sins we commit and recognize and repent to God for. #recovery #abuse #narcissisticabuse #forgive #forgiveness ‚Ä¢ #Repost @wellwateredwomen „Éª„Éª„Éª "When we forgive, we participate in the sufferings of Christ and know the costliness of loving broken people. A heart that forgives is a heart that truly realizes the benefits of Christ‚Äôs salvation, experiencing the peace and the joy God has already made available to His children. A heart that forgives is a heart that discovers a deeper life, a fuller freedom. A heart that forgives is also a heart that is able to live genuinely and vulnerably with others." - @karajholmes Forgiveness is one of those topics my heart normally steers away from because I know the depths of hurts we have all felt. However, when we look at forgiveness through the lens of the cross and the gospel of Jesus Christ, it takes on a whole new meaning. We forgive in His strength because of what He has done for us! We forgive because we have been forgiven our greatest sin debt. We forgive because Christ modeled forgiveness for us. This week my sister wrote a two-part series on the "why" and the "how" of forgiveness. You can find it on the #wellwateredblog at the link in profile! How is Christ calling you into freedom today through the act of forgiveness? May we look to the cross always as our guide, knowing that we are free already in Jesus.

As I've engaged in scripture writing this month, the focus has been about being aware of false teachers - particularly in The Church. And this morning, after much grieving and venting last night to my husband about the anxiety and fear I feel over selling off all these Apple products that we have, the Lord led me to a conviction. ‚Ä¢ The selling off these items has replaced Him in my life due to a significant fear of debt like I was raised with, within my own family of origin. The fear that if we could just get out from under all debt we do have in our lives, things would just, "be better. More joyful. More happy. We wouldn't worry for anything." ‚Ä¢ All these thoughts? Lies. ‚Ä¢ As pious as it sounds from a Christian stating, "we are debt free!", the reality is, we can easily create a god (an idol) from this; and in turn, encourage others to do the same. ‚Ä¢ Alas, yes, debt is not something God likes. It is something that is attached to our sinful nature's, but the reality that anyone has debt, even as a believer, doesn't make them any less of a believer. ‚Ä¢ To be a believer, is to trust God through the hard times as well as the good times. It's to trust God, in Christ, that He's redeemed all the powers of sin in our lives; but as we still live human lives, we will still struggle with the sin nature that is a part of our flesh. Therefore, there will be consequences we endure as humans not to punish us, but to sanctify us. ‚Ä¢ Debt can truly be used as the firey furnace thay God uses to sancitify us; to bring us closer to, and deeper, in Him. Encouraging us to ever more rely only on Him and His perfection. ‚Ä¢ Many in the church today carry the label of "debt free" as a badge of honor, that honestly isn't the badge needed to be worn. Only Christ is to be our badge. Our honor. Our joy. Our hope. Not a lack of debt in this natural world. Because the reality is, in this world, we will always experience some kind of debt. But who we rely upon, who we trust in (Jesus), that has broke the bondage of that debt for eternity is what will bring us joy, hope and peace. (Continued in comments) #idol #idolatry

I'm nearly 41 years old, and honestly, I never would have thought simple bakeware would've come with instructions. Sincerely, never. And as I took off the labels of two new stainless steel muffin pans I picked up super cheap at Target today, preparing for making cupcakes for my son's upcoming birthday, I found tiny print scrawled on the back. And as I read it, I learned so much in how to care for stainless steel. More than I knew before reading it a few moments ago. And it dawned on me... ‚Ä¢ ...how much more simple would our lives be if we 1) took the time to locate and read the finely printed instructions of life (the Bible) and 2) apply it as it states to do (without adding or substracting from it)? ‚Ä¢ I began to think on this, and still am, because for years I've evidently been totally messing up my stainless steel cookie sheets by not washing them properly. But I never read the instructions, and will need a couple of new ones soon because of not taking care of them well. ‚Ä¢ How much more true is this also in our own lives when we neglect to read the Bible AND apply what we read to our lives? Knowing generally what scripture (God's words...His voice) says is awesome. But the enemy and his demons even know His word. Knowing something - especially God's word - is only part of the battle. The other part, is actually applying it by trusting it. By trusting Him. But following what He says, and not talking back to Him...nor trying to figure out how to live life on our own understanding. ‚Ä¢ I had no idea God would use directions on a muffin pan label to remind me to not just read and know His word...but to live it...to trust it...to follow it...daily. ‚Ä¢ Going to go process this more. #bible #scripture #thebible #God #Jesus #JesusChrist #GodsWord #trust #truth #faith #bakeware #muffinpan

Someone in Sunday school yesterday shared this, and it's stuck in my head, "Nothing truly happens to us in Jesus; but instead, for us." ‚Ä¢ I deeply value this, because really, the things that happen "to us" aren't intended to attack specifically us. In our sinful nature's, we're merely the pawns the enemy uses in an attempt to attack God. To harm Him. Yet, everything the enemy throws our way, God turns around and uses it for our good and His glory - reminding the enemy of Who's in control, and Who already won. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôå ‚Ä¢ Remembering this truth. Resting in this peace. This relieves so much anxiety about life, and allows us to rest in the hope we all have in His promise to return soon. ‚Ä¢ Until then...as one of my favorite people say in one of his songs, "Move, keep walking. Soldier keep moving on." (@officialtobymac) #awtozer #tozer #quote #God #Jesus #Christ #JesusChrist #peace #faith #hope #anxiety #fear #keepmovingforward

I am remembering this constantly, lately. It's hard sometimes, but what peace (the peace of Christ) I have within by remembering. Thank You, Lord! üôå #peace #Jesus #remember #need #hope ‚Ä¢ #Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "It is fitting that a child ask his father for relief in trouble. And it is fitting that a loving Father give his child only what is best. And that he always does: sometimes healing now, sometimes not. But always, always what is best for us.‚†Ä ‚†Ä But if sometimes it is best for us not to be healed now, how shall we know what to pray? How shall we know when to stop asking for healing and only ask for grace to trust his goodness? Paul had faced this problem in his own experience. You recall from 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 that Paul, not unlike Job, was given a thorn in the flesh  which he called a 'messenger of Satan.' We don‚Äôt know what sort of pain or malady it was, but he says that he prayed three times for its removal. But then God gave him the assurance that though he would not heal him, yet his grace would be sufficient and his power would be manifest not in healing but in the faithful service of Paul through suffering.‚†Ä ‚†Ä In our text at Romans 8:26, 27 Paul addresses the same problem, I think: While we are waiting for the redemption of our bodies,‚†Ä ‚†Ä 'The Spirit helps us in our weaknesses; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he (God) who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.'‚†Ä ‚†Ä Sometimes all we can do is cry out for help because we do not know in what form the help should come. The Spirit of God takes our stumbling, uncertain expressions of need and brings them before God in a form that accords with God‚Äôs intentions. And God responds graciously and meets our needs. Not always as we at first hoped, but always for our good.‚†Ä ‚†Ä So let us not be proud and stand aloof from God stoically bearing what fate has brought. Rather let us run to our Father in prayer and plead for help in time of need. That is my fifth affirmation."

Lamentations 3:40, "Let us test, and examine, our ways, and return to the LORD." #identity #knowyourself #temetnosce #Christ #Jesus #truth ‚Ä¢ #Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "God delights when truth reigns in our inmost being (Psalm 51:6). And Jesus said, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me' (John 14:6). It is Jesus ‚Äî not our disordered and broken psyches, desires, bodies, and pasts ‚Äî that determines who we are and how we should live. He is the truth and the way. We cannot really be true to ourselves until our selves derive their identity, purpose, and destiny from the Father through Jesus.‚†Ä ‚†Ä Being honest to God is openly admitting who we really are and no longer living out of the fear of man. But it is more than that. It is repenting of the pride that has fueled our deceptive ways of living, whatever that might mean.

And it is embracing his truth, however difficult and painful that embrace might feel at first.‚†Ä ‚†Ä What God is after in this truly honest surrender is to give us the greatest joy possible: himself. He wants to align our inner beings and our outer beings with his being. And this alignment only happens when we lay aside our foolish pride and humble ourselves under his mighty hand (1 Peter 5:6), for he knows how and when to exalt us in ways that will blow our minds and increase our joy ‚Äî in him."‚†Ä ‚†Ä Read more at desiringGod.org.

Feeling a little worn so far today. Woke to feeling like I hadn't slept at all. This world has been pressing hard on myself, and our whole family, the last 6 months; and the pressure seems to be increasing at times. But to be honest, it's really the same pressure...my flesh just growing weary under it. And it's the very thing reminding me, as I give it all to Jesus every morning - and throughout the day as well - that God doesn't allow His children to endure pressures of this world without a purpose. His purpose in mind. The enemy and his ways, have been given authority by God (read the first handful of verses in Job). The enemy needs the basic permission to cause issues. But see to the enemy, that equates in his mind that he can destroy us. Yet, as God tells Satan in Job...he can't destroy Job. But Satan still attempted to. And though Job whined and complained, and his own wife encouraged Job to turn from God in all the afflictions he endured, he never forsaked God. He remained faithful, even in complaining. ‚Ä¢ God disciplines those He loves to bring about something better to glorify Him, and to bring good to us through that glorification. Everything...everything we go through carries an opportunity of purpose. His purpose being fulfilled. All the hurt, suffering, and pain we go through carries a purpose. That purpose? For God to be God in our lives, and nothing else. ‚Ä¢ Nothing can replace God in our lives and fulfill joy within. Nothing. Anything that seeks to replace Him, or actually does, leaves a remaining void that aches deep. And when that ache only God can fill and soothe is refused, things and other people (e.g. addictions - including simple unhealthy behaviors like controlling others and every circumstance in life) take His place and wear our lives down. ‚Ä¢ Take heart, my brothers and sisters in Christ. Remember John 3:16, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." He loved us, and still does. And in that love, pain to our flesh will occur. But his love brings great comfort and peace...and we will be whole, complete in Christ. For our joy comes from Christ. (James 1:2-4).

The day has finally arrived. The day when I'd leave Apple and meander my way back to the land of PC's and Android devices. I never thought this would happen. I honestly love the products. The straw that broke the camel's back? The direction this company has been going the last year has finally affected the customer service to the point I had my fill the other day.

You cannot afford to be too busy to pray. A prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian. Jesus Christ spent many hours in prayer. Sometimes He spent the night on a mountaintop in solitary communion with God the Father. If He felt that He had to pray, how much more do we need to pray!‚Äù ‚Ä¢ #prayer #pray #christianity #christian #believer #believe #faith #God #Jesus #ministry #itsnotaboutyou #itsnotaboutme #itsnotallaboutyou #ItsAllAboutJesus #billygraham #quote #encouragment

I love watching my husband pour into our son. When it comes to math, I have sincere limits. Yes, I took all the way to pre-calc in college, but in order to pass every higher math class from algebra onward (and do so with B‚Äôs), I needed tutoring daily. Math doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. My husband? It‚Äôs completely natural, and he patiently works through each challenge our son has with it. This is what homeschooling is - it‚Äôs teamwork. Between the two of us, and a great co-op and supplemental classes and many field trips, I love the enrichment he‚Äôs getting early on in life. I‚Äôm eager to start taking road trip field trips very soon. We are all ready. üòÅ #homeschooling #homeschool #fatherandson #fatherandsontime #family #ittakesavillage

Just posted this on our family profile: @familyreconstruction... <‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-‚Äî-//‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-<< This is one of the main reasons we made our own table - for moments like this. Our small, square table that fit well in an apartment years ago - and the size of a family of 3 with a small child - was perfect then. But as our son has grown, he needs more space for his study time - and I do as well to be there with him (available for any questions he has). ‚Ä¢ The other main reason for this table (other than saving us literally around $500) is so we can now host others in our home more comfortably. ‚Ä¢ Hospitality is rooted in the service of others. That starts with our service to God, and then it‚Äôs extended to Service toward our immediate family, and spreads outwardly from there to others. It‚Äôs an act of the heart being shared with others, and being fully available to one another in fellowship and guidance. ‚Ä¢ We are so thankful for the way God provided the resources to help provide this table so we can exercise hospitality with one another (the three of us) and extending that toward others. ‚Ä¢ #diy #woodworking #hospitality #serving #servingothers #family #familygoals #familyproject #homeschooling #teamwork #kitchentable #fellowship #table #farmhousestyle #farmhousetable

Some encouragement for today: quit trying to keep up with the Joneses. ‚Ä¢ How does this encouragement relate to a Moleskine (which costs $7 per notebook, or $14 for a pack of 3 of these basic journals, or even more for thicker ones with soft or hardbacks - upward to $20+), and a basic notebook that cost $1.99? This is how: trying to keep up with my favorite authors who tout Moleskine as the amazingness of all amazing when it comes to journals. ‚Ä¢ This Moleskine is almost full of scripture I‚Äôve been writing out since November last year. I had it on hand, and used it. I purchased the pack of Moleskines I did last year because I always wanted some because some of my favorite authors swear by them being the best journals. And while the paper quality is good, here‚Äôs the thing. They‚Äôre honestly no better than a simple $1.99 small composition notebook. ‚Ä¢ All I need is a notebook to be able to write out scripture in to continue in this new practice of life (habit) I‚Äôve been consistently engaging in daily for a handful of months now. I don‚Äôt need to use the products my favorite authors use. Trying to keep up with their recommendations about products, will drain my finances dry as I seek to keep up with them. I can use their encouragements (for writing, etc) in other ways that don‚Äôt cause me to compromise my finances or my mind with trying to keep up with other people and what they have. ‚Ä¢ Comparison is the thief of joy, and I will enjoy finishing filling up this Moleskine with His Word - but I will enjoy it just as much filling this small composition book up with His Word as well. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt give into the comparison traps of this world, my friends. Trying to keep up with favorite people of ours, and seeking to have things just like them, rob us of the joy we have in Jesus. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúFor am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.‚Äù Galatians 1:10 ‚Ä¢ #comparison #thief #joy #God #Jesus #Christian #Christians #scripture #scripturewriting #Bible #journal #journaling #encouragment #dontcompareyourself #bebrave #becourageous #livebrave #brave #keepingupwiththejoneses #frugal

I was delayed by 2 hours to get my quiet space in. I asked for prayer from trusted friends. I prayed. I got to work. I am encouraged as a result. ‚Ä¢ Encouragement for my brethren in the Lord today: don‚Äôt let sin have its way in you today. It seeks to separate you from the Lord, and the enemy and his demons love to pull at the strings on that sin that Jesus cut from who you are in Him. Fight the good fight. Pray on His armor (Eph 6), tell perfectionism and fear and anxiety who your Lord is, ask for prayer (go to healthy, trusted accountability), pray yourself, and get to work! In turn, this tells the sin of perfectionism, fear and anxiety exactly who God is - and exactly who has the power in you! Be brave. Live brave.

I feel so abundantly proud of my son. He‚Äôs been working hard to earn his achievements - all the boys in the troop have. But as this boy‚Äôs mama, I am privy to bragging rights on this boy specifically. üòÅ He‚Äôs been growing not only at Trail Life, and outings with his troop, but he‚Äôs starting to implement the lessons he‚Äôs learning there in other areas of his life - including his home life. I am grateful to the Lord we found this organization and this troop. Between the mission through @traillife and the and implementation of that mission through the troop leadership we have (from the older boy leaders to the adult leaders), my son‚Äôs life is being impacted in a very positive way. The smile upon his face is truly contained here, for deep within, he‚Äôs exploding with such a deep sense of excitement for his growth and advancements forward. I love watching him grow, discovering more of who he is in the Lord, and connecting with healthy men and young men that encourage him to grow to be his best, and aim to do his best in all he does. We (my husband and I) truly love this organization for our son and family, and this troop. #proudmama #family #traillife #traillifeusa #advancement #courtofhonor #growth #discipleship #leadership #character #boys #momofboys

I was raised and conditioned with this mindset. My mother made sure from the moment I was born for me to know ‚Äúnever let a man walk on you.‚Äù ‚ÄúBe strong.‚Äù She herself was a victim of abuse, and this is where her mindset developed. In turn, the abuse I endured from her - and the neglect from my father - further drove the mindset in me to ‚Äúbe strong.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone - man or woman - take advantage of me.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Sadly, this is not just a feministic perspective, but an anti-trust one above all. To not trust anyone - even God. That I was the only one I could trust, even though the abuse I endured from my mother was that she was the only one I could trust. Narcissistic abuse messes with the mind in a myriad of ways, and this was one of them - a ping pong affect in my own head over who has the power in my life. Me...or my mother? ‚Ä¢ Thankfully at 26, God intervened and called me to Him, and I accepted Jesus. Since then, it‚Äôs been an uphill climb for my mind to be re-framed with a healthy perspective over who has control over my life. And the amazing thing? It‚Äôs neither me nor my mother - or anyone else. Only God, in Christ, is in control of all of life - which includes my life! Which means, my strength comes from Him, because as a human - I am dismally weak. ‚Ä¢ The words here conjure raw human emotion that cries from women at the top of their proverbial lungs, ‚ÄúYes! We are power! Hear us roar!‚Äù But the truth is, we are nothing without Jesus. ‚Ä¢ In the light of how celebration of women occurred yesterday (and has been unfolding for years now), it‚Äôs plainly idolatry. It‚Äôs not so much celebrating being a woman that‚Äôs idolatrous, but the motive behind many people‚Äôs celebration is what makes it idolatrous. ‚Ä¢ Ladies, we‚Äôre not any less NOR any more than men. In God‚Äôs eyes, we are all equal. Equally depraved. Equally desperate in need of a Savior. ‚Ä¢ I hope & pray, as a mama of a boy who will one day be a man, that his future wife is a Faithfully Strong Woman in the Lord, not a strong woman. I pray her parents right now are raising her to not be strong in her own strength, or upon their strength, but that she's strong in Christ. (Cont in comments...)

Our church worshipped to a favorite of @billygraham‚Äôs this past Sunday. And what an impacting message that followed rooted in 1 Samuel 17 about David and Goliath, reminding us all to ask ourselves, in examination and testing (as we are instructed to do in Lamentations 3:40), ‚Äúwhat is our measure?‚Äù Better yet, who is our measure? ‚Ä¢ As believers, we must examine this question deeply within each and every one of ourselves so we can each remember that 1) this life is finite (it has an ending) and 2) there is only one who our lives can be measured against (and it‚Äôs not ourselves, from what we‚Äôve done or are doing, or even what we aspire to do...and it‚Äôs not even against others). Our lives, when measured by human standards, become vain and bitter. But when our lives are measured by God‚Äôs standards, the conviction that comes isn‚Äôt there to condemn as humans (even ourselves do). Instead, the conviction that comes is there to bring us to repentance to God so we can live in His good, right and holy way, in Jesus, even as we are still sinners as humans. ‚Ä¢ Conviction brings a multitude of feelings to the surface which feel so shaming, but remember to bring all of those to the Lord in prayer. For He is our Lord...our Father...and our friend, and will walk through every moment with us. ‚Ä¢ Remember, brethren, let Christ be your courage. Your measure. ‚Ä¢ #bebrave #livebrave #bravery #brave #courage #livecourageously #courage #dontgiveup #keepmovingforward #hymn #hymns

Enough photos have been captured to share about the impact God had through His faithful servant, @billygraham. I took no photos, I took no video. It was a time of mourning for my son and I as we visited @thebglibrary to say ‚ÄúGoodbye, until we meet again.‚Äù I never met Billy, but in Christ, we are connected - we all are (believers in Christ). The Lord used this man in a might way to reach my heart, to keep it focused on Jesus, when I first started my walk with Jesus. In turn, the Lord also used this servant‚Äôs heart to reach our son‚Äôs heart - and to encourage him to seek Jesus in all he does. My son‚Äôs desire is to be a ‚Äúworld changer‚Äù, and because of the ministry the Lord gave Billy Graham to steward, my son‚Äôs heart has been encouraged to pursue such a goal. We are so blessed and fortunate to have a place so nearby to go to (@thebglibrary) to continually find this encouragement for our family‚Äôs lives. Billy‚Äôs legacy of faithfulness to God lives on in us all - myself, my husband and our son. (üì∑‚Äôs by @bgea and @franklin_graham) ‚Ä¢ And the last pic here is from @yourenneagramcoach. The human personality type I have for this life is a Type 6. I share this in this collaboration of photos for this moment because the peace I do have, is truly coming from the rest I have in God‚Äôs Word through this moment of grieving.

I had set this to brew earlier, but I walked downstairs to an empty - unmade pot of coffee. Low and behold, while I pre-ground and measured the coffee last night, I didn‚Äôt fill it with water. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÜ Yep! One of those moments. üòÜ I had a choice in this moment: get angry while beating myself up for such a mindless moment, or start to laugh because I had a human moment. I bet God had a chuckle last night when I set it all up...and just a moment ago, had one again. Yes, though I am His child - I have human moments. ‚Ä¢ Be encouraged today, friends: it‚Äôs okay to have human moments. Your physical life is human. But remember who you are because of Whose you are. And here‚Äôs a hint: you‚Äôre not your humanity. üòâ

I learned today that this was Billy Graham‚Äôs favorite hymn. Next to ‚ÄúJust as I am‚Äù, I am finding encouragement to keep moving forward with the Lord. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhat a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear. And what a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carry, Everything to God in prayer. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness. Take it to the Lord in prayer.‚Äù

Brothers and Sisters, in Christ, this is my hope for us all: That we all remember this earth, this time, and everything within it - it‚Äôs all temporary. We‚Äôre all travelers. All sojourners. This life - as we consciously, and cognitively, know it - wasn‚Äôt created to be permanent for us. Let us remember that even in our sadness, joy remains - for Jesus is Lord, and He is coming soon for all of us who abide in Him! ‚Ä¢ My prayer for us all today, and for the many days, weeks, months and years - for however long is left on this earth for any of us - is this: that we adopt a likemindedness that emulates Billy‚Äôs statement. In doing such, there won‚Äôt be time to marvel, mourn, be embittered by or be afraid of anything in this world for long. Feelings, thoughts, ideals, opinions, protests and support, are fickle based upon humanity. The Lord‚Äôs love, in His grace and mercy in Christ, endures forever. ‚Ä¢ May we never forget who we are because of Whose we are. May we remember our time is finite here, and that time with Jesus is infinite. Grieve. Feel the loss. Feel the ache. Shed tears. But remember, joy comes in the morning! Move through the grief with Him, and keep moving forward - dear sojourner! ‚Ä¢ In experiencing another‚Äôs death, we all have lessons we can learn. May this lesson be, for us all, never lose hope in Christ. He is returning soon for us - His bride! üíô

I am feeling very sad this morning. God has used this man in a mighty way in so many people‚Äôs lives - including my own. The sadness I feel is a normal part of human life. But I must admit, I am rejoicing that I know exactly where this man is - with our Father. I look forward to the day, one day, when the Lord says it‚Äôs my time, to join him. Until then, I will take every encouraging word he spoke, based and rooted in God‚Äôs Word, and run with it - sharing the love of Jesus for His creation so they have the opportunity to choose to become His children. In turn, encouraging those in the Lord to keep on encouraging one another in the faith. This loss doesn‚Äôt mean the end for any of us, but an opportunity to take Billy‚Äôs legacy in Christ and keep moving forward with it. I trust he wouldn‚Äôt want us staying in grieving long, but to keep moving forward remembering God is in charge. Jesus is Lord. And He‚Äôs coming back soon! Let us mourn...let us weep...but let us then rejoice and not give up in good doing, to bring glory to God, brothers and sisters in the faith. We still have work to do! #BillyGraham #ministry #God #Jesus #grief #grieving #loss #keepmovingforward #dontquit #dontgiveup #bebrave #onlythebeginning

Listened to some @skitguys tonight, and in what we watched @celebraterecovery_central, @skitguyeddie stated this: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhen you do the possible, God is going to do the impossible in your life.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ This is exactly what my 9 year coin, hallmarking this moment in time when I started a journey with God, signifies; trusting Him to be with me through every hurt, habit and hang-up I came to recognize and process through as I gave them all to Him. And even 9 years later, I still do. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNow to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout generations, forever and ever, Amen.‚Äù Ephesians 3:20-21 ‚Ä¢ What is impossible within the insanity of our human, sin-natured lives, is fully possible with God according to his glory in Christ. (Luke 18:27) ‚Ä¢ He has completed an amazing work through all the garbage I have been handed (and even created some myself) in this life in Christ. Upon accepting Jesus into my life at 26 years old in late 2003, I never knew even then what a relationship with God looked like. I took every unhealthy, law-based rule I was conditioned with through Jewish teachings, along with the abuse and neglect from my parents, and brought it right into my walk with Jesus. And by His grace, He met me in my darkest moments of depression years ago after our son was born. And He‚Äôs been with me since - using every pain felt as another fire to refine me in Him. It was through step 4 I finally came to understand, know and step into relationship with God. I was 30 years old. And I still go through furnace moments, as He continues refining me through every pain felt that I feel at times. ‚Ä¢ Through the steps and principles found @celebraterecoveryofficial, I‚Äôve learned how to walk with Jesus, and stay in connection with Him. It‚Äôs not easy. Sometimes, it‚Äôs downright painful. But truly, it‚Äôs worthwhile. ‚Ä¢ Praise God, for all He‚Äôs done to bring me to this moment to celebrate all He‚Äôs done...is doing...and will continue to do, in Jesus‚Äôs mighty name! Thank You, Father! üôåüèºüéâ

Utilizing one of the printables I found on @magnolia‚Äôs website, I created this to slow down...and to wish you all a very Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt buy into the commercialism and the fantasy that this world has built around it. Embrace the love that God the Father has for you. Remember He loves you with an unrelenting love, mercy, grace and compassion in Jesus. God Himself came to this world so we could have connection...relationship...with Him. (John 3:16) Without Jesus, God‚Äôs judgment will destroy us. But He saved this world from that destruction because He loves us - His greatest creation. ‚Ä¢ Today may be a painful reminder of love lost in this world. It may remind also of love that‚Äôs gone sour, or it‚Äôs been tarnished. It may also remind of the ones we no longer have in our lives due to physical death or relational death. Take heart, be encouraged: allow yourselves to feel said pain from any of that sourness or loss. Allow yourselves to grieve. And in turn, allow yourselves to embrace the love from your Heavenly Father in Christ. And if your faith in Jesus has been tarnished due to the abuses others have done to you - remember, their pains are the ones that misused God‚Äôs Word and ways to harm you because they refused to take responsibility for their own lives with God. You no longer need remain a victim. God is God; not how anyone uses or misuses His ways or word. ‚Ä¢ He loves you, otherwise you would not be here. Come...come to His feet and allow yourselves to be loved by Him in Christ. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCount it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.‚Äù James 1:2-4

Our world is a reflection of this fast-paced way of our humanity. But like an artist who‚Äôs intentional to share a story, a message, that‚Äôs worthwhile...that‚Äôs significant for the human heart...that encourages it to live life instead of exist in making it to the finish line first...God‚Äôs ways in this world are slow. They‚Äôre intentional. (At least they appear to be, for all that‚Äôs in this world is a slow unfolding of what‚Äôs already been done. Let that sink in.) ‚Ä¢ Think about it: there‚Äôs  a reason so many of us are fascinated by stop-motion and slow-motion animation and videography. It shows us the details of life we miss so easily in the blink of an eye because it‚Äôs so fast. And this is exactly what God is calling us to do daily: slow down enough, even for a few moments, to see - to capture in our minds, so He can dwell within our hearts and do His healing, graceful work - the details our minds so easily overlook when we seek to be productive in life rather than living it. ‚Ä¢ To-do‚Äôs. Checklists. Emails. Social Media. TV. Movie theaters. Fast food. Microwaves. Dishwashers. Cars (especially ones that drive themselves). All of it...it‚Äôs all cool. It‚Äôs all wonderful. It‚Äôs all able to be partaken of in moments to enjoy the fun that can be experienced in this world so we enjoy the life He‚Äôs given us to live now on this earth. But in excess, it wears our minds and hearts thin. ‚Ä¢ Life was created to be intentional. To notice the details along the way so we can be productive for Him. To bring glory to Him - not to ourselves. Sin nature...our humanity...seeks to cloud this. Ambiguity, grey, murky, lukewarm...it all muddies the clear, calm, peaceful and grace-filled waters residing in Jesus. ‚Ä¢ Today, be encouraged: slow down. Put down your phones for a few moments. Turn off the computer. Quit checking your email and social media 20-50 times a day. Pick up your bible and read it (not on a device). Highlight in it. Write notes in it. Journal - by hand. Read a book. Color with colored pencils. Draw. Make a batch of cookies or a cake. Make those Valentine‚Äôs Day candies. Do something slower. Cont... #rest #peace #art #artist

Absolutely true. ‚Ä¢ I used to say in @celebraterecoveryofficial open share times, ‚ÄúHi. My name is Marni, and I‚Äôm codependent.‚Äù What I learned was to instead of saying, ‚ÄúI am codependent‚Äù, to say, ‚ÄúI am a grateful believer in Jesus Christ who struggles with codependency.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ We must be so very careful of misusing the two words, ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù Whatever we say after those two words, then tells our minds our identity. ‚Ä¢ God is the great ‚ÄúI Am.‚Äù And as we are created in His likeness, and redeemed in His Son, we must always speak of who we truly are in terms that glorify His character. For as His children, in Christ, we are no longer slaves to our flesh - to sin - but free in Christ Jesus. Therefore, our identities are directly connected to God‚Äôs character; not our humanity (our flesh). And codependent behavior is a human response to pain we experience in our lives that we struggle to cope well with, and/or abusive treatment from others. Addictions, anxiety, depression, etc...as all human behaviors. Not of God. Therefore, we are NOT our human behaviors, thoughts, ideas, feelings, etc. We are ONLY who God made us to be, redeemed as His children in Christ. ‚Ä¢ Christian brothers & sisters, be careful of what you say of yourselves after, ‚ÄúI am‚Äù statements. It really does matter. #identity #labels #label #IAm #God #Jesus #JesusChrist #BeCareful #BeCarefulOfYourWords #recovery #codependency #codependent #abuse #depression #anxiety #ChristianLiving ‚Ä¢ #Repost @wholemagazine „Éª„Éª„Éª THE NECESSITY FOR LABELS

As an LU Alumnus, as is my husband, for the record - just because we matriculated academically from LU, doesn‚Äôt mean we automatically agree with what the president of our alma mater believes and states politically. He‚Äôs human (just as is our President), and our faith doesn‚Äôt rest upon any human. Only God, in Christ Jesus, by calling and guidance of the Holy Spirit.

As if the two depend on one another. ‚Ä¢ When we mix up politics and theology, we end up going down some dangerous roads, as my alma mater's president did last week.

Such a huge amount of truth reside in these words. And I was privy to experience this truth in a mighty way yesterday as I found myself in a debate online in a public forum - and it wasn‚Äôt negative at all. This was a huge milestone for me to experience, because over the course of the last 20 years or so since I‚Äôve been online, my experience has been very much the opposite concerning discussions where there are opposing views. Therefore, I‚Äôve distanced from such dialogue - especially online - for awhile now. But what I learned yesterday in discussion with quite a few women - including a prominent bible study teacher - is that debate is merely a discussion between people with opposing viewpoints on the same topic. It doesn‚Äôt need a huge amount of emotion, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be negative. I learned that when we merely state the information we have to share, and do so respectfully toward others, it actually works out when the other parties involved are healthy enough to converse the differing information they have to share - and seek to find some common ground together so all parties involved somehow benefit in a healthy way. ‚Ä¢ Yesterday‚Äôs experience showed me that this quote holds significant truth and value - for Jesus debated. He confronted. He let others know the truth of God, of Himself, even though it was (and still is) a severely unpopular standpoint. Yet, He listened to others - and answered them with the truth (and did answer their questions, even though they may not see it answered their questions). ‚Ä¢ Debate (confrontation) isn‚Äôt trying to get someone on your side. It‚Äôs about discussing through the issues by stating whatever information we have to share, and seeking the truth through it all. It is messy, but that‚Äôs because human sin makes it messy. Pride mucks up so much more than our feeble human minds can fathom - until we are confronted with truth, and debate through it in healthy, respectful, God-glorifying ways. ‚Ä¢ I hope this encourages many of you today as I have been re-encouraged. Healthy debate can happen online - but use discernment (God‚Äôs guided wisdom) of whether to engage or not; and then how if you do.

This is exactly why I struggle to sing contemporary worship songs in corporate settings anymore. It‚Äôs difficult for my mind to separate between an encouraging Christian song and a true worship song. I‚Äôve been finding it much better for me, in my time of worship privately and corporately, to worship with hymns. Perhaps the Holy Spirit is working on my heart right now concerning worship by music. Whatever the situation is, I value many contemporary Christian artists with their music (encouraging and worship), but so many take these songs and create something within church settings that reflect more of the world (a concert) rather than God working in and through everyone in those moments. ‚Ä¢ From all this, the encouragement is to just take time to examine what worship truly means to you and The Church - and why it‚Äôs so important as a faith walking believer in Christ. It definitely needs to be thought about. #worship #worshipmusic #church #God #Jesus #theheartofworship ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @awtozeramanofgod „Éª„Éª„Éª #tozer #awtozerquotes #awtozerquotes

It took a long while for this post to come about. It finally did; but the conversation about it is far from over. I will have more follow-up posts for this one in the coming year. ‚Ä¢ Death. Loss. Grieving. It comes in many faces, but they all must be dealt with the same: the process of grieving. ‚Ä¢ I wasn‚Äôt conditioned to handle loss (of anything or anyone) this way. However, God is teaching me a new (but not so new) way. He‚Äôs teaching me His way. And while His way hurts my flesh, my humanity, I trust Him. I trust His ways. I trust His process.

It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve had established quiet time, and lately I‚Äôve been fighting for it. Some days, it just hasn‚Äôt happened - but I refuse to give into perfectionism‚Äôs voice and quit. I get back up off the ground every time life knocks me down, and I keep moving forward. . . . . Don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt let perfection win. Don‚Äôt let the anxiety, fear, and sadness have its way. Don‚Äôt let the enemy smile with joy, and giggle with pleasure as he mockingly snickers to God, ‚ÄúSee, they don‚Äôt love you. I got them just where I want them.‚Äù . . . . Fight the good fight...this one life God has gifted. This one life that we all get to breathe for a certain amount of time to capture a glimmer of His glory until it is time to rest fully with Him. Breathe in His Word - first thing; replacing anxiety with hope, and fear with faith. In turn, breathe out His ways the rest of the day as you walk with Jesus. #anxiety #depression #quiettime #candle #lightacandle #hearthandhand #bible #devotional #scripturewriting #journaling #God #Jesus #hope #faith #fear #sadness #sad #dontgiveup #dontquit #getbackup #keepmovingforward #bebrave #livebravely #brave #life #courage #perfection #perfectionism #nomoreperfectmoms

I‚Äôve always had major issues with the clich√©, ‚ÄúGod will never give you more than you can handle.‚Äù The reality is, He will allow things to happen (and even, at times, give you things that you can‚Äôt handle) so you lean more in Him rather than yourself. . . . . #Repost @ajesuslife „Éª„Éª„Éª Think about a time when God came in and gave you strength to handle something impossible.

Good word on #shame ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "Let me illustrate from Scripture two kinds of shame. The Bible makes very clear that there is a shame we ought to have and a shame we ought not to have. I‚Äôm going to call the one kind, 'misplaced shame' and the other kind 'well-placed shame.'‚†Ä ‚†Ä Misplaced shame (the kind we ought not to have) is the shame you feel when there is no good reason to feel it. Biblically, that means the thing you feel ashamed of is not dishonoring to God; or that it is dishonoring to God, but you didn‚Äôt have a hand in it. In other words, misplaced shame is shame for something that‚Äôs good ‚Äî something that doesn‚Äôt dishonor God. Or it‚Äôs shame for something bad but which you didn‚Äôt have any sinful hand in. That‚Äôs the kind of shame we ought not have.‚†Ä ‚†Ä Well-placed shame (the kind you ought to have) is the shame you feel when there is good reason to feel it. Biblically, that means we feel ashamed of something because our involvement in it was dishonoring to God. We ought to feel shame when we have a hand in bringing dishonor upon God by our attitudes or actions.‚†Ä ‚†Ä I want to be sure you see how important God is in this distinction between misplaced shame and well-placed shame. Whether we have a hand in honoring God or dishonoring God makes all the difference. If we want to battle shame at the root, we have to know how it relates to God. And we do need to battle shame at the root ‚Äî all shame. Because both misplaced shame and well-placed shame can cripple us if we don‚Äôt know how to deal with them at the root."‚†Ä ‚†Ä Read more at desiringGod.org.

Amen. #perfect #perfectionism ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @conformingtothetruth „Éª„Éª„Éª Are you a perfectionist? Follow the link at the end of the post for 5 Bible Verses to memorize that will help you defeat the enemy of perfectionism! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Our perfectionism will never be perfect enough! After my pride settled down, I began to see that I was a perfectionist. However, I really did not understand why it was all that bad? Before I move on I need to let you know, I am sure, no I know, God is still tearing down the lie of the enemy which I bought into. There are places in my heart that are still deaf to the destruction perfectionism can bring. But in this I am confident, and I hold tightly to it daily, ‚ÄúHe who began a good work in me will carry it on to completion.‚Äù Philippians 1:6. What is Perfectionism anyway? Webster's definition of perfectionism: a disposition to regard anything short of perfection as unacceptable; especially, the setting of unrealistically demanding goals accompanied by a disposition to regard failure to achieve them as unacceptable and a sign of personal worthlessness. Let that definition sink in for a minute. The gift that keeps on giving, worthlessness. If your mind is poisoned by the idea that you must be perfect in all you do, you will fail every single time. All failure does is confirm what your mind already believes, I am worthless! This is a never-ending no winning cycle. Your perfectionism says everything must be perfect. But the problem is nothing is ever perfect enough for the perfectionist. If you are a perfectionist know this, it is a cycle of defeat! I heard this on the radio several years ago and it helped me understand my thoughts very well, " The world will out world you every time." This saying covers everything from perfectionism to insecurity. All of which have pride as their center. Sister, there is only One Who is perfect, that is the Lord Jesus Christ. On His perfection, we must build our lives. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Copy this link: http://bit.ly/2mn3grp  to finish this article on my blog and find 5 Bible Verses that will help you defeat the enemy of perfectionism! #jesus #truth #christian

I have a goal to finish 50 books this year. Since taking a significant break from Facebook, I‚Äôve noticed a reigniting of a desire to read books - not articles. I devised a plan: read out of one book per day. I‚Äôm halfway through the first two on the top, the rest I haven‚Äôt yet cracked the binding. ‚Ä¢ So starting today, I‚Äôll be reading the top book (Butterfield), then tomorrow I‚Äôll read the next book (@jonacuff)...and so on and so on. ‚Ä¢ This is for during the day reading - for to read anything non-fiction at night, before bed, reels my head and I can‚Äôt sleep. So I have some good fiction books stacked up to read throughout this year before bedtime. ‚Ä¢ I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall posted on my progress throughout the year. ‚Ä¢ #reading #books #readbook #dailyreading #writersread #goals #2018goal #finishbook #arnoldreadsbooks

Wrote a new blog post. An article from @desiringgod this AM inspired it concerning anxiety (you‚Äôll find the link to the article in the blog post). I pray and hope this encouragement (which I needed to see written out before me as well) reaches those who need it most today. Anxiety seeks to isolate because it seeks the comforts of this world. But God has the remedy, and I‚Äôve been slack in taking healthy doses of it daily. Time to change that around.

Time for a fresh start...even if quiet time is delayed a few days and a few hours. Perfectionism is screaming out at me saying, ‚ÄúWell, you already messed up the beginning of the year! Why even bother starting now?‚Äù To which I respond boldly to it, ‚ÄúBecause you, perfection, have no hold on me.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Perfection wants to keep any of us from moving forward. It prompts feelings of defeat even before the battle has started, and encourages us to doubt. If it is given a chance to succeed by us choosing to let it have power, we will remain stuck and grow complacent. ‚Ä¢ This is my way to fight perfectionism and tell it just how much power it has over me. I am about 4.5 hours overdue from doing this activity this AM, and about 3 days late in even starting this month. But the best way to fight perfectionism? Do something toward a goal that defeats the words it encourages you to do, such as, ‚ÄúGive up.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ I refuse to give up. I refuse to let it have me, or power over me. I choose Jesus. I choose His life in mine. ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs time for me to water my mind, my heart and my soul with His word. ‚Ä¢ Encouragement for y‚Äôall: don‚Äôt let perfectionism win. Don‚Äôt let its whispers stop you in your tracks. Even if today is a baby step forward, take it! And tomorrow, take two! And grow from there. Perfectionism hates progress, and even small steps forward is progress. In Christ, you can beat perfectionism because Christ is perfect even in our weaknesses. Hallelujah! ‚Ä¢ Love y‚Äôall! #nomoreperfectionism #perfectionism #anxiety #quiettime #scripturewriting #HeidiStJohn #heidistjohnscripturewriting #encouragment #hope #dontgiveup #keepmovingforward #dontquit #BeBrave #LiveBrave #recovery

Exactly. Always read in context. Read the whole chapter, not just the passage. Read the historical background of the time that this was written in. Who was speaking it. To the people that were spoken to. Etc. Etc. It takes time. It takes study. It takes discipline. ‚Ä¢ Rushed interpretation always brings more harm than good. Processed interpretation honors life. ‚Ä¢ Many Christians believe science isn‚Äôt a part of the Christian faith - or has no relevance in it. How far from the truth and reality this really is. Earning a science degree in Religion, I learned otherwise. Science - the process of exploring and assessing something - has a huge part to play in studying scripture. Don‚Äôt denounce science just because many have used it against God and His Word. Instead, learn about the processes science teaches - and see how science honors God when used well and wisely to glorify Him. In turn, we all benefit. ‚Ä¢ #apologetics #discipline #study #GodsWord #bible #God #Jesus #disciple #doctrine #theology #interpretation #scientificprocess #science ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @drfrankturek „Éª„Éª„Éª It's all about context.

A lot of truth is woven in these words. We must remember though, God‚Äôs word isn‚Äôt dry. It‚Äôs alive, because He is life. It‚Äôs truth; therefore His love, grace, mercy, compassion and fire (through the Holy Spirit) will deliver it so others can be brought to life. Charisma definitely has its place in sharing The Gospel through biblical doctrine; though I firmly believe (as these words reveal) it‚Äôs not to be entertaining. God‚Äôs word is alive to be life transforming. #bible #God #Jesus #doctrine #grace #charisma #TheGospel #discipling ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ #Repost @anarrowmindedwoman „Éª„Éª„Éª ‚ÄúDoctrinal preaching certainly bores the hypocrites; but it is only doctrinal preaching that will save Christ‚Äôs sheep.

#Repost @desiringgod „Éª„Éª„Éª "I want you to fix in your mind what it is that threatens your tranquility most, what it is that causes despondency or disheartened feelings to rise most often in your own life. What‚Äôs the shell that Satan drops most frequently into your life? And then as I mention these five steps that the Lord Jesus took when the bomb dropped in his life, I want you to translate them immediately into your experience, because they‚Äôre all relevant.‚†Ä ‚†Ä Jesus chose some close friends to be with him. Verse 37: 'And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.' So he didn‚Äôt withdraw. He took the inner ring, his most precious and trusted friends, and he pulled aside with them.‚†Ä ‚†Ä He opened his soul to them. Verse 38: 'Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death."' I can imagine their mouths dropping open, their King confessing his weakness. He opened his soul to them.‚†Ä ‚†Ä He asked for their help in spiritual warfare. 'Remain here and watch with me.' Another text says 'pray,' and another, 'Don‚Äôt let yourself come into temptation; stay here and fight with me. Fight with me.'‚†Ä ‚†Ä He poured out his heart to the Father in prayer. Verse 39: 'My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.' It‚Äôs just fine to pray that the bombshell that has dropped into your life be taken away. That‚Äôs just right. Whatever it is that Satan fires at you, it‚Äôs just fine to say, 'Take it away Father. You‚Äôre stronger than he is.'‚†Ä ‚†Ä But finally, he rested his soul in the sovereign wisdom of God. 'Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.'‚†Ä ‚†Ä So here‚Äôs the lesson. When Satan drops a bombshell on the peace of your life the initial shock waves of emotional response are not necessarily sin. What is sin is not to do what Jesus did when the bomb fell in the Garden of Gethsemane. Sin is yielding to depression. Sin is not taking the armor of God. Sin is not waging spiritual warfare.‚†Ä ‚†Ä But Jesus shows us another way. It‚Äôs not painless, but it‚Äôs not passive either. And I want us to follow him in it."‚†Ä ‚†Ä Read more at desiringGod.org. Link in bio.‚†Ä ‚†Ä https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/battling-the-unbelief-of-despondenc

These statements are all in my very biased (but true üòâ) opinion: ‚Ä¢ He‚Äôs an incredible father. He‚Äôs a great husband. He‚Äôs a fierce friend. He‚Äôs brilliantly intelligent. He‚Äôs ingeniously funny. He‚Äôs crazy silly. He‚Äôs amazingly fun. He‚Äôs wonderfully supportive. He‚Äôs loving beyond measure. ‚Ä¢ Being with this man for the last over 20 years (married for over 18) amazes me. How the Lord was so good to me to allow this man to come into my life, I‚Äôll never be able to full fathom. But it is something I‚Äôll forever be grateful for, for he is such a blessing. ‚Ä¢ Happy birthday, sweetheart. I love you, and am so thankful to the Lord for you. Your life helps make my life sweeter, and I count that a blessing everyday - even when I act all sideways. üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¢ I hope you have a wonderful day! Love you! üòò #awesomearnoldadventures
