Was back at @sideprojectsessions again this morning, working through some ideas for a few big commissioned still-lifes that I‚Äôll be shooting. I was digging through some archives, looking for some old cameras to incorporate into one of the pieces and found this beautiful old Yashica of @websitesarelovely. This was from a photographic getaway with a bunch of creative peeps out at Fall‚Äôs Creek, when we drove up into the mountains in search of snow. ‚òÉÔ∏è

A quick portrait of @chiliphilly this morning at his @melbourne_cm Creative Mornings talk, all about the winter shorts and Adidas. ‚òÉÔ∏è He was one of my #lobohandyseries subjects a few years back (scroll right). It was wonderful to hear all about his craft and where it‚Äôs been taking him since. #cmmelb

Spent another productive morning working my way through my forgotten archives at @sideprojectsessions. This was a surreal moment at J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n glacial lagoon where we were taken out on a zodiac through the glacial icebergs as they slowly drifted out towards the ocean.

Spent a quiet Sunday morning co-working at @extraordinary_routines‚Äò @sideprojectsessions attempting to delve deeper into my ever growing archive of forgotten photos.  This was photographed on the stunning black sand beaches of Vik, Iceland. I had taken a few 13 second exposures, most of which sadly ended up with a bit of camera shake thanks to the relentless, buffeting winds. So I dedicated this morning‚Äôs session to manually correcting the camera shake and have fallen in love with this image (and Iceland) all over again.

‚ÄúSquam Lake‚Äù has been one of my favourite prints, and memories from what was a perfect day out in New Hampshire a few years ago. To make room for a new range of prints, @onefineprint is offering a decent discount on existing framed prints like this one.  Send them a message if you‚Äôre interested or want to see what else is still hanging around! ;)

A few weeks ago, I photographed the wonderful and talented @katepullendraws and her right-hand man Vinny, to capture the seriousness that is her lettering and illustration practice. It‚Äôs serious business. The beautiful paper creations were by @papermondays and while they may look slightly larger than average, the reality is Kate and Vinny just happen to be quite small people. ‚úèÔ∏è

Towards the end of our trip, one of the most memorable hikes was out at Dritvik Cove in West Iceland.  We had been keeping an eye out for the remnants of an old Labyrinth in the area, which we never actually found! Among the ruins of this old fishing station though was this orange hut, standing out amongst the rugged Icelandic landscape as the glacier capped Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull momentarily peaked through the clouds. #Sn√¶fellsnes #Iceland

The conditions for were a bit wild when driving up through Northeastern Iceland. People weren't kidding when they said we'd need to hold on to our doors to keep them from breaking off! Despite this, it was a wonderful drive out to M√Ωvatn and hilarious trying to stand still in the wind and not get blown off of cliffs.

Currently sitting at the airport after an epic road trip around Iceland with @mimobase. Never have I experienced landscapes so diverse in a single trip. From hiking on glaciers to waking through lava fields, I feel like we've been travelling for a year. This was what we saw at Fjalls√°rl√≥n Glacial Lagoon. It was a wet couple of days in this area but made for a stunning landscape. I'll be sharing a few more of my favourite spots from from the trip soon. Couldn't help but snap a few thousand photos! #iceland #Fjalls√°rl√≥n #skaftafell

Seeing the Northern lights has been on my bucket list for quite a while now and was one of the reasons for making this Iceland trip. Felt pretty lucky to have caught them so vividly on our first night on the road. Words and photos really can't describe how majestic and humbling they can be when they take over the sky.

Cheers, and Happy Friday! I‚Äôve been pretty quiet on here lately and it‚Äôs been forever since I shared any of my studio work, let alone commercial work. It‚Äôs been a pretty hectic year for me, working on @Foliolio at the same time!  It was pretty exciting to see this campaign I worked on with @Aer.design finally come alive in such an iconic Melbourne location at @Federationsquare, something I never imagined I would see when I moved here 4 years ago. What I loved most about this shoot though, was that it was such a concise culmination of a few fun little projects I‚Äôve worked on in the studio over the years, mainly: #lobohandyseries #lobograze and #lobospill projects. We worked on producing 4 final artworks, that had the flexibility to fit different print formats, digital promotions, way finding, signage and an animation. You can check out the other works and where they ended up as well as the animations up at the link in my profile. Many thanks to @Aer.design for getting me involved on such a fun project and to @Strayorbit for the excellent retouching work you put in to help me hit our deadline!

Spent 4 days with a few creative mates out at Lake Eildon. Many thanks to our host John for stuffing us all in his troopy, and taking us out on his boat. While his advice to stand on the front while it was moving was a bit questionable, it sure was a lot of fun for @jessicabyphotos. I wish we had gotten two people on there to relive the ‚ÄúKing of the World‚Äù scene from Titanic, pretty much compulsory for all water based excursions, although I‚Äôm sure the boat would have nose dived to reenact the wrong scene.

It‚Äôs the last weekend of One Fine Print‚Äôs ‚ÄúAutumn Showcase‚Äù at 69 Smith St., Fitzroy. This crisp autumn view of the space will be missed by @onefineprint and @anacastudio, no doubt.

We were out for a walk for golden hour, shooting by a foggy Lake Eildon when I jokingly suggested that someone should jump in.

A sneaky snap of @valepiqueg as we walked out to check out Horseshoe Bend in Arizona. When people ask what the highlights of this road trip were, I consider this to be up there. It was these few minutes of stunning light that got me, as we walked quietly to the bend and the sun set over the vast, timeless desert landscape.

We've almost made it to LA, with coastal fog obscuring most of our Big Sur drive. It made for some dramatic photos, but think I may need to be back soon to see it all in full! This is the Bixby Creek Bridge which apparently rarely ever looks like this. üì∑‚úèÔ∏è:@canonaustralia #canonaustralia #5dsr

Woke up early this morning to drive to the Grand Canyon with the #cmtourbus. We made a pit stop along Route 66 in Ash Fork, Arizona, a town of 300. We met an intrigued local, Floyd who we all fell in love with. He showed us his beautiful 1958 Chevy Biscayne, restored for his wife as an anniversary gift. They met in 1958. He played us a few of his favourite jams over the speakers too! (See my story for some bts). A truly awesome way to start the morning. Thanks, Floyd from Ash Fork!

One of the joys that I‚Äôve found with shooting in infrared is not knowing exactly how a shot is going to turn out. What you see is definitely not what you are going to get.  It lends itself to experimentation and is a slow creative process, but soon enough you start to learn and understand what can be done with it. I find this is similar to what I loved about shooting film.  I busted out my most handsomest of cameras and a few of my planty friends to see what I could come up with. (Have a look at my latest story to see what it looked like IRL. That backdrop is actually a dark navy blue!).

Learning a hell of a lot of stuff about what looks good and what doesn't in infrared. It's all subjective though. Generally, portraits can come out interesting but a bit odd/creepy and leafy landscapes are classically beautiful.  I've got some ideas for some still lifes, although experiments so far have been a bit bland.

#FBF to this week 5 years ago, where a group of my favourite photographers road tripped to Marfa, Texas for #phootcamp 2011.  On the way back to San Francisco, we made a stop at White Sands, New Mexico.  I still smile every time I think about that afternoon.  @neilberrett had just jumped over a cardboard cutout of a tiger, then later off the side of a sand dune, @codywbratt was photographing @nuzz wearing a panda head, and for some reason @boltron is just chilling on a bear skin rug.  Rain clouds started to roll in as the sun set and I remember thinking it was possibly the most beautiful place I had ever been.  It was an unforgettable trip, and encapsulated all the fun that got me interested in photography in the first place. Something always worth remembering.  Thanks @LBM! #SFRV

Spent the most wonderful weekend up at Mt. Beauty with 8 other photographers, shooting late into the night, and waking early to chase the morning mist. I decided to try something a bit different and photographed much of it using a full spectrum converted SLR, and capturing everything in infrared.

I popped in to check out the latest @OneFinePrint pop-up store to see some of the new work and see how this print of mine came out.  I love it and want it for myself! If you or anyone you know has been looking to fill their walls with some fresh, new photographic work, tomorrow night is the night to check it all out!  One Fine Print will be keeping it‚Äôs doors open to celebrate the opening of their latest Pop-Up store, a collaboration with @retropiahomewares  I‚Äôve got a few new prints amongst some other amazing photographers‚Äô work, so if you've been wanting some larger printed photographs for your own walls, come and have a look. There will be cheese. Hope to see you there!!! 28th October 6-8pm 70 Lygon Street, Brunswick East #onefineprint #shika #deer

Our road trip out to Lake Eildon was cut short by the need to see some animals at Healesville Sanctuary today.  Feeling the wind off of these birds of prey as they flew overhead was pretty epic. See @mimobase for some adorable baby wombat action.

#tbt kinda. Revisited all the old neighbourhoods that I used to live or hang out in when I lived in Tokyo. Also reenacted a few favourite falls, including hitting my head on a telephone pole while skateboarding, falling down the train station steps into the road, tripping and rolling down the hill in front of my school, and pictured here, falling from the top of the jungle gym through to the bottom, without hitting any of the bars ( I was a tiny 4 year old). I can't believe this death trap was still there! #tokyo #azabu #arisugawa
