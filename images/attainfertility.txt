Let us be clear, this is NOT ok. If you or someone you love has walked away from the dream of having a baby because of the assumption that IVF is not financially possible, it‚Äôs time to turn around and walk right back.

Meet Our Team Who: Sharon Brooks, Attain Fertility Customer Care Representative Hometown: Niles, Illinois (Just north of Chi-Town) Loves Most: My son will always be #1 but zen time on Lake Geneva back home is up there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this for over ten years. My favorite part of my career is when patients send me notes and baby pictures thanking me for my help and encouragement during their treatment. Once, I even had a patient call me their ‚Äúhuman angel‚Äù. Not all patients are emotionally or financially prepared when they find out they need IVF - it truly can be sticker shock! It‚Äôs definitely an emotional hurdle and that‚Äôs what I am here to help with. I really believe that it is a privilege to be on that journey with someone, supporting them.‚Äù Ready to learn more about the Attain IVF program and it‚Äôs benefits?

Artichokes are high-antioxidant veggies. Antioxidants are great at zapping free radicals (unstable uncharged molecules in search of electrons to pair with), which can cause DNA damage to eggs, as well as deteriorate the egg cell membrane and inhibit fertilization.
