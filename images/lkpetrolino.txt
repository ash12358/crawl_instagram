When I first came to @paulrevelia I told him my delts refused to grow. “Ohhh, I’ll get your delts to grow” he said confidently. I have to admit, I was skeptical. Displayed here is exhibit A of why you should never doubt @paulrevelia ! 🎉🎉

When @kennywallach adds a few inches to your lat spread in 30 seconds flat! Had my first posing session today and cannot be more excited about the changes Kenny made in how I present my physique already! Seriously amazing the different shape he created! Pumped to continue our work together to display the best physique possible this season! #kennygainsFTW

Vacation does a body good! Down two pounds since I left last week. (I’m barely 5’2” so two pounds is a lot for my tiny frame in a week). Surprised, but happy to see another new low this am, even after flight last night and an extremely late bedtime (when was the last time I saw 2am? I don’t know and have no interest in seeing it again #grammalifeFTW). Only change in program in the last four weeks has been the addition of one 40 minutes cardio session. Macros haven’t budged. Second photo shows my weight trajectory for this prep. A nice smooth and steady down hill. Always grateful for my body’s cooperation and excited to keep rolling closer to my goals this week! ———————————————————————— Coach: @paulrevelia @teamprophysique

Spending this guy’s birthday in one of my favorite places. And the closest thing to a “home” I have. Happy birthday to my man crush everyday. So lucky to spend beach days, rain days, crazy days (which are most of the days....I mean, this IS me we are talking about), and average days with this one.💕 (Also, peep this killer @ravishsandsswimwear bikini.)

Check-in with @paulrevelia this week and excited to be down another 1.6lbs and fourth of an inch on my waist. I’m just so, so grateful for how easy this prep has gone and the guidance and support of Paul. So freaking excited for this competition season, I can barely stand it. And each week as I watch my freaking amazing @teamprophysique teammates kill it on the stage and in their own journeys, that excitement just grows. Working crazy hard to make my team proud when my time comes!

#MCM and #throwback to these awesome shots @lisarheaphotography took of us back in January. Because in less than two weeks my amazing and talented BFF @lisa.rhea will be back here to take our engagement shots 😍😍. If you live in Maine and want the chance to shoot with her (trust me, you won’t regret it), she’ll have some time on Friday, while I’m working, that I’ll let her escape to play with other people. Link over to her page and check out her amazing work. She’s the most talented photographer I’ve ever worked with (and she’s kind of a cool human too).

Yesterday I walked by a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and felt jealous of the fact it got to sit under that warmer light. While thus far this prep has really been pretty easy for me and my body has cooperated amazingly well, the one area that has been a struggle is how much colder I am vs previous preps. I mean, I’m always cold during prep, and expect it, but this summer is not doing me any favors! It has been much colder than normal and I basically walk around in five layers of fleece all the time. As I write this I’m in my kitchen wearing fleece pants, a fleece top, and my @thenorthface !! Northface is basically the officially sponsor of this prep! Anyway, when I took these check-in photos this morning it was 50 degrees, and you can tell by the look on my face how I feel about that fact! I have so much respect for all you people who prep in the winter! You are true survivors! Please Mother Nature, just make it a little warmer. Please! #prephypothermia

I love to bake for other people, and when I’m cutting I enjoy it even more. You can extrapolate the ironically messed up psychology around that. Regardless, some things I make are fairly healthy, some not so much. This is a pretty healthy and super simple one (but still always gets rave reviews). Plus, everyone needs a good banana bread recipe. It’s a life rule. So, I thought I’d share. Gluten-free Chocolate Chip Banana Bread 🍌 ——————————————- Recipe in comments below 👇🏼👇🏼

I built this! Four years and 15 lbs heavier in the current photos.  #transformationtuesday baby! (In the second photo of my back pose, my new back looks like it ate my old one for a snack.) ———————————————————————Four ago, when I decided I really wanted to pursue this crazy sport called bodybuilding I had pretty much never even seen triple digits on the scale. I was an athlete my entire life, but gnat-sized. It’s a challenging thing to pursue a goal that’s so far off you can hardly even see yourself there. But while I’m not naturally gifted with many skills, the one I do have is obnoxious determination. And it’s basically driven all the success I’ve had in life. Bodybuilding is no different. ———————————————————————Man, I have a long way to go (and that’s what makes this sport fun...there is no end point, only a journey to get better), but I’m proud of my physique today. I built every ounce of it and that’s so empowering its impossible to quantify!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2a2cc89a8fc8a9b730e0562b83dac30d/5BCA0071/t51.2885-15/e35/34808075_1845927345709495_8050409574894665728_n.jpg
Here’s our current situation at 11 weeks out. Prep is a mind game as much as it is a physical one and this was the first week this prep I really just had to get out of my own way and squash my own negative self-talk. I’ve mentioned this before, but one thing I’ve worked really hard on the last couple of years is not just watching what I say to myself, but the TONE I say it in. Have you ever listened to how you talk to yourself sometimes? You wouldn’t use that same tone with an enemy. And it matters. As a type A perfectionist I can be pretty harsh on myself if I’m not careful. Focusing on tone has done wonders to help me be mindful of the messages I project into my own brain. The words you say to yourself are powerful, and so is learning to use them to empower you vs push you down. Ready to spend another week focused on becoming better!

My favorite thing about these photos is....it was leg day! But heeeey shoulder pump, we can be friends every day! So fired up and inspired watching so many of my amazing @teamprophysique teammates compete this weekend, and obviously my delts are too! This is already my best physique and I have twelve weeks to carve it into something I’m really proud of!

Not sure if I ate a lemon before taking this shot or what (what is this face I’m making?), but regardless kind of, sort of starting to get lean enough to see what my shape is going to look like when I’m actually lean. So much more work to do, but pretty darn proud of what I’ve built since my last round

Friends, last night I realized my boobs had finally given up the fight this prep and begun to sacrifice themselves for the cause. Their bravery in the midst of calorie deficit was admirable and held out longer than I expected. Alas, they’ve now become prep POWs and I ask that you send them prayers and strength until I’m able to liberate them come improvement season. Godspeed girls! Godspeed! #flexfriday #teamnoboobs

#whitemountains Wednesday (because I realized I never shared photos from the second half of Memorial Day weekend and I’m in count down for some more trail time this weekend). Boulder loop trail and a fun little hike we stumbled upon by accident and challenged us to figure out how to cross a river five times!

#transformationtuesday - Eight weeks out from my last show two years ago vs 12 weeks out from my first show of the season this year. Five pounds lighter in the photo from two years ago (and my fellow tiny chicks know five pounds makes a big difference on a little frame). Can’t wait to see what my eight weeks out shape looks like this round!

Flat Mcflatterpants, but feeling great! I continue to be blown away (and ridiculously grateful) for how easy this prep has been, how well my body is responding, and @paulrevelia’s  prep magic. Dropped two pounds this week, but honestly I don’t feel like I’m prepping at all. My energy is high and my strength continues to increase. We are 10 weeks in and a little less than half way until my first show of the season (still finalizing show plans). I know this second half won’t be as easy and I have a lot of grinding ahead of me, but I’m just crazy excited to continue to unveil the improved physique I created over my twenty month improvement season. I also feel super lucky to have had coaches along my journey (first with @nicktongstrong and now @paulrevelia) who put my health and metabolism first. Otherwise a prep like this couldn’t happen. I definitely wasn’t dealt a great hand genetically in this sport, but I’ve pulled some aces when it’s come to support and guidance in my journey.

Maybe one of my favorite photos ever! A week ago doing my favorite hike, with my favorite person, wearing my brand new favorite piece of jewelry 💍🤗. So many favorites!

Sooo...this one time, in the White Mountains, I GOT ENGAGED!!!! Friday night we made it to the Whites and decided to go for a night hike. We headed over to Cathedral Ledge in Echo Lake State Park and started exploring. Suddenly, Rob decided that we should start bouldering up these eight to 12-foot cliffs to get to a ledge about 50 feet above the trail we were on. Obviously, never one to shy away from a challenge, I followed along, essentially leaping, grasping for grips in the rock I could hang on to on the top of each mini-ledge, and then muscling my way up. Honestly, this adventure alone was enough to make my evening gleefully awesome. I didn't think it could get any better. But when we finally got to his goal ledge....well, he kind of made it better. The bottom photo is the view from our "engagement ledge." If you look past my hand in the photo of the ring you can sort of see our path to get there. If you know us at all you know this engagement is perfectly us. And crazy symbolic of the lives of endless random, and often ridiculous, adventure we'll have together. <3

Oh White Mountains I fall more in love with you every time we are together. Today we summited Mount Chocorua, did the Champney Falls loop, and then played around in Diana’s Baths (waterfall and natural pool) trails. I’m so grateful to live is such a freaking amazing part of the world, have the physical ability to see every part of it, and a pretty darn handsome adventure partner to share it with.

Two years ago I had the privilege of hiking Mount Katahdin with the Summit Project in honor of Army Cpl. Andrew Hutchins. It was such a special hike and an honor to be part of a Memorial Day celebration which really spoke to the day and why it exists. This year we will be hiking independently in the White Mountains, but the intent will be the same. If you have a friend or family member lost while serving our country please comment below (or DM me) and I’d be honored to carry a stone to place at the summit in their honor. While a terribly small gesture in context of the sacrifice our service members and their families make, remembrance of that sacrifice is such an important part of our democracy and our responsibility as citizens who benefit from it. Thank you to all who serve and all who have lost someone who has fought to keep safe the rights we often take for granted.

Weekly check-in (and dog booty cameo). No change in weight this week, but my waist definitely tightened up quite a bit. Even more exciting, swipe —-> to see comparisons from same day last year, at the EXACT same weight. Body recomp wins!!!

When I talk to new people about the sport of bodybuilding one of the first questions I get is if it bothers me to not be able to live a “normal” life. Anyone that knows me knows that “normalcy” is not really one of my priorities. So the answer is, very clearly, “no.” ———————————————————————— But seriously, what is “normal?” If I wasted my time trying to define myself by some obtuse definition of normal I’d never see, little less pursue, the things that bring me joy. A quest for normalcy is a quest for mediocrity. Also something which isn’t of interest to me. Being normal and being extraordinary ARE mutually exclusive. In definition and in practice. ——————————————————————-When you follow your own path you WILL make choices other people don’t understand. And that’s ok. Some of the best decisions I’ve ever made were ones everyone around me questioned....as were some is the worst. But they were all mine, and that’s what matters. You’ll never find your true north if you use someone else’s compass. ———————————————————————— Photo courtesy of my favorite part of every Sunday: Admiring myself in the mirror after my weekly check-in photos.

White Mountains Wednesday! I’m making that a thing, because just a weeks and a half until we make our first trip of the season to one of our favorite places. And the weather is solid enough for my wimpy soul to start hiking locally every weekend now too (the true New Englanders are rolling their eyes at me right now,and my May through November only hiking season.) Happy place celebration. These pictures are from two of my favorite #whitemountains trips. First is at Franconia Ridge (although I almost died later in that hike in an ice/wind storm and blew right off the mountain) and second at Crawford Notch.

No, that’s not the lighting....I’m really that white. There isn’t even a filter strong enough to fix that. But my delts actually look like they exist. So you win some, you lose some.

Three years of progress for this little posterior chain of mine. Widen the lats. Close the thigh gap. Plump the shoulders and glutes. Creep, creep, creeping my way to bigger and better. (About 15lbs difference between the oldest and the current picture) #transformationtuesday

I always drop on Sunday. If I don’t have a low weight on Sunday I won’t drop all week. My body is often pretty predictable (albeit, crazy) and a Sunday drop seems to just be what it likes. Luckily the prep gods were in my corner this week and I hit a new low this morning. Even more exciting, my waist is down an inch since the start of prep. My wide waist is a constant weak point for me, so I’m always grateful to see it tighten up. Happy with where I am and pumped for another week to inch closer to my goals.

Climbing into the weekend like..... I’m a super good rope climber (thanks gymnastics). It’s a pretty easy skill for me. So one of my goals now that I have a gym that has a rope I can practice on, is to climb only using my arms. Today was my first day to try it and I got about halfway up. I’m going to be a pro at it by the end of prep (and use my decreased body weight to help 🤩). Just putting it here because I believe in naming goals publicly. Operation Upperbody Rope Climb: Commence! #badassmode

Over the last several months my feed has been super full of people blaming bodybuilding and physique sports for creating a poor relationship with food, causing body image issues and obsessions, forcing them to isolate friends and family, and making them abandon the things they love. ———————————————————————— And while bodybuilding is by no means a sport for everyone, it’s important to distinguish between what an external force “does” to you vs. how you respond to an external source. These are different things and until you recognize them as different things you’ll always be a victim in your life. ———————————————————————— You need to be responsible for your input and chose your output, in all aspects of life. So by contrast, here is what bodybuilding has helped me do (same sport, different response): **It forced me to face obstacles I had placed in my own path and blamed on my inability to reach my goals. **It taught me just how strong, both physically and mentally I am and empowered me to have more faith in that strength. **It reminded me how crucially important and beautiful struggle is. How empowering it is to embrace it, breath it, and then come out the other side with the knowledge you can do really freaking hard things. **It’s taught me patience. A lot of patience. But along with that the value and beauty of setting a goal that starts so far away you can’t even really see it and then slowly inching towards it month by month, week by week, day by day. **It’s introduced some amazing people in my life i never would have known before. Many of you are reading this post right now. ———————————————————————— I’ve been an athlete my entire life, and every sport I’ve participated in has shaped my life in someway. But the real moral of this post is to always remember that life isn’t happening to you, you’re responding to it. And there are two sides to every coin. The ability to chose where we focus and how we direct that focus is ours alone. Something might not be right for you, it might not bring out the best in you, and that’s ok….let it go. But acknowledge it’s not the thing, it’s you and your response to the thing that makes the difference.

This sport is a long-game, and so sometimes it’s hard to appreciate just what you can do in a year. This is especially true when that year is part of a 20 month off-season, so you have no show to gauge progress by. You just put your head down and work, maximize your input on all variables, and have faith in yourself, your coach, and your persistence. That’s why comparisons like this are so fun. One year. Right around the same weight. A lot of faith. (Back pose —-> front pose) #transformationtuesday

Three hundred and sixty five days ago (a year for those of you not good with math) I moved in with this guy. You learn a lot when you live with someone and this is what I’ve learned: he makes me laugh every day (even when I’m angry at him and don’t want to), overthinks everything (truly EVERYTHING), will leave something in the fridge until it’s growing arms (and then still think it might be still good), and frequently thinks he’s Drake (which is a rough identity crisis for a really white engineer). He also has convinced my furry children to love him more than they love me (see second photo), so now I guess I’m stuck with him. So #mcm to this dude for successfully living with my “only child” quirks for a year and (for the most part) learning to put the dishes IN the dishwasher vs on the counter on top of it. 😂😳 ——————————————— 📷: @lisarheaphotography

Back on home turf. Feeling like I’ve been run over by a truck after a looooong day of air travel. So I did what any self-respecting bodybuilder would do: made my bun extra high, my music extra gangsta, my locker room selfie extra obnoxious, and my leg workout extra miserable.

Headed back to Portland after a week working from Knoxville (so I could play with my parents in the evenings) and couldn’t leave without giving a shoutout to my Knoxville gym home (and by far the best gym and community in Knoxville) @e_x_fitness ! Every time I come here @wademadephysiques had made this place even better. Constantly upgrading and bringing in new equipment. And it’s the best gym atmosphere you’ll find almost anywhere. I’m always sad to leave this crew! See you all in the summer!

Me at five. Me about a month ago. While some people change a lot over the course of their lives, I often tell people I’m EXACTLY the same human I was as a toddler, just taller. Case in point.

I just want to give another appreciatory shoutout to my body for being so dang cooperative (so far) this prep. This has been the easiest prep or cut I’ve had (muchas gracias to the genius of @paulrevelia for that.) Down another pound today, which I wasn’t expecting due to a long day of air travel combined and a killer migraine yesterday! And can definitely see some tightening up this week and loss in my “valleys” vs my “peaks.” (As I heard @cwteamwilson say and is such a great explanation). I know I’ll hit stalls, but I’m happy to ride this momentum as long as we can.

Way too legit! #2legit #2legit2quit Also, shout out to my fellow children of the 90s who still know the moves to this dance (and the modified hand only version). For those of you who weren’t alive yet to dance to this, and other classics like “Jump, Jump,” I’m sorry.

Four weeks into prep, four pounds down. And of course, per usual, my quads are the first to lean out. Small stall last week #becausehormones, but hit a new low this morning and rolling this train along. Food still really high. Cardio low. Holding on to the momentum as long as we can. Thanks for cooperating with me body! You’re swell!

After @brookie27stylist does my hair I like to take a bunch of different selfies so I can bring them back on days when my hair is absolutely out of control and refusing to be conquered. Today is one of those days. It makes me feel like I have my life together! So here’s a photo from a few weeks ago when my hair was calm (as Rob calls it) and I look like an adult who has control over the fortress in her head.

Finishing up week two of prep. Two pounds down and food only a tad lower than peak of this last gaining phase (actually at a more comfortable level for me). PR-ed pretty much every lift this week, so my body is definitely in a happy place. A lot of fat to lose, but in this week’s checkin photos I start to see what my shredded down shape will look like!

Caught this accidental screenshot of me walking back to my camera from a video of some posing practice this morning. A) Not mad about it B) Looks like I found my new favorite flexing spot in the gym.

Since I’m obsessed with my backside this week, here are two fun #transformationtuesday shots. The first one almost exactly four years (and about 35lbs ago 😳) and only a few months after I decided I wanted to compete. The second is about three and a half years and 20 lbs ago, but I had to included it because I’m constantly amazed as to how it was possible to even walk on those stick legs!

First week of prep down! I’m so freaking excited about the amount of width I’ve added to my back. Can’t wait to excavate and see what all has been built! I added rabbits to make this an Easter post! Hope every one had a great one. And remember rabbits don’t lay eggs. Not even decorated pastel ones.

Happy Birthday to one of my very favorite humans. My hero, mentor, teacher, therapist, and friend (oh, and father too), Joe Petrolino. When I was home over Christmas this year, I found a letter I had written him for his 50th (when I was 10). I thanked him for putting up with me and asked for a car (a red Firebird) and a horse. The wonderful irony of parenthood is all those traits that drive him crazy — my stubbornness, brattiness, and ferociously independent spirit — come directly from him (and my lovely, but equally stubborn and independent mother). But so do my drive, persistence, and relentless pursuit of my goals. I'm very much his mini-me in big ways and small, good ways and bad. He's is, after all, the original #PetroPower It's no secret to anyone who knows me, I idolize my father and feel so lucky to have grown up watching him. his success, and the many ways (large and small) he's changed the world. Not a day goes by in my life I don't think about how he would handle a situation and try to emulate. Even Rob has started doing a "WWJD" (What Would Joe Do) check-in on choices. Happy birthday to my first, and forever, superhero. Once again, thanks for putting up with me.

I’m just a simple girl with simple dreams. Like lats so big I have to walk through doors sideways and a waist so small you have to zoom in to see it!

It’s snowing again and I’m over it this year. So here is a #tbt of two really bad pictures, but at least we were warm. The first we tried to take of ourselves and I was sinking into quick sand (ok, I’m sure it wasn’t really quick sand, but I was sinking) and almost push Rob over trying to save myself. But my glutes look great, right? (#becausesquats)The second a nice man tried to take of us, but I got a case of the giggles and couldn’t stop laughing. Oh well.

I posted this on my IG stories last week, but I thought it would be a good idea to have a more permanent memory of the day I realized my head was obviously shrinking. Luckily, as @decillis and @dietrichgini know, I have an oversized head. So there is some wiggle room when it comes to shrinkage (that’s what she says - pretty much never edition). Plus I totally nailed my audition for Kenny on South Park (OMG! They killed Kenny....so he needs an understudy). Happy Monday!

The good news about the fact we just got four new feet of snow is that a) it’s gorgeous and b) it gives me a good excuse to share these #flashbackfriday photos of this fun snow day shoot with @lisarheaphotography. So thanks Maine for allowing me to share snow-laced photos halfway through March, and still be relevant!

#tbt to fully appreciating my off-season glute and quad game while in Grand Cayman (and stealing the boyfriend’s @bodybuildingcom shirt to cover snorkel-time induced pink shoulders #youdneverknowiwasitalian #whitegirlxgazillions)
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6990aac3c19397c8a5b390c7ffed4b4d/5BEA2AEB/t51.2885-15/e35/29093139_190296481747661_507250914856271872_n.jpg
One of the last things we did in Grand Cayman was visit the famous @caymanturtlecentre. This is the only thing I remember about Grand Cayman when I came as a kid. And my obsession with sea turtles has only gotten stronger. I’ve been lucky enough to watch a momma turtle lay eggs on the beach twice and it’s such an amazing experience. Make sure you watch the last video with sound on. We talk about how “sexy” the turtle shell is and then she splashed us! Little minx! Also, fun fact: Male turtles have the largest male part of any species (in proportion to their body size!). So sexy shells matter in the turtle world!

Made it back to Portland last night after a crazy amazing trip full of stingray kissing, cave exploring, beach walking, turtle playing, and even a brief visit to hell (photos from this last two coming soon). Thanks Grand Cayman for being awesome!

Today we explored the Cayman Crystal Caves, which were absolutely fascinating. This is my Disney World!

I kissed a stingray and I liked it! Puckering up to kiss this hotty on our awesome snorkeling trip with @captainmarvins today! This was an amazing experience. They were everywhere swimming around us and we were able to feed them, play with them, kiss them! (Swipe to see some less intimate PDA photos of us hanging with the rays too.)

When bodybuilders travel. Because it obviously takes a village to keep me functioning. My chiropractor says I’m like a Formula One race car 🏎- high performance, but need my tires changed every ten laps. That’s about right.

Just sent @paulrevelia what will probably be my last check-in of our improvement phase. This finishes up a 20-month improvement season. I’m a ridiculously, ferociously competitive human and when I decide on a goal I go after it, relentlessly. That’s why after my last show I decided I didn’t want to get back on stage until I felt like I could hold my own. This is a long game for me and I’m driven by the process and pursuit, not just the bling and sparkle (although I adore that too). So here’s our starting point! Let’s see what’s been built! (And yes, I do have my sports bra on inside out (peep the tag). Big goals don’t have time to put their clothing on properly....or something. 😳🙄)
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f3fa9732ff277d1573968e04612430fe/5BD92789/t51.2885-15/e35/28430260_2075498642719954_7352455828558839808_n.jpg
I came downstairs from catching up on some work and all three of my boys were lounging on the sofa. In desperate need of a mental break I decided to selfie bomb them. Calamity ensued (and me dodging Oliver’s X-Men like tongue).

Ending improvement season with clear appreciation for my gains! (I wish I could say I posed for this shot, but sadly, it’s a screenshot at the end of a video I was trying to take of my shoulders. I was so amazed at my own awesomeness I don’t even remember doing this! So my admiration of myself is really organic! 😂🙄 #becausehumble )

As I finish up the last few days of this improvement season, I decided to look back at my physique from this week across the last four years. I’m so proud of this transformation. (Front pose —-> Back pose.) Bigger, stronger, leaner. I have a long way to go, and that’s what makes it crazy fun! These next four years I’ll spend each day as I did the last - pushing to improve just a tiny bit each day (in every way, my physique change represents for me a visual symbol of that drive across all aspects of my life). My pride in how far I’ve come fuels my drive for how far I’ll go.

Charm bombs and shoulders pumps, these are the things Wednesdays are made of! Also was so excited about both I cut off like half my head in the shot. But who needs hair when you’ve got charm? Right?! (Thanks to @dietrichgini for supplying me an amazing assortment of tank tops with one-liners that define me, this one makes Rob roll his eyes, which makes it one of my favorites.)

On Tuesday we selfie. For no other reason than the fact my hair is still relatively straight (thanks @brookie27stylist ) and straight hair really makes me feel like I have my life together! Like straight-haired Laura would be the type of person who would always wear matching socks and never lose her keys in the refrigerator.

Fun afternoon with my crazy crew watching the slowest moving and highest scoring hockey game I’ve ever seen. @philadelphiaflyers and @nhlbruins alumni game at @cross_arena was a blast from the past (including some star players and both the Bruin and the Flyers coaches).

#flashbackfriday to my first (and only) nude photo shoot! Not many people know I was a toddler pin-up model (I keep it quiet because I don’t want people to be intimidated by my impressive past.) But this shot was actually on the cover of Toddler Playboy. ****************************************************** Please don’t treat me differently now that you know. I’m just a girl....with a rubbery ducky, in a tub of bubbles and baby shampoo.

There’s a quote that floats around IG a lot, “you can be a masterpiece and a work-in-progress at the same time.” And that’s something I always try to remind myself. Sure my lats should be wider, my waist smaller, my shoulders rounder, my quads bigger....But then photos like this pop-up (thank you @timehop) and I’m reminded five years ago I had no shoulders, my lats were no where to be found (how did I even lift my arms up?), and I was an odd shade of orange and looked like a deer about to be run over 😳😂. (Also peep the improvement in my scoliosis in the second photo!!)———————————————————————— Bodybuilding is a physical and visual representation of your power to change! You can accomplish so much, in every aspect of your life, in five years. And knowing that daily, consistent input can basically change your trajectory is incredibly powerful. I’ve mentioned before that I set five year goals for myself, because it’s enough time to do major things. You can accomplish a ton in a year, move mountains in five, and change the world in ten. It’s crazy empowering to know that all you have to do is decide how!

Heading into the week pretending to be as graceful and poised as @lisarheaphotography makes me look in this photo. When in reality I’ve already had to change shirts because I completely missed my mouth when taking a sip of water and then proceeded to walk into a door I forgot I closed behind me. #klutzlife

Two weeks left in what will be a 20 month improvement season! Someone asked me the other day which I liked more: Prep or improvement season? And honestly I love them both equally. ————————————— The process of it all is really where the fun is in this sport. Both have their highlights and struggles and are both empowering and challenging in their own right. And both help me learn more and more about my body, which it turn fuels success in the next stage. ———————————————————————— Bodybuilding is a long-game sport. And I think it takes awhile to really appreciate the fact THAT is what makes it so fulfilling and ridiculously addicting. (At least I know it did for me.) But once you do, it’s an amazing place to be! ———————————————————————— Plus, I’ve found in a world that’s totally McDonaldized and focused on “fast,” “easy,” and “immediate” results, there is so much value in learning to commit yourself to something which requires time, patience, and a consistent, steady, intrinsic drive. ———————————————————————— The last 20 months have been awesome and I’m proud of what I’ve put in each and every day to move me closer to my goals. And now, I’m ready to shred!

This is an uncharacteristically sentimental post, but @_lisa_rae_ sent this photo to me last night and it made me feel all mushy. With all the ridiculously amazing photos @lisarheaphotography took of us last weekend, this one is no where near one of the best and by far less than picture perfect. But it might be my favorite. ———————————————————————— As picturesque as Lisa’s mad skillz made us look in these shots from the Old Orchard Beach Pier (don’t worry, I’ll be spamming you all with MANY more), the conditions were horrible. It was freezing rain, the wind was furious, and it was COLD. Needless to say we weren’t in the most waterproof or warm clothing and we were freezing. My huge pile of hair was going all over the place (Rob is literally using his arm to keep it tamed down here), Rob was full of snot, and by this point I had no feeling in my limbs and my jeans kept falling down. But we honestly still had so much fun! And you can see that here. ———————————————————————— In the end relationships are hard. They aren’t perfect and they don’t always play out like a romantic comedy (although some times they do, especially the “comedy” part). Life doesn’t always run the course you envisioned it, nor is it supposed to, and that’s ok, that’s what makes it fun. In the end if you can say to someone, “I choose you because you make me happy, even through the roughest storm,” then you have all you need. ———————————————————————— I choose this guy every day because he makes me laugh like I am in this photo, even when he’s dripping snot on me and I’m on the edge of hypothermia. And seeing that here makes me so happy, and grateful. Thanks for capturing that Lisa 💗.

Added ax throwing to my line-up of skills this weekend. And by “added” I mean I am excellent at throwing axes at things, not so good at actually aiming the blade correctly. So I might not chop someone’s head off, but I’ll definitely knock them out (or at least give them a really nasty bruise). Basically I’m going to have to choose another weapon to use during the zombie apocalypse! @_lisa_rae_ ,on the other hand, was basically born to throw axes and Rob is pretty good too. So maybe they can just throw the axes while I dance around to “Thriller,” and distract the zombies 🧟‍♂️. That’s much more aligned with my natural skills. _________________________________ (I also can’t seem to make a mean face (see second photo). I end up looking like I ate a lemon or am one of those trolls whose hair you rub for good luck 😳🤪)

After a birthday week full of adventures and notes from the people I love and an absolutely amazing weekend with one of my best friends and these two crazy dudes (plus George the cat), it’s hard to even imagine how I got so lucky to have a life made up of such ridiculously awesome people. For me, life will always be about the people I spend it with. And I scored the freaking jackpot. (Another awesome photo from a chunk of gold in my jackpot, the crazy talented @_lisa_rae_ of @lisarheaphotography )

Life tip: Find ridiculously talented people and make them your friends so they can make you look fabulous. As you’ll see, I basically just made @_lisa_rae_ my friend so she could be my personal photographer. We had such a blast shooting yesterday. Here’s one of my favorites! Head over to her page @lisarheaphotography and see some of the other shots we took. And if you’re in the Portland, Maine, Hampton Roads, Virginia, or Nashville, Tennessee area book her so you can look this fabulous too!

My birthday was yesterday. And this series of failed attempts to get a birthday selfies with Oliver pretty much sums up my crazy, hilarious, accident-prone, random adventure-filled, often ridiculous, and amazing life! ***************************************************** Thanks to everyone who makes me feel so special (yesterday and everyday).

Off day today, so I’m spending the morning as any self-respecting bodybuilder would, posing in my bathroom mirror. About four more weeks until @paulrevelia and I start to strip away and see what’s been built. This moose and I are crazy excited!

@whitney_danhauer of @whit_and_whimsy texted me last week and told me when she drew this unicorn she felt like she was drawing my spirit animal.

The magical and addictive thing about Maine is it will give you a few weeks of less than ideal winter weather (as it has this month), and right about the time you start to fall out of love it slaps you with a perfect day like today and you remember you live in the most amazing and beautiful place. And all is forgotten. I love you Maine, I’m sorry we ever fought! 💗💗💗 (and no filters on any of these, because Maine never needs a filter)

#tbt Because pink snowsuits never go out of style! Also of note: Once @kwpetrolino stopped dressing me, I lost my ability to match 😳

Back to my regularly scheduled programming! Whenever I feel an unusual amount of stress in my back while working legs, I know it means I’m not properly activating my glutes. In order to combat that I’ll try to add my @mbslingshot band into as many exercises as possible. It forces that glute activation. Here’s an example: these goblet squats are at the end of my toughest leg day, which means I often struggle with glute activation because I’m fatigued. Adding the band transforms this exercise for me (and protects my back). So if you struggle to activate your glutes in an exercise, try adding a band for a few sets and see how it changes it for you. And please enjoy my struggle face in the forward facing video!

Because recomping is my favorite. ***Side (swipe)—>Front poses*** One year difference, but same exact weight! I’ve been through two cut/grow cycles since then and am on my third growth phase. Man, the human body is fun, right?

According to this Google Arts and Culture app, I’m a descent of Napoleon (I even tried several angles, but I’m undeniably a Bonaparte).

I constantly debate what I'm more grateful for — to have @kwpetrolino as my mother or as one of my very best friends. She's the kindest, most amazingly empathetic person I've ever met. While at the same time being strong, independent, and absolutely unsinkable. People are naturally drawn to her because, in a world that so often doesn't care, she does. She spends her life taking care of others and making them feel special and supported. Not because she feels like she needs to, but just because that's who she is. Helping others is her default. So much of who I am as a person, I owe to my beautiful mother (and thank goodness for that, since I inherited all my stubborn brattiness from My father 😳😂). So please help me make her feel as special on this day, as she makes everyone else feel every day. Everyone, please wish my ridiculously fantastic mother a very happy birthday!

Current shape and ringing in my one month anniversary working with @paulrevelia and @teamprophysique. Could not be more pumped to have Paul at command central for Operation 2018! We have a couple of more months of growing ahead of us and then will strip off the layers and see what’s been built since my last show. By the time I hit the stage again it will have been about two years since I last pranced around in a sparkly bikini. ************************************************** After my last show I decided I didn’t want to hit the stage again until I knew I could be competitive. And that’s exactly what I did. In the five years I’ve been focused on this sport I’ve spent the majority of my time growing. And while I love being on stage as much as anyone, I also love improvement season and the different, but equal demands of that time period. When you spend the majority of your time away from the stage -and even with no concrete timeline of when you’ll be back- you learn if you love the sport or you love the glamour. And when you really love the sport, every part of the process just fuels your obsession. The struggle becomes part of your infatuation with it, not just something you “get through.” ***************************************************** So the moral of this monologue is this: While it’s tempting to want to jump from show to show and chase that adrenaline and “glitter” high; long, focused improvement seasons don’t just improve your physique, they strengthen your intrinsic motivation to excel in this sport. When you are truly driven by a love of the process and not just the destination everything just becomes that much more fun (and if it’s not fun, what’s the point, right?).

A few months ago I found out I had rather major scoliosis. I didn’t have it as a child, but our hypothesis is it developed when I was so sick with #celiac and wasted away to around 50 pounds. I basically had no muscle to keep my spine aligned and the inflammation in my colon didn’t help. I’ve known for years I had it, because I could see it (although most people don’t notice), but until I got x-rays this year, I had no idea how serious it was. What’s really remarkable is if you look at my shoulders, hips, and pelvis, they are completely aligned. My body has found its own balance and that’s why neither I or my chiropractor had any idea how serious it was. Honestly, I hate this imperfection about myself and it’s something my type A, perfectionist-self has really struggled with. But it also makes me in awe of my body and it’s amazing ability to adapt and move forward. Likewise, it makes me grateful for the fact I’ve spent my life in one sport or another and found weights and lifting as a way to build my system back up after being so ill. When it comes down to it, if it wasn’t for the muscle I’ve built to give structure my spinal column and the mobility I’ve developed to fuel all my activities, I’d be in a lot of pain. We often only think of bodybuilding for what it provides us in the gym, but it does so much more to fuel our lives. I’m constantly appreciative of everything it brings to me, through so many facets of my life! So I guess this is a bit of a metaphor about life: to trust the fact you can find your balance, even under less than ideal situations. And mostly a reminder to really be in awe of your body. It’s a freaking amazing structure and can do incredible things when provided the right support. This is a fact bodybuilding had taught me and life continues to reinforce.

Since I’ve been living in fleece-lined leggings lately, I’m proclaiming myself an expert in the category. So in an effort to cement my position as a fleece-lined legging “thought leader,” I’m proclaiming these babies from @90degreebyreflex the BEST fleece-lined leggings on the market. In fact, they are one of the best pairs of leggings I’ve ever worn. Period. Whereas most fleece-lined leggings tend to stretch out of shape with a lot of deep leg movement (deadlift and squatting extravaganzas), these move, adapt, and recover better than most leggings. They form to your shape like they were poured on, and are crazy comfortable and warm. They helped me survive the coldest @patriots game in team history, and for that alone they are MVP! Go buy them! I got mine at @tjmaxx and they are also on @amazon (where l’ll be buying a second pair).

@timehop gave me a fun little throwback today. Back-> Side-> Front pose three years ago vs now. Fifteen pounds heavier now. ( I also was recovering from pneumonia in the first photo so don’t judge my death face). I remember feeling so big in the photo from three years ago, since I had spent the previous year gaining 15 lbs to get to the point I was in that shot. And now I constantly just feel small, because all I want to is grow and improve my physique. Perception, especially your perception of yourself and your relationship with the world, is a crazy powerful thing. The last couple of years I’ve worked really hard to change the tone my inner perfectionist uses to critique myself. Because those same perfectionistic qualities which drive you constantly to be better can also handicap you. So it’s a balance. One I get better at every year, but one I always need to work on. But when I see these two photos I’m proud not only of how my body has transformed, but also the way I’ve redirected my inner perfectionist and allowed myself to lean in to and enjoy every single bit of the process. And be proud of my pursuit of that process. I’m not where I will be, but I’m proud of where I am, and I’ve loved each step along the way.

Fun night last night at the family Christmas party. I don’t get to see these people often, but when I do, it’s always nice to know they are just as crazy as when I left them! Ended the night Daddy/Daughter selfie, of course! Other pictures are of all the grandkids (minus two) and the one great grand kid!

#transformationtuesday which basically is not much of a transformation. I obviously am still ridiculously overly dramatic and still make the same facial expressions. So basically I’m taller and have more hair. The rest is status quo.

Excited to be back at my Knoxville gym, @e_x_fitness ! I love this place and the great people here even more. Such a fun, friendly place to workout. So, here’s a selfie to celebrate.

Waiting to board my next flight so here’s a collection of selfies and mid-set posing from my last couple of workouts. #becausehumble.My anabolic pineapple bun has taken on a leaning tower of Pisa vibe this last week, which can only mean good things. Also, PSA: don’t do legs before flying all day. I make this mistake every time, but never learn. So let my pain help you. Just say no!

First snow day of the year and it was a perfect one! Fresh, powdery snow, sunny skies, temps in the 40s. These are the days that make Maine winters so much fun. I always tell people living here is like living at a ski resort, complete with skiers gliding past your door. Also, I'll never be able to wear that hat again since the snow man clearly wears it better.

What happens when you take two competitive, type A, perfectionists (one who is an engineer and one who is just crazy and has an obsession with things being symmetrical) and send them out for a Christmas tree? It takes a long time and a level of Christmas tree analysis that really should not be possible. But we found one, remarkably for the second year in a row! Ho, ho, ho, our tree is geometrically proportioned and exceptionally spirited. We win!

Two fun little comparisons today. The first photo shows growth: It is exactly three years ago (15 lbs heavier now). The second one shows recomposition: It is from last January at the same weight as I am currently. It was during the first gaining cycle out of my last show. Since then we've done two mini cuts (just finished my last one) and gaining cycles (heading into my second one). These have all been part of my improvement season, which I'm on month 15 of. Slow, steady, consistent....

Completed my annual Gingerbread house making tradition today. And roped these two crazy chicks into the construction zone. We were the only adults actually making houses at Ice It Bakery! (Who made these awesome houses we used as bases). Which tells me more of you adult folks out there need to take your Grinch hat off and get in the holiday spirit! Gingerbread villages need to be constructed and we need your help! I'm not the best house designer, but all of my work is stamped with the #PetroPower seal of approval!

#TBT Evidence my ridiculously over-the-top joy in the presence of goats is not a recent development (see goat yoga posts from several weeks ago). @kwpetrolino told me they literally had to pull me away from goats as a child, when I'd encounter them in farms or at fairs. I've already asked @thisisjessdolce to bring a goat dressed in a tux to my wedding. And she's the kind of friend who will make that happen.

As much as I admire the naked mole rat (see previous post) I'm grateful to have enough hair for it to double as a scarf to keep me warm on this sunny, but chilly Thanksgiving day! And the ability to take selfies to document when I actually do it! (Are you proud of me @brookie27stylist ?!?) Happy Thanksgiving all. Keep gobblin'!

This year I'm grateful for the naked mole rat. It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked and buck toothed, and I really respect that type of boldness. The naked mole rat teaches me to be proud of who I am, even if it's not what the world expects! And to be brave in my decisions and actions, even when they aren't traditional. Thank you naked mole rat, you are a mentor for us all! #grateful #benakedbeyou #moleratforpresident

Tomorrow is the two year anniversary of hanging with this guy (and like 3.5 of friendship). But tonight is the anniversary of when I realized everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) was right: I was being an absolute dumbass by refusing to date him. So, after what was a kind of long and pretty painful pursuit (as he reminds me often), I relented. I figured I’d give it until the New Year (because that was the polite thing to do) and break up with him. But then the New Year came, and I found I didn’t want to. And I was annoyed. Like really angry, because this meant I might have been wrong. I hate being wrong! I swallowed my pride and carried on, and then a year went by, and then I moved in with him, and then I couldn’t imagine my life without him. And now here we are at two years. In many, many ways we are ridiculously different people, and that is absolutely what makes us work. I add a whole bunch of goofball to his path while he provides some stability and logic. He also makes me laugh more than anyone (although he prefers I tell people I like him only because he’s so hot….so shh!). In the end, I was wrong. Which really stinks, but hey, you win some, you lose some…and really I still won. So, cheers to two years of climbing mountains and finding adventure with my favorite person.

Some people are born with nice glutes. Scratch that, some people are born with glutes. Period. Unfortunately, when God created me He was so focused on making the rest of me so awesome, he totally forgot to give me glutes. At all. Definitely a Heavenly #fail, but you know, God, He's got a lot going on. So, let's just forgive and forget, shall we? Luckily, he definitely didn't forget to make me ridiculously stubborn, strong-will, and obnoxiously persistence....thus (along with the support of @nicktongstrong magical programming) my glutes were born. They still have a loooong way to go, but comparisons like this make me optimistic about their future. EXACTLY four years here.

#transformationtuesday front and back pose. One year. Fifteen pounds heavier now. (And how convenient I wore the same thing for my check-in photos).

Last week I had to take Oliver to the ophthalmologist because he had an eye inflection in his right eye. He was given the medication on the left. Today I had to go to the eye doctor with an eye infection in my right eye. I was given THE EXACT SAME medication, on the right. No further comment needed here. 🙄😳

Super excited to be participating with my crazy friend @biggreenpen in the #BridgingtheGap campaign today. One hundred millennials and 100 baby boomers teamed up to create content which looks at our similarities and differences, and the value each generation's perspective brings to our community. Paula and I took an issue top-of-mind for many communications pros: User-generated content, and addressed our different perspectives (follow link in my bio to @spinsucks to see my post). Age is really just a number, and the older I get the more that rings true. There are no rules about when you do what, or what age is "too old," or "too young." Own your own timeline, because despite what the world might tell you, your timing is always just right.

Felt pretty good after my prescribed set of squats today so finished with a few sets of paused squats to work on my power out of the pocket (I get stuck at that transition point and my quads want to take over to pull me out vs engaging my glutes). Then dropped the weight and repped it out to failure. Then went into four sets of 20 sissy squats. Then wondered if I'd walk again. Then realized I had 75 percent of my workout left! 😵😵😵😭

My cardio view > than yours. First day back to any structured cardio in over 14 months (although hiking up as many summits as I can in New England every weekend definitely gets your heart rate up.)

There is almost always more than one way to do an exercise (with proper form, of course). One thing I try to concentrate on a lot is not just doing an exercise right, but doing it right for me. Your biomechanics make you different, which means that it's crucial you don't just perform a movement, but do so with intention on what you are trying to do (another way bodybuilding is a big ole' analogy for life). These single leg RDLs are a good example. I've tweaked them each time I've had them this last year. Each time changing things to get better isolation and connection in my hamstring. Here's what's working really well for me right now. (These shots show top and bottom of@exercise). I keep my non-working leg on the ground, but with zero weight on it and slightly out and behind me. I put a large amount of focus in the stretch of the movement and cue myself to push my butt back as I stretch down. From that stretched position I pull from my hamstrings back. This helps me concentrate movement in my hammies and not my back or quads (which some how even want to take over on these 🙄). I don't go all the way back up at the top, this helps keep my hamstring engaged the entire set. I die a little at the end and hyperventilate 😵🤢

Because doesn't everyone pose in bikini bottoms and a sports bra in the hotel hallway at 6am? Gotta get the right lighting for checkin photos and you can't tell me that bellman wasn't impressed. He's going to ask for this shift every week! About six weeks into a very slow and easy minicut. Only down about three pounds, but that can definitely make a difference on my tiny grams. Waist shaping up a bit this week.

Early post to wish the happiest of birthdays to my crazy, amazing friend and second brain @_lisa_rae_ . While it's painful we live in different states, the world isn't yet ready for our ridiculous levels of 💥💥💥to be concentrated in one place (or huge assortment of absolutely inappropriate jokes). I said in a similar birthday post for her a couple of years ago, "if I'm going to live the thug life, I can't think of anyone  I'd rather be part of my gang...." and that still remains the best way to describe our friendship and how absolutely grateful I am to have this ass kicking, rockstar of a woman as part of my white girl gangsta life!

Well….that was…um, an adventure. Ever since I moved to Maine, I’ve wanted to hike the Franconia Ridge Loop, and yesterday we finally made it. The loop is about nine-ish miles (we did 12, loooong story) and traverses Mount Lafayette, Mount Lincoln, and Little Haystack. The first two are part of the #NE67 and #NH48. It’s the second highest range of peaks in the White Mountains. Because you hike along an open ridge for about two miles while you go from one mountain to the next, the views are awesome, but the weather can be questionable. And we got all the questionable you could get. Once we got to the first summit the wind was extremely strong and we were covered in a cloud. As we continued it just kept getting stronger combined with freezing rain. That was fun. By the mid-point across the ridge I was literally being blown off the path by the wind. My face is bright red from wind burn, my hands are bruised from clinging onto boulders and trees (once we got back under the tree line). It took us about 7.5 hours, which all and all we were happy with considering the conditions and stopping to eat at the Greenleaf Hut (Appalachian Trail network hut) for about 30. We didn’t get to see any of the views which this loop boasts, but we feel like badasses from simply not being blown off the mountain. The adventure and crazY weather made it awesome in a completely different way. Hiking is a lot like bodybuilding in the fact the struggle is really what makes it worthwhile. These pictures show the transition in weather as we summited. The last one shows what the ridge looks like on a clear day vs. what it looked like for us.

#tbt (EDIT: Oops, I forgot it was Wednesday 😳 @biggreenpen ) .... five years of chasing a bigger and thicker back, wider lat spread, bigger legs, stronger glutes, and all the inbetween. All of these were taken this same week. 2016 was two months post show, and I think my best yet. I'm 16 lbs heavier in this 2017 photo. Cutting down a bit now to discover the many ways I've beat that 2016 chick!

Tried to take a picture of a cute little caterpillar 🐛 going across the path. But the sun was just right, I had to snap photos blinded. So, instead I got a collection of photos of me, really excited about a caterpillar. No filter folks. That's pure caterpillar joy you see on my face!

#selfiesaturday because I'm waiting to board my flight to Portland and am bored. Sad to leave my parents. Excited to go back to my boys. When people ask me where "home" is, I can't name a space. I've lived a life across many places and spaces, and each part of it makes up what "home" is to me. The people I love the most are all spread across the country, the places that make me smile or nostalgic don't exist in one area, I have memories that spread across states, countries, continents. I once heard a quote from Japanese poet Matsu Bashu, "every day is a journey and that journey itself is home." That resonated with my experience. The beauty is that home is never a space I'm chained to, but always an experience that's right where I am.

#wcw to this amazing and beautiful woman. My best friend and very favorite mother. So grateful to be able to spend a bit of time with her and her kooky husband this week.

Four years ago, last week, I sent @nicktongstrong my very first check-in photos. Since that time (and between these two photos) I’ve increased my body weight by 48 percent. Which is almost too crazy to absorb. Anyone who has ever lost or gained a lot of weight understands you often don’t realize how much weight you’ve changed, until you do. On top of the fact, before Nick, I had almost never been over 100lbs in my life. I didn’t have weight to lose to begin with. I’ve been a hardgainer since I can remember, athletic in ice skating, gymnastics, and dance growing up, and then in my late teens/early 20s I became very sick and lost a frightening amount of weight. So much they were worried about my heart and internal organs, so I was hospitalized. After spending many months in and out of the hospital over the course of several years, I was finally diagnosed with celiac. Celiac and gluten problems weren’t in vogue at the time, so I had to figure it out on my own….it took a while, and even longer to recover and be able to eat normal(ish) again. I went through a couple of years that I had to puree all of my food and could only eat four or five  items, which I rotated to avoid developing intolerance. Once I was able to live a normal life again I tiptoed around what I ate and basically was afraid of everything. But I was able to maintain an equilibrium where I was well, could be active (I ran competitively, lifted, crossfitted, and had active hobbies (hiking) like I do now), healthy, and happy…so that was enough for me, until it wasn’t. I believe the universe brings you the right people at the right time and that is 100 percent how I feel about Nick. I’m so grateful for him as a coach, friend, and ass kicker. He’s helped me be a better athlete, pursue my goals in bodybuilding, feel and look the best I ever have….but more importantly, he’s helped me be a better human and allow my goals to be stronger than my fears. Life as I know it today wouldn’t exist without his presence in it. Everything in life has a domino effect, and I’m forever grateful the #TongStrong domino tumbled in my direction.

Deadlift rep PR two weeks in a row! 🎉 225x8 and felt much easier than seven did last week. Didn't video so I had to post something, or I didn't happen. Here's a stand-in selfie. Oddly, I'm wearing the exact same outfit as I did for my PR last week. So this much be my lucky PR outfit! Always happy to spend time at my Knoxville gym, @e_x_fitness !

This is one of the first places I fell in love with when I first visited Maine. Since that time I've probably been here a hundred times, during every season and weather condition, and it never stops being absolute enchanting to me.  There are so many moments living here that I have a "is this real life moment." Because the scenery is so overwhelmingly beautiful. Visiting Headlight is always one of them.

Every year since I've moved to Maine, the boyfriend and I take an annual apple picking trip (we started this before we started dating). I've gotten so spoiled by this, I can no longer eat apples if they aren't hand picked, the difference is ridiculous). We choose a different orchard each year and Brackett's is my favorite so far (it's also the oldest orchard in Maine). Eating some apple cinnamon oatmeal as I type this and relishing in today's picks! 🍎 (also, no idea why my hair looks orange in the first picture)

Two years difference (and about 20lbs). Closing out my fourth year of work with @nicktongstrong at the end of this month, maybe in year five I'll learn how to take check-in photos without looking like a deer in headlights. #goals (Probably not, but it's important to aspire to big things.)

#throwback to this spring when I visited the 9/11 Memorial in NYC. The entire thing was stunning, but my favorite part was the Survivor Tree (last picture), the only life that survived the explosions. It's such a beautiful symbol of survival, regrowth, and the tiny sprout of hope that always survives despite all the odds. Often we just have to find it and help it thrive. It's a nice reminder as our country goes through a really rough time: Culturally, socially, politically, and physically. @911remembrance

Tackled Mount Cutler in Hiram, ME today and it was a ton of fun. It also confirmed to me that my dog, is in fact, actually a mountain goat. Terrain was pretty technical and hand over foot for a portion, but he just frolicked around it like he was prancing through a field of daisies. I took the red trail the entire way and it was a blast with a ton of overlooks and ledges along the way.

Two weeks and one virus into mini-cut. Tightening up a tiny bit. And thank goodness I'm cutting, this bastard virus totally killed my appetite and I'm struggling to get it back, even on cut macros. Looking forward to see what progress I can make the next couple of weeks, now that my body is back to operating 100 percent. (No idea what the heck my hair is doing here, it doesn't consult me on style choices)

Accidentally ran over Barbie as I parked at the gym. Maybe if she has some muscle on those stick legs she could have run faster to get out of my way. #quadssavelifes

You know it's fall when the leg warmers come out!

Wishing the happiest of happy to @thisisjessdolce , whose birthday the world celebrates today. Thank you for constantly being my partner in ridiculousness, making me laugh so hard my lungs hurt, and always walking that fine line of sanity with me in a crazy world that only partially understands our brand of misdiagnosed genius! Love ya Stumpchunks! 😂😍

Because Fall sunsets are the best sunsets.

Because keeping me pent up inside when I'm sick is like trying to corral a wild horse (this analogy is not one I made up), so even though I'm coughing up a lung I insisted on finding an easy hike to get outside for a bit. Luckily I have a significant other who understands my kind of crazy (and is a tad scared of me...), so we went. I hacked and wheezed, but had a lovely time. Oliver pretended he was flushing birds out of the woods, but there were no birds and he looked like he needed GPS (slide right for video). And now I'll spend the evening with one of the few things that will actually get me to stay in one place: Football 🏈

Well, that escalated quickly..... Guess I won't be spending the weekend hiking in the White Mountains 😢. (And honestly, it's not as bad as it looks, I just sound like a emphysemic hyena on crack, so they quickly muzzled me after exchanging looks of horror.)

#tbt three years of progress. Swipe ->> for front pose. I was a whopping 98lbs in that first photo, which felt huge to me since it was 14lbs heavier than where I was just a year earlier when I started with @nicktongstrong (up until this time I had barely ever seen triple digits on the scale). I'm 25 pounds heavier today than I was in the picture from three years ago. Which means (for you math nerds out there) we've increased my weight by 48 percent in four years....which sounds crazy, when you think about it 😜 If you had told me four years ago I'd weight what I do now, I would have told you you were crazy. That it wasn't possible for my body. I'm not wrong often 😂, but when I am, I admit it (begrudgingly). This is one of my favorite things ever to have been wrong about!

Caught this #instagramboyfriend last night at the beach. Hard at work trying to get that perfect beach jump shot. Godspeed my friend. Godspeed.

When you become a prisoner at your house thanks to an extremely poorly planned Ironman 😡You give your OCD a prize and scrub the front of the house until it's sparkling clean. They said we would probably be freed from our captivity around 3, so we might try to venture out into the big, bold world soon ! #girlswhoscrubhouses #noscrubs #excepifyoureahouse

When you cut your head off while selfie-ing because some one walks into the locker room. And you want to act cool, but still want to capture a photographic memory of how awesome you are to admire at a later date. #firstworldbodybuilderproblems

Learning about other people's periworkout nutrition has helped me find products and a system that works for me, so I figured I'd share what I've been doing over the last several months that seems to work really well. Digestion and tolerance are always top concerns for me, since I have a *special* 🙄 and sensitive system. So if these things don’t bother me, the chances they will bother you are probably one in 500 million. I workout in the morning and eat one full meal prior to my workout that has around 8g fat/30g protein/80g carb, I eat that about an hour/hour and a half prior to working out. I mix up a baggy (#notdrugs) of @gaspari Glycofuse, @projectadofficial Raging Full (THE BEST INTRA-CARB SOURCE OUT THERE, IMO) and @truenutrition hydrolyzed caseinate and whey protein mix (I've used @truenutrition for over a decade now and really think it's the best protein at the best price out there). Macros of that mix are 20g protein/ 120g carb. On my way to the gym I pour about a fourth of that in my water bottle along with half a serving of Nitro-Ox from @projectadofficial. Once I get there I put half of what’s left of my intra-mix in my bottle along with another half serving of Nitro-Ox. I drink that through my workout. At the end, before I leave the gym I fill up my bottle and put the rest of my intra mix along with a serving of @legionath Recharge. Drink that on my way home and basically until I’m hungry to eat something. Post workout meal then is normally a half an hour to an hour later an includes about 8g fat/30g protein/80-100g carbs (My macros are high obviously, but I try to get in around half my carbs in the peri-workout period). And that’s what I’m doing right now and have been the last couple of months. I’ve also at times used @projectadofficial AminoTaur EAAs and @morphogenben ’s pre-products. All which are awesome, but I’m not using simply because I’ve wanted less flavorful products (probably because my macros are so high), but wouldn’t hesitate to use either again and recommend them often. Annnnd that's all folks!
