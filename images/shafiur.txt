Skipping at dusk. There is a playing field at an elevated level in #Kutupalong #refugee camp. It is always full of activity. Lined on one side with small shops selling fizzy drinks, snacks, ciggies and paan. #rohingya #bangladesh #refugees #myanmar #bnw #blacknwhite #silhouette #blackandwhite #documentary

This refugee kid is waiting for the gates to open so that he can collect his family's allocation of rice for the month. How long can 1.2 million people be kept like this? Dependent on handouts, prevented from education, from gainful employment and rights of movement? it is a hopeless existence. The severest sentence that you can be served - to be consigned to a refugee camp.  Generations are wasting away  in the toxic atmosphere of the refugee camps of south eastern Bangladesh. The UN is moving forward with a Global Compact for refugees which envisages a different and more sustainable approach for refugees and local host populations. Hopefully Bangladesh will rise to the challenge despite the political difficulties and the wicked shenanigans of the Government of Myanmar.  #bangladesh, #refugees #rohingya #refugeecompact #documentary #myanmar #reportage #child

It is difficult to conduct interviews within #Rohingya huts with much privacy. I have always been careful about the presence of children during traumatic recollections. In one interview I thought I had cleared the hut. I asked the interviewee, a widow,  if I could show her a photo of her killed husband to confirm if it was indeed her husband. She immediately said she wanted to see it and  moreover she wanted her young family members to see it too. I said that was not possible.  Suddenly out of nowhere appeared her two teenage daughters, and they insisted on seeing the image. As one daughter was 18, I relented to all the pleading and showed her the picture. What followed was terrible to witness as the young woman became utterly distraught. I left wondering about what I had just done. It was a mistake, and I regret it to this day. #documentary #genocide #witness #myanmar #bangladesh #refugees #ethics #interview #fail #regret #reportage #children #murder

This is Senwara. I met Senwara's daughter in India whilst filming a doc about human trafficking. The daughter has been in detention (euphemistically called "a children's home") for more than 3 years. She can only make it back to her home country of Bangladesh if the authorities can verify that she has a guardian and an address. That is the first step. However, Senwara is now very ill. If something happens to Senwara, then her teenage daughter faces a very bleak life and the possibility of never returning. Please would you read this appeal and share it. And if you are able to, please donate. Link in bio or here https://www.gofundme.com/senwara #trafficking #india #girl #health #trafficked #bnw #blackandwhite #portrait #mother #documentary #reportage

On 2nd September 2017, I received a call from an officer of the European Rohingya Council asking me if I had encountered any orphans in the massive deluge of refugees coming from Myanmar. I had encountered many. Indeed only 10 minutes earlier I had encountered this truckload of survivors from the massacre that took place in Tula Toli, Myanmar. There were a lot of people weeping in that truck - men and women. This lad, Osman, had become an orphan three days earlier when the Myanmar military killed both his parents. He witnessed their killing. Fast forward nine months - I see Osman regularly when I film in the camps. He is a lovely boy but it is clear he has been deeply affected by his experience. He has a difficult life. Even more so because he doesn't know how to read or write. I have set up a funding page for his education. I only need £230 more this year. Please would you consider helping with a small donation? See link in bio. #Rohingya #genocide #myanmar #minaunghlaing #aungsansuukyi #child #orphan #education #poverty

As I finish work on yet another, and as yet unreported,  massacre that took place in the #Rohingya crisis of 2017, I have been wondering if I will ever find anything other than bleakness in all of this. And now there is the threat of imminent repatriation of refugees back to #Myanmar - as if the daily struggles of life in the camps for these survivors is not difficult enough without the fear of return to an unsafe place. But briefly I did find something redemptive. And it was Mumtaz's smile - a survivor from Tula Toli and one of the most photographed victims from that massacre. Journalists across the planet have told her story.  Her health has improved. Her daughter's also. Their head and body wounds have healed.  Of course I am not saying she is over it. Not at all.  It will never be easy to get over the deaths of three of her children, her husband and other relatives. But when i saw her earlier this month, that day for 125ths of a second, she smiled. . . #refugee #refugees #burma #bangladesh #genocide #crimesagainsthumanity #ethniccleansing #women #violence #rape #military

I interviewed #Rohingya activist @nslwin about the possible expulsion of #refugees from #Bangladesh to #Myanmar. This is what he said: The refugees should not be repatriated. Their houses were burnt down. Their land was taken away. And they have no #citizenship. In this repatriation agreement there is no guarantee they will get back their citizenship or be able to go back to their original place. There is no guarantee that they will not be persecuted again. Since 1978, they have been becoming refugees again and again. The cycle of #violence is always going. Both countries should make sure that these people will not be in Bangladesh again as refugees. Their citizenship should also be reinstated before they go back. Nay San Lwin, 1 Dec 2017. . . #reportage #documentary #genocide

Exactly a year ago today I met these young #Rohingya women - some as young as 14. For 6 months I filmed them as they eked out a survival strategy in the unsafe #refugee camps of southern Bangladesh. One girl was trafficked within a month. Now they face danger again: their place of refuge taken away and the real and appalling possibility of expulsion to a country where they witnessed the worst horrors.  Imagine. . . #reportage #documentary #bangladesh #myanmar #genocide #nonrefoulement #women

Many of the older #Rohingya have been #refugees in Bangladesh before. Bodiur Rahman was a refugee in 1978 when the #Bangladesh goverment forced Rohingya to go back to #Burma by restricting food. The rate of deaths increased sharply in the camps. Thousands died of starvation.  Bodiur comes from Tula Toli. ONLY 5 MONTHS AGO, the #Myanmar military perpetrated their worst massacre there. Will he be forced back? . . #reportage #documentary #journalism #humanrights #nonrefoulement #pushback

Helping grandma. In the #rohingya #refugee camps children fetch water and firewood. They are vulnerable to #trafficking when walking alone.  I have even seen children as young as this boy acting as the main cook for the household.  Lack of educational facilities impacts on them in a variety of ways, and increases chances of early marriage, exploitation and trafficking.  #bangladesh #refugeecamp #bnw #blackandwhite

Mohammed Shoaib was shot in the chest. He vomited blood as he waited for a trafficker/smuggler/saviour to take him to Bangladesh on a boat. A stranger paid £280 for Shoaib, his three brothers and his dad. In Bangladesh it took a total of 50 days and several clinics and hospitals to sort him out. Why did this child have to go through all this? Please ask Aung San Suu Kyi. . #rohingya #genocide #myaar #bangladesh #aungsansuukyi #bnw #blackandwhitephoto #blacknwhite #blackandwhite

So begins her life as a #refugee in the camps of Bangladesh. . #myanmar #genocide #scorchedearth #bnwphotography #bnw #blackandwhitephoto #blackandwhite #refugeeswelcome

The #rohingya use boats like this to escape Myanmar, and cross the Naf river to Bangladesh. They mostly do this at night - in pitch darkness.  Even in calm waters it can be unnerving.  There are drownings almost everyday given the trafficking system that operates.  Bangladesh must change this and permit safe passage. . #RescueTheRohingya #genocide #boat #trafficking #smuggler #saviour #bnw #blacknwhite

No end to the #Rohingya tragedy.  This scene 30 mins ago on Marine Drive, Teknaf.  Rohingya call the Naf river the "Naf river of corpses". Bay of Bengal will be similarly renamed if the Burmese military continue to get away with it all. #corpses #deadbody #children #myanmar #aungsansuukyi

I interviewed a woman from Tula Toli  whose 16 month old daughter was thrown onto a burning pyre alive. The toddler died.  The woman (not in pic) spoke softly. When I asked her daughter's name her voice broke and she sobbed uncontrollably. The girl's name: Sohaifa. #rohingya #burma #myanmar #refugee #refugees #genocide #aungsansuukyi #war #conflict #tulatoli

In No Man's land they had no plastic. Now at Kutupalong they have plastic BUT they had to buy it. They have not constructed a hut yet. That will have costs too. In the meantime they will stay like this.  And it rains night and day. The humanitarian response has been woeful. #rohingya #myanmar #refugees #ethniccleansing #kutupalong #bangladesh

I took this image 30 mins after she and her husband were knifed and shot -  just metres from the zero line at Tummro.  Just metres from the safety of #Bangladesh.  Senseless act when they were doing exactly what Burma wants - leaving for Bangladesh.

Over the last two years there has been a visible rise in people sleeping rough in #Cambridge. In February, a Cambridge University student hit the news when he burnt a £20 note in front of a homeless man. His actions mirrored one of the reported initiation ceremonies of Oxford University's Bullingdon Club, where you have to burn a £50 note in front of a  homeless man. The Cambridge student was a member of Cambridge University Conservative Association. The Bullingdon Club of course boasts former Conservative British Prime Minister, David Cameron, as a former member.  What gets me is that people are incensed by these offensive pranks. And yet people are not outraged  by sweeping cuts to the welfare system and the lack of affordable homes for people to live in. #homeless #tory #conservative #socialcare #sleepingrough #shelter  #welfare #socialsecurity #care

A typical #Rohingya #refugee home in Bangladesh. The PM, Sheikh Hasina,  yesterday  described the conditions as "inhuman."

4 years since #RanaPlaza. 4 years since I took this shot of a mother asking a truck driver if he has loaded the body of her missing daughter in the back of his truck. No progress in bringing to book those responsible. At risk factories still continuing to function. No dignity was afforded to the dead and injured at the time in what was the most chaotic and disorganised rescue operation imaginable. And none since. #sweatshops #cheapclothes #labour #bangladesh #exploitation #corruption #garmentworkers #anniversary #disaster #labor #HumanRights #bnw #blackandwhite #blacknwhite

Innocent #rohingya children. In #Bangladesh they will be deprived of a meaningful education. They are expected to remain within the confines of their refugee camp even after they become adults. Indeed, especially after they become adults. They will also have a life of inferior quality healthcare - dependent on organisations like @doctorswithoutborders who simply dont have the capacity to deal with the numbers of refugees currently in Bangladesh.  In #Myanmar, Rohingya #children are herded along with their parents into IDP(Internally Displaced People) camps. These have been compared to concentration camps and  were recently the subject of a #BBC investigation. Today marks the first anniversary of #AungSanSuuKyi coming to power. She marked it with an interview she granted to the BBC. In it the  famous #nobel peace laureate effectively said that all the #UN and #HumanRights groups are basically lying and making up stuff about Rohingya persecution in #Rakhine state. A disgraceful politician who will leave a shameful legacy. . . #kutufalong #makeshift #teknaf #genocide #maungdaw #sonya7sii #portrait #refugeecamp #refugees #everydayrefugee #everydayeverywhere #documentary #reportage #kids #girl

This is not an ordinary kid.  He will  only study to Class 6 if that. His parents will struggle to feed him three times a day.  He will find it difficult to find employment. He, like his parents, will remain stateless. He faces unalloyed discrimination throughout his life. His movements and that of his parents are controlled. This is all because he is #Rohingya #refugee and he and his family have been violently deprived of their land and livelihood in their home country #Myanmar. . . #kutupalong #kms #bangladesh #kid #documentary #reportage #persecutedMinority #documentaryphotography #iphone7plus #depthoffield #mobilephotography #aungsansuukyi #humanrights #burma #iphone7plus #portraitmode #mobilephotography

Fixers! i am going to post a series of photos celebrating the great fixers i have worked with in the last few years. A well known italian journalist once said: “Without translation I would be limited to the borders of my own country. The translator is my most important ally. He introduces me to the world.” I am not aware if anyone has said anything as nice about fixers. But people should. The project fixer plays an essential role in any international documentary project. Translating is only part of his/her job.  A good fixer needs to go the extra mile! Anyway, first up is gandhian philosopher and analogue photographer,  Madhavan (right in photo). We did a project on ship breaking together. It is true he got us thrown out of a part of the state of Gujerat but hey so what.... ;) . . #fixer #documentary #reportage #shipbreaking #india #travel #wanderlust #india #cnntravel #everydayeverywhere #environment #shipbreaking #journalism #journalist

The Singer SM100-3. One of the cheapest #motorcycles you can get in #bangladesh  As one reviewer said "it doesn't look good and at that price you don't really care what it looks like". LOL They cost about 650 GBP. You can routinely see a whole family on one of these. Dad wears the only helmet. Mum and young child do not wear helmets.

#Rohingya testimony : "My husband was beaten to a pulp. We left him behind on the other side. I couldn't find my youngest child." Dulu fled her village in #Myanmar to escape the brutal crackdown initiated by the burmese military in October 2016. Since then about 70,000 people have fled to neighbouring #Bangladesh. Over 50 percent of Rohingya women interviewed by a UN team reported having been raped. They all related tales of murder and mayhem, including the killing of children. . . #maungdaw #rohingyarefugees #teknaf #refugeecrisis #refuges #aungsansuukyi #rape #violence #genocide #ethniccleansing #blacknwhite #blackandwhite #bnw #reportage #documentary #photojournalism #allrohingyanow

Mohammed Muslim showing me his injuries. He was severely beaten and left for dead by the #Myanmar military. The next day his neighbours found him in a field and carried him to safety. He was a small farmer working his own land in Moulbi Bazaar,  #Maungdaw. He led a frugal but happy life with his family until the crackdown by the #Burmese military last year. The military operation has seen over 70,000 rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh alone - fleeing murder, rape and mayhem. Now Mr Muslim is in a makeshift #refugee camp in southern #Bangladesh. . . #ethniccleansing #aungsansuukyi #refugees #rohingya #rohingyarefugees #teknaf #ukhiya #genocide #documentary #reportage #asia #refugeecamp #testimony #refugeecrisis #conflict #sonyalpha #photojournalism

Today @dhakatribune published video testimonies & pics of the courageous young #Rohingya women I spoke to in the refugee camps of southern #Bangladesh. They are recent arrivals from #Myanmar having fled a campaign of murder, rape and terror in Rakhine state by the #burmese army.  Link in my bio.

Can documentary film and photography ameliorate the situation of #Rohingya? Given what has happened to them? I am reminded of a certain critic’s comment that photography (and art more generally) can not cause anything “but the tiniest ripple on the surface of  our collective disengagement”. #aungsansuukyi #burma #myanmar #rakhine #rohingya #refugees #refugeecamp #refugeecrisis #pushback #teknaf #bangladesh #girl #poverty #stateless

Listen to the #alternativefacts coming from #Myanmar & you will learn that #Rohingya are burning their own homes, killing their own children and raping their own women. And then  bribing their way to BD to beg on the streets. Because they are, after all, #Bangladeshi.

According to the #Myanmar authorities, #Rohingya are burning down their own homes.  Why?  So that they can abandon everything to sit out at night along the highways in #Bangladesh?  And beg for food like this old woman? Have you heard anything more absurd? I took this image last month when the temperatures dropped very uncomfortably in the evening. And there were infants and little children too. That #aungsansuukyi cannot even acknowledge Rohingya suffering shows how intractable this problem is. . . #maungdaw #rakhine #teknaf #ethniccleansing #military #burma #refugees #rohingyarefugees #nonrefoulement #pushback #photojournalism #documentary #reportage #bnw #bnw_planet #blackandwhite #blackandwhitephotography #sonyalpha #womansmarch #poverty #genocide #blacknwhite #refugeecrisis #everydayrefugees #refugeecamp

Last month I filmed a group of extraordinary women. #Rohingya women. They spoke to me about their experiences of rape and murder in Aung San Suu Kyi's Burma. They saw no reason to hide their faces.

#Rohingya #refugees by the roadside near #Teknaf in southern #Bangladesh. I have been taken aback by the anti-rohingya discourse in Bangladesh. It is quite strong and interestingly mirrors the anti-immigrant propaganda in Europe and UK.  Rohingya are variously stigmatised as potential terrorists, spreaders of disease and primarily interested in baby production.  You hear this fascistic discourse from politicians, journalists and other educated people  right down to the man on the street. . . #excluded #refugeecrisis #refugees #everydayrefugees #refugeecamp #poverty #destitute #myanmar #myanmarburma #violence #ethnic #ethniccleaning #blessedarethemeek #sonyalpha #documentary #documentaryphotography #reportage #aungsansuukyi #asia #documentinglife

This #rohingya man was beaten yesterday by #Burmese soldiers as he neared the #Bangladesh border. His physical pain was sufficient to make him cry though he tried to compose himself when I entered the hut he is taking shelter in.  He has no idea where the rest of his family are. He escaped with his wife but not before he was set upon by Burmese #soldiers. I asked him what happened - he said "Nothing. Nothing compared to what has happened to my brothers." He left his home about three weeks ago, and it took days of hiding in various places before he managed to get to Teknaf. Atrocities against  the Rohingya continue unabated as far as I can gather from the testimonies I have filmed. . . #rohingya #burma #myanmar #military #beatings #rakhine #bengali #teknaf #documentary #reportage #humanrights #ethniccleansing #ethnic #bnw #bnw_captures #blacknwhite #blackandwhite #testimony #myanmarburma #refugees #refugeecamp #refugeecrisis

#Rohingya #refugees by the roadside in Teknaf earlier tonight. It is cold. Even I am wearing a coat and I am used to the weather in the UK. People are huddled in groups. Some have made fires using twigs and leaves. These are the unlucky unregistered. They depend on begging and aid from various NGOs. Some of the kids are in a bad way. Looking as if exhaustion has set in.

There was utter mayhem in this hospital. There were patients with serious burns or fractures or wounds lying on the floor in the landing outside of the actual ward. The ward itself was crammed full of patients and their family members, occupying every little bit of space - even under hospital beds. There were people with bandaged legs propped up with brick weights. This nurse in the picture - I have her on film shouting out "Who needs an injection?" This is Chittagong Medical Hospital. Jammed full of patients well beyond its operating capacity.

The "Beautiful Bangladesh" tourism campaign has slick videos and an OTT message about tourism in #Bangladesh. The reality is that in places like the south of Bangladesh where I took this image, the tourism boom is happening in a way that is destructive to the environment, unsustainable as a business and dangerous for tourists too!

In #Myanmar the #Rohingya are systematically denied access to #health care by a variety of means. In the Internally Displaced Persons camps, where the Rohingya are  herded and what has been termed by the  New York Times  as equivalent to "21st century concentration camps", infant and maternal mortality rates exceed that which pertains in the wider community. Diarrhoea and malnutrition play a big role. Writer Azeem Ibrahim even notes the case of an NGO which was effectively told not to provide cleft repair to Rohingya babies such as this one. We continue to hear about the Democratic Transition in #Burma. It is insultingly meaningless and even murderous for the Rohingya. . . #mother #child #cleftlip #medical #urgency #genocide #antimuslim #AungSanSuuKyi #saffron #IDC #refugees #createthenews #refugeecrisis #bangladesh #teknaf #reportage #documentary #cnnireport

A shy smile from this young #Rohingya girl as I point my camera at her. She left #Myanmar some years ago principally because of the difficulties of marrying. The Myanmar government has long imposed various and severe restrictions on the basic freedoms of Rohingya, including marriage, permission to marry and childbirth.  #Rakhine state has recently  witnessed appalling and escalated violence against the Rohingya, and hence large numbers have fled to #Bangladesh where they face further trials and deprivations.  The targeting of rohingya marriage is because of a widely held fear by chauvinist Buddhist forces that the muslim Rohingya will overwhelm the country with their birth rate. . . #persecution #ethnic #religious #documentary #reportage #everydayrefugees #refugeecrisis #photojournalism #burma #nonrefoulement #migrants #migrantcrisis #cnnireport #createthenews #asia #teknaf #children #migrantchildren #racism

Of all the issues I covered in 2016, the #Rohingya was the most troubling. The world is witnessing persecution which could easily slip into genocide.  #Myanmar is politically and even culturally set against this community. And the response from #Bangladesh is appalling too. This image is of new arrivals from Myanmar - many with stories of death and mayhem to tell. It is cold in BD right now. These people will be living in flimsy plastic sheeted tents in scrap land with little or no access to sanitation or other facilities. . . #persecution #ethnic #religious #documentary #reportage #everydayrefugees #refugeecrisis #photojournalism #fujilm #xpro1 #blackandwhite #bnw_captures #blacknwhite #burma #nonrefoulement #migrants #migrantcrisis #cnnireport #asia #teknaf #children #migrantchildren #fujilove

What horrors has this little #Rohingya girl seen? She and some of her family escaped from Burma with their lives - but the crisis in her life has not ended. Ignoring their desperate attempts to  seek safety, Bangladesh is forcibly turning back Rohingyas  in contravention of the international principle of non-refoulement - a prohibition under international law on forcibly returning people to a country or place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations. Many of the new comers hide. Women with babies, children and older men have set up temporary makeshift camps. They are totally dependent on the local population and certain aid organisations for sustenance and shelter.  Speak to any of them,  they will tell you they don't want to stay in Bangladesh but they have no choice given the murderous "collective punishment" being meted out by the Burmese military.  #teknaf #naf #river #myanmar #ethniccleansing #burma #atrocities #human rights #portrait #bnw #blacknwhite #blackandwhite #rohinga #ethnic

Maersk's North Sea Producer - the ship I filmed in Bangladesh as part of a Danwatch investigation - has turned out to have elevated levels of radioactivity. The authorities have stopped the shipbreakers from breaking it until further notice. After I took these shots, I was locked in a yard and made to delete photographs on my phone.

A huge section of a ship is cut and plunged into shallow water. In Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh the Danish shipping giant Maersk are involved in unsafe labour and environmental practises. We found a worrying lack of personal protective equipment - including workers without proper gas masks, and wearing plastic flip flops or going barefeet. There was also a total lack of employment contracts.

Maersk is the world's largest shipping company and is an enabler of global trade, connecting goods to people and economies around the globe. Sadly it also sends its old ships to be broken by companies in developing countries where there are inadequate safeguards to protect ship breaking workers and the environment.

The ban on cow slaughter has been a central agitational device of the Hindu nationalists for many decades. In practice this has become a way of targeting cow-eating and cow-slaughtering Muslims, not to actually improve the welfare of the actual cows. In my recent trip to #india I was appalled by the treatment of roadside cattle, donkeys and dogs. #religion #politics  #communalism #animal #welfare #sustainability #sonyalpha #reportage #documentary
