#UNISPACE50‬, the fiftieth anniversary of the first United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space wrapped up yesterday in Vienna. 29 heads of space agencies attended to discuss the future course of global space cooperation for the benefit of all humankind. Many countries pledged to the #Space2030 Agenda and implementation of #UNSDG in various capacities and we had a Skype call with the crew of the International Space Station, including use of the UN Russian translators! What a great reunion with so many friends from around the world. Looking forward to the future we will build together in the space sector. First photo is the future space leaders, second photo is the current space agencies heads. Please note there were only two women in the current 29 person group. #mymoonvillage #spacegen #youresa

The premise of the new #RodinExhibition at the @britishmuseum is that the Parthenon – and by extension the BM – made Rodin the artist who produced The Kiss and The Thinker and the Gates of Hell. Rodin first visited the great friezes that decorated Parthenon’s upper levels, in 1881 at the BM. Although he never went to Athens, Rodin’s relationship with the art of ancient Greece was profound & it was the work of one man in particular, the sculptor Pheidias who truly gripped his imagination. Rodin acknowledged Pheidias’s artistic genius by saying that no artist will ever surpass him (He is said to have designed the Parthenon friezes). Both #Rodin and#Pheidias, we are told, were consumed with the idea of movement, with twisting torsos & flowing forms. Take Ilissos, a river god from the west pediment of the Parthenon, who languidly pulls himself out of the water. Around half of the surviving reliefs from the Parthenon are in the BM after Elgin plundered them but BM has always defended its ownership, despite Greece’s insistence that it would very much like them back. This exhibition adds to that conversation, by bolstering the museum’s claim that Parthenon’s sculptures belong to the world, not just to the Greek people. For sure, Rodin wasn’t the first artist to be struck by the magic of classical Greece. However, let’s also note that the Parthenon’s sculptures were never intended to be separated from each other, each separation diminishing the context in which they ought to be admired - the whole and complete narrative of Athens. The exhibition does not justify the BM's refusal to allow the #AcropolisMuseum to display the surviving pieces with views to the #Parthenon itself. Nevertheless, what this exhibition does so eloquently is to set out the work of two great artists, separated by about 2,500 years, as though they cut from the same cloth. We may never know what went through Pheidias’s mind as he conceived the Parthenon friezes, but here we can observe the timelessness of the creative process and eavesdrop the whispers between Rodin and his classical mentor from the 5th century BC. “Ό,τι χάνει η Ελλάδα, το κερδίσει η Ανθρωπότητα” #museumlover #athensvoice

The Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle has an amazing collection of some of the most iconic guitars/ damaged by Kurt Cobain on stage.

Great experience to spent a week at the European Commission 🇪🇺 I’m positively surprised by the professionalism and dedication of the Horizon2020 program coordinators. It will be interesting to see how much money EU countries will invest on the next 7-year research budget (FP9). In the meantime, thank you EU for the “Roam like at home”, the new Greek highways, GDPR, Erasmus, net neutrality and so much more.

One of the top public construction projects in the world! Magical undersea train 🚂 between the UK 🇬🇧 and France 🇫🇷 where you drive on one side, and come off the other and everyone is driving on the opposite side of the road! London to Brussels in just two hours! The UK and French terminals are named Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, respectively. Cute! Oh and you can make phone calls and use the Internet under the sea. Bizarrely only in one of the two tunnels... I cannot wait for the new EU train between the Scandinavia and Mediterranean Sea. Soon to be the biggest construction site in the European continent 👌 Νo #8562 to love the 🇪🇺❤️ (Fucking Brexit is expected to increase passport control time) #eurotraining #europe #engineering #train #EU #passionpasport #globetrotter #lifo #athensvoice #instalifo #roadtrip

One of the steepest streets in the Western Hemisphere, Filbert Street has a gradient of 31.5 percent. The road’s steepest segment is between Leavenworth and Hyde Streets, which is reserved for one-way traffic down the hill. Because the eastern portion of the hill is too steep for vehicles, many homes in the area are accessible only by the Filbert Steps, a pedestrian-only flight of wooden and concrete stairs. This 400-step staircase was built to help people climb the steep hill. The stairway leads pedestrians through a garden, the coit tower, scenic ocean views, a tranquil pathway surrounded by beautiful Art Deco buildings and the aroma of eucalyptus, oh and city parrots #sanfrancisco #filbert #california #streetphotography #travelphotography #traveltheworld #passionpassport

There is a lot of music history on the 700 block of Ashbury Street. These two Victorian houses directly across the street from each other have their own tale. The first house at 710 Ashbury was the the communal home and headquarters of the “Grateful Dead” between October 1966 and March 1968, including the famed 'Summer of Love' in 1967. The house became a fixture on the local music scene, creating a large fan base with their many free concerts. In their early days, the band also dedicated their time and skills to the Haight-Ashbury community, making available free food, lodging, music and health care to all comers, performing ‘more free concerts than any band in the history of music’. Various friends lived in the building, including Neal Cassady, famous as “Dean Moriarty” in Kerouc’s ”On the Road”, and John Perry Barlow. (See lhttp://www.difference-engine.co.uk/library/cassidy/cassidy.html for Barlow’s description of life at 710). The house was featured in a number of posters for the Dead but eventually was raid by the SFPD in October of 1967 and two band members were arrested. The raid was featured in the first issue of the Rolling Stone Magazine. At the same time, across the street, 715 Ashbury was the headquarters of the San Francisco Hell's Angels chapter causing a lot of incidents. Eventually 37 Hell's Angels and their girlfriends were hauled off to jail, along with four handguns, eight bullwhips, ten machetes, twelve daggers, and assorted drugs. So you had the Grateful Dead on the one side of that street, and the Hells Angels on the other. Kinda a nice juxtaposition — and the names play off each other, too. Dead and Angels.

Reasons to ❤️ SF:An Art Deco marvel in North Beach since 1931, with red velvet-lined walls, art deco styling, and a live mermaid swimming in the lobby. It’s like time traveling to late 20s. Founder Agostino Giuntoli left Tuscany, Italy in 1922 at the age of 19 and sailed to America. He spent five years working his way to San Francisco and found a job as janitor at the famed Palace Hotel. #sanfrancisco #artdeco #bimbos365club #athensvoice #lifo #instalifo

“Connecting deeply and being seen by another are fundamental to being human. Connection is the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength.” ― @estherperelofficial @brenebrown Notice people. Show them they matter. Not just at Christmas. And in 2018, create a community around you, to help you be who you always wanted to be, and to fulfill what you came to Earth to do. There is nothing as magical as relationships that begin by dreaming big. Grateful to be surrounded by personal and professional communities who press on for a better world. Happy Christmas beautiful people, wherever you are🎄❤️🎁

Moon-day. 45yrs ago the last human mission landed on the Moon and a generation became orphans of Apollo. Today we expect a big announcement for @NASA to return to the Moon and stay this time. But I keep wondering, of all the people who could finally take @NASA back to the Moon, why did it have to be this President? 🌖💔I hope what he will announce to be an international and sustainable effort (#MoonVillage) and not flags and boots for a show. If the White House announces a real, sustainable, international and permanent lunar program, leveraging commercial players and NASA as an R&D support solution, we would be in the right direction #myMoonVillage #backtothemoon #spaceexploration #nasa #moon #lunar

What a great week at @spaceuniversity with old and new friends. “You could either watch it happening or be part of it” they say. How motivating is it to brainstorm how to enable humanity’s first lunar settlement with the @europeanspaceagency Director General, Astronauts, space industry directors and incredibly smart, talented and passionate people from all around the world! We all share the same passion and desire to expand into space and this is just the start of the #moonvillage community. 🚀👩‍🚀🌓 #mymoonvillage #spaceexploration #space #moon

Photos from this week’s @unoosa High Level Forum in Dubai, where participants adopted recommendations on the use of space for socioeconomic development. They also noted the role of space exploration in diplomacy and diplomacy in space, and space as a new frontier for peace on Earth. The challenge I posed to the global space community? How can we balance the increasing role and initiative of private spaceflight capabilities with the responsibility of government investment to promote the public good and equal access to space? #HLF #mymoonvillage #spaceexploration #moon #spacewatchme #SGAC #isunet @moonvillageassn #athensvoice #lifo #instantlifo

NYC thank you for these unexpected summer days and nights. You warmed the parts of my heart chilled by the horrors of last week and you reminded me of what a gift life is, and what an honor it is to get to hang out with such brilliant and diverse people @nuncaduermo @flaneur @epmid @chriswoebken @federicort I look forward to seeing you again. Paths that cross will cross again. 🌎

A gigantic, glowing model of the Moon came to NY this weekend as part of an interactive exhibition for "Artemis," the new book by Andy Weir, author of "The Martian." His new book chronicles the adventures of a young woman and criminal named Jasmin Bashara, a resident of the first and only city on the Moon and is out in mid November! #mymoonvillage @youresa #artemisonaudible

What a unique experience to be invited by United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and UNWOMEN as one of the expert speakers to discuss the creation of a dedicated ‘Space for Women’ Project at the UN Headquarters in New York. I felt grateful to finally be at a space event with more than 5% women in the room and to meet diplomats and decision makers from around the globe, every shade of skin and language spoken. The whole UN building was a swirl of color and energy and buzzing and movement and importance and hope. I felt like I was in exactly the right place and yet, unsure of how to put all the pieces together. There is much to do and I'm going to trust that my role in all of this is becoming clear. Fully integrating and empowering women in leadership positions is the most important step that a country or organization can take to strengthen its competitiveness and innovation. However, a look into the gender distribution at a “Head’s of Space Agencies Panel” is enough to understand that space leadership has largely remained a “men’s club”. Exploring what holds women back from stepping into leadership and decision making roles in the space sector requires looking beyond the obvious answers. To achieve systems change, we must pay attention not just to formal procedures, but also to organisational culture and unwritten rules and behaviors. How Might We help share the stories of more female hidden figures in the space sector? How Might We identify those men in the space sector who have helped women to take over leadership positions? How Might We tell the story of how women and men are able to form trusting relationships and help each other perform at a high level? #space4women @unoosa @europeanspaceagency @nasa @spacegeneration @moonvillageassn #mymoonvillage #spaceunites #spacediplomacy

The renovated Rijksmuseum will reach places that other art collections do not. Such as your heart. It reopened 4 years ago after a renovation that took ten years and cost nearly $500 million, tens of millions over its original budget. The museum is monumental, and this was a complete transformation, a triumph of curatorial intelligence and sensitivity. So much to see, from Vermeer to Van Gogh, Rembrandt to Mondrian. But my favourite moment of discovery, is the feeling I get when I push the heavy, creaking door to enter the vast, three-story cast-iron art history library, open to the public for the first time since 1885. What a book lovers fantasy: with high, arched, stained-glass windows and a single, corkscrew staircase to link it all together. Go visit.

When I was six year old, I crushed my bicycle and hit my head really bad. Since then, I totally abandoned bicycling and never missed it, even though I've lived in countries with strong bicycling culture. I was ruled by fear. Only until today though. Out of the blue, I felt a sudden urge to try and learn again. It took me about 15 min to remember how to balance and then I drove around the city for more than 40 min. Guess what, I loved the feeling!!! So here's my lessons from today: 1) If you are not embarrassed by whom you used to be one year ago, you are not learning enough. 2) Fear is the sign that a growth-inducing challenge might lie ahead. 3) If we don’t get uncomfortable means that we are not trying hard enough. 4) If we are always playing safe we will not get anywhere better. So cheers to bicycles 🚴

One of my favorite design thinking exercises involves unpacking all the assumptions you have about something and then turning them upside down to reveal alternatives. Our biases are usually so deeply integrated into our world view that is hard to see them. When you think you have identified a dominant pattern, think of the reverse story. Emphasize the less dominant parts. Your assumptions are your windows to the world. Scrub them off every once in a while or the light won't come in.

A creative and super low cost way to make millions of citizens curious about space exploration. By putting spaceship construction instructions on Amazon boxes @JeffBezos subtly prepares the world for a future where space exploration will be playful and hackable.

Moon Village welcomes Elon Musk. 😃#You_cannot_be_a_Martian_without_being_a_lunatic #changes #spaceexploration #mymoonvillage He just made a fool of his fanboys that spent past 2+ years thinking excuses for him going straight for Mars in mid 2020s without budget. Make Mars home was never going to happen. And now fanboys adopt rhetoric of people they criticised at every opportunity. Amusing. But I'm glad he is finally dropping the Mars only rhetoric.
