Someone skipped through the office offering Hallowe'en chocolate lollipops to everyone. Turned out to be chocolate-covered sprouts. If I find her, it's going up her left nostril. #Halloween #Samhain #trickortreat

I dragged Mum to her first #Pride parade today. She was talking about this #pug someone had put a feather boa on, and this drag queen overheard. The drag queen thought Mum was talking about her, and got a bit shitty! "First you call me a 'he', and then you call me a dog?! GIRL, BYE!" I nearly pissed myself laughing. Mum was mortified. Swipe to see the pug in question...

Finding complete and pure joy in the colours and textures of and on this tree. I've noticed a few leaves have started to turn brown, too. Sigh. I hope I can make the most of what's left of summer.

I don't know what the best part of this ice cream will be. The classic wafer cone? The creamy chocolate and vanilla swirl? The rainbow sprinkles? The Flake? Or, perhaps, the sound of the tears of small children splashing on the pavement as I walk past and make them jealous that I have this and they don't?

I can't remember the last time I went to the beach - and went in for a swim! I forgot to take my pants off from under my swimming shorts, though, so it's a squelchy afternoon ahead for me. Sigh. I'd forgotten how much I love being underwater, and how much I hate not being able to see a thing down there. I also discovered the gross crusty yuck that is a salty beard. Bleh.

And, suddenly, I'm quite fond of taking a selfie. I'm becoming increasingly comfortable with, and confident in, the way I look; also, I don't want to rely on my memories of how I looked at this age when I'm much older.

Waitrose now emboss their watermelons. I think this is it - the single most middle class thing they've ever done. Yes, it'll be better for the environment because there'll be less need for stickers, but... But... But...

'Obligatory' new haircut selfie. I love the fact that there's this 'beauty' setting on my phone that makes me look vaguely human. My thanks to the fabulous, talented and highly skilled Rachel at @hardysalon for sorting me out the other day.

This is the first time in the five years Mum's had Jess that he's shared her sofa with me. He's not even hissing or spitting, or glaring threateningly in my direction. This is a proper Body Snatchers moment, I tell you. Where's the real Jess?! #cat #cats #catsofinstagram

Today, I baked for the first time in... Well, I can't remember when I last baked something. It felt good to break out the ingredients and my tools, but the new oven gave me the shits. Excuse me for thinking gas mark four was the same across all appliances. Bastard thing. I hope these have cooked properly. #bake #baking #cake #cupcake

This #bumblebee appeared to be having the time of its tiny black and yellow-striped life rolling around the inside of this #crocus. But... It ~is~ more than a little early to see them, isn't it? There were honeybees just a few metres away, too...

I popped to the park for lunch and made a new friend. I adore pigeons. I think they're fluffy and feathery and squishy and squidgy and so so so cute. This one gets a medal for valor, for having slowly walked up my leg to perch on my knee.

Late night lichen. I've been walking around these same streets for nigh on 22 years, now, and I've never noticed this lovely dilapidated old wall on one side of a car park. I wonder what else I've missed over the last two decades... Probably a lot more since I got my first smartphone. Boo.

A rare selfie... A few more lines under the eyes over the last few months and a bit more hair (curiosity got the better of me and I must admit that I quite like it) mean it's time to replace that mugshot I have everywhere. It's funny how people have changed the way they act towards me given the change in my appearance - they all act as though things must be more... Masculine for me these days. Nope. Still a genderqueer queer queen, honey.

So, I've been dunking bits of buttered baguette and cheese-filled Tuc biscuits into this soup I made, but I've accidentally turned it into a scary face and the thought of eating it is now giving me the creeps.

MORE DECORATIONS! Whilst waiting for my computer to update, I crocheted around some LEDs I had and further festooned my bedroom. No doubt I'll find some jingle bells or some pine cones or some other random festive shite to hang off this before the month's over.

These splashes of rain aren't happy that this is where their lives have taken them. Also becoming more concerned that I find more miserable #facesinplaces than happy ones...

Well, what can you do when a colleague shoves a box of doughnuts in your face and insists you partake in celebration of her birthday? The answer is, of course, take two.

I taught my mum how to use the camera on my phone, so of course she ran off to take a photo of her #cat. "I'm David Bailey!" She shouted as she handed back my phone. I'm very proud of her. Jess, judging by the look on his face, appears concerned about the future of his privacy given Mum's new skill. #cats #catstagram #catsofinstagram

I managed to fuss five random #cats this week. Clockwise, from top: dirty, dusty old stray who was so loving; tabby twat who tried to jump through @thecraftyelks' living room window and failed; collared beauty who stood on its back paws to be fed treats, tucking its front paws so it looked like a Jurassic Park velociraptor; beefy old puss who couldn't tell cheese Dreamies from my fingers, and a fluffy and skinny stray @gingerthreadhouse and I saw whilst walking home from @seeded_buttons one evening. Best. Week. Ever. #cat #catsofinstagram #catstagram

I remember the good old days when I used to be able to smash an entire late night #pizza with no problems whatsoever. This last slice, this solitary, single, lonely, isolated, alone slice represents everything I hate about getting older. Also, it's what's for breakfast tomorrow.

Beautiful afternoon checking out the farmers' #market in Winchester (4/4). No photo could do justice to the range of pinks in these radishes - and I love seeing the different shapes and sizes! It makes me so sad to see identical, cookie-cutter, homogeneous fruit and vegetables in our supermarkets.

Beautiful afternoon checking out the farmers' #market in Winchester (3/4). I'd always believed there was flavour in colour long before I knew it to be a fact. I bet these purple-ish carrots taste phenomenal.

'There's some f-' I didn't catch the rest. I knew what they meant. I knew where it would be. I RAN with a plate. Office buffet for lunch. On my way back to my desk, people asked me if I'd picked up food for all of my colleagues, too. HAHAHAHAHA.

I love a good ol' free gift or sample from a magazine. Today, I stitched the @dandelyne #cactus mini hoop #embroidery that came with the latest @molliemakes - adding a few little touches of my own to this pattern... Now I just need to find somewhere to display it!

A #latergram of my #grind from this morning. It's @nudeespresso's Mi Cielo, from El Salvador. The tasting notes said 'milk chocolate, red berries and hazlenut'. I tasted more dark chocolate and Brazil nuts, so not far off. It was a lovely start to the day. #coffee #espresso

To date, I've only ever lost one sock in the wash. Today, after about two and a half years of waiting to see if it turns up, I'm ready to give up. Its twin's about to go off to that great big laundry basket in the sky. Of course, this means I'll find the other one right after.

And this, possibly my favourite flower of them all - it was the ingredient in all my magic potions and perfumes growing up, and they will always remind me of the happiest, carefree childhood times.

A #latergram from a recent visit to the New #Forest. This beautiful little #yellow #flower was the only pop of bright colour next to a wonderfully sloppy and squelchy bit of marsh. Of course I nearly fell in.

These two books cost me £2, and a 30-minute 'conversation' with the bookshop owner in which she covered charity shops, book recycling, indicative reading lists at universities, the EU referendum, smuggling, animal husbandry, agriculture, international travel, Alice in Wonderland and Princess Diana conspiracy theories.

FLOOFY #LAMB BUM! There were two little lambs at the petting zoo who kept pushing their gorgeous soft and bouncy little bottoms in people's faces.

FLOOFY #ALPACA BUM! Brilliant, brilliant lunchtime at the petting zoo set up a few minutes' walk from my office. The floof was so thick on this one that my fingers sank all the way in to my knuckles.

Reposting from my @thefivetonine account: So, I'm finishing #NatStatWeek a day late - sorry! The last day was #WriteaLetterDay, and I chose to #write a short #letter to my future self, filling in another page of my #fivetoninediary as I did so. I often forget the importance of processes and products past in the development of my #creative future. If I don't acknowledge these, on what am I building?

Catching up with #NatStatWeek... I missed #HandmadeDay as I was busy choosing a fountain pen to take with me to a wedding reception (don't ask)... This is a #pencil case I #knitted for myself back in 2012 - and is still going strong! I very much enjoyed getting this out at work meetings at which everyone else thought srs bsns meant dull generic #stationery. #handmade #knitting

What fun, popping in to @seeded_buttons on #YarnShopDay and meeting @knitforvictory! It was an absolute pleasure to meet someone who really 'gets' #craft and #creativity - and to get my filthy mitts on a copy of her book!

Catching up with #NatStatWeek... I missed #ThankYouThursday because I was too busy staring at the rainbow of half-pans in my watercolour set... This may be a weird one, but I'm thankful to my ex-boyfriend, now my very good friend, Steve, for always having been on hand to take me #stationery shopping when I feel a bit down in the dumps. And for not saying a word when I started to keep bottles of #pencil shavings around the flat because they look pretty - a habit I've kept up in the year and a half I've been single.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c8bb8bffb213c111fe67cfd6812bfb0d/5BDC46F6/t51.2885-15/e35/13098870_1732323590322325_111694397_n.jpg
Catching up with #NatStatWeek... I missed #WorldStationeryDay because I was too busy rubbing my collection of brand new notebooks on my face. I bought these Japanese #pencils in a little family-run independent stationers in Granada, Spain. I was on the Erasmus scheme and would often pop in there when I felt a little homesick. I used to chat to the couple who owned it, and they would always pretend to be shocked that anyone could love pencils as much as me. Thinking about it now, perhaps they really were surprised... Anyway, their stock of items from all over the World always made me feel at home. I've never forgotten their kindness, and those pencils still work perfectly - eight years on!

So, today is #GetOrganised day as part of #NatStatWeek. I'm sharing a picture of my @passionplanner, a wonderful combination of agenda and #journal that helps me with the exploration and organisation of my #creative life. And, even though I may run out of space in this planner, I'll never run out of battery nor not have enough signal as so often happens with the cloud-based calendars I use on my smartphone, too.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ae3406b02a15759c24fd5fd7dcc3455e/5BE80280/t51.2885-15/e35/12965110_1198363650197311_1917990011_n.jpg
Day one of #NatStatWeek is #PencilDay. #Pencils are, most probably, my most important #creative tool. I find it so easy - and so pleasurable - to use these for all kinds of #drawing, mark-making, #sketching and #writing. The same instrument can give you so many different degrees of accuracy in your work and the changes in your mood can have the most phenomenal impact on your interaction with it.

Staring at some streetlight-lit (streetlit?) #blossom whilst waiting for a taxi. Seeing the delicate little #flowers warmed by the glow of a humming bulb always takes me back to being in Spain at this time of year for some reason. I love #spring.

One of my favourite* things about visiting @thecraftyelks is getting to hang out with these cutie pies. #cat #cats #catsofinstagram *OK, so it's actually my favourite thing.

Another one from today's trip to the sea life centre with @thecraftyelks and @giacatkinson: a stunning Mandarin Goby. I'm always hypnotised by the patterns on these gorgeous little #fish.

Unexpected trip to the local sea life centre today with @thecraftyelks and @giacatkinson, where we saw these incredible #rainbow sea cucumbers. The colours are, of course, even more incredible in person.

A few splashes of black #watercolour in my palette giving me an unseasonal #facesinplaces today - this kind of spectral tomfoolery is best left until October, don't you think?

Popping to @thecraftyelks' home this evening to pick up something I'd left there turned into dinner, and that turned into an evening of being thoroughly ignored by her cats. Kenickie here was far more interested in, of course, a TV programme about his extended feline family. #cat #cats #catsofinstagram

The progress of my quick #orange slice #doodle using #pencil, #watercolour pencil and #fineliner #pen. I think my favourite part is somewhere between when I pencilled in the #colour and when I applied water.

A quick #doodle of an #orange slice using #pencil, #watercolour pencil and #fineliner #pen. I needed to do something to focus my mind for a few minutes and this was the perfect #creative cure for my confusion. I see this becoming a regular source of comfort when things get a little too much.

I managed a little more of my #embroidery project today, and practised some chain #stitch and some French knots. It'll be a while before I get back into the swing of things, and I'm looking forward to being able to track my improvement across the finished piece.

I crept up behind Mum as she was fussing Jess and took over. He turned around after about three minutes and realised the hands scritching him up and down were mine, after which he hissed and turned to face the wall, because he's so disgusted by this treachery that he can't even look at us. #cat #cats #catsofinstagram

No, it's not a maquette of a futuristic cityscape. I'm performing late night emergency surgery on a laptop. This might be the year I revert to slate and chisel, people. This is a) too much fuckery, and b) too much fuckery at this time of night. Also, through my disassembly of this technological marvel, I've developed a new respect for the poor bastards who have to assemble these to start with.

Crisp, light in colour and making the flat smell absolutely incredible. And, if my parents have anything to do with it, I'll not taste a single one. They'll probably end up having six each and complaining I didn't make more. #baking #Christmas

Late night #Christmas #baking in progress: deep-filled mince pies with a maple-scented all-butter shortcrust. Phwoar.

So I tore off a piece of panettone (yes, I have even more) to eat and suddenly thought that it looks just like @bonitoclub's dog Kuma (sorry, Kuma, if you disagree). Weird because I've never met Tony or Kuma as they live on the other side of the planet. The Internet enables some very weird connections to be made.

And it's done! This thing smells so good, I'm finding it hard to not cancel all my plans for this afternoon so I can start eating it right away. #baking #Christmas

Time to get this gloriously scented bastard in the oven. Cloves, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon - in my special ratio to give maximum festive feels when you stuff it in your mouth. #baking #Christmas

The problem with buying a shitload of panettone from the reduced bin at the supermarket is trying to think of different ways to eat them before you get sick of the sight of them all lined up on your #kitchen counter. I'm about to turn one into a #panettone '#bread' #pudding - that I'll no doubt have all to myself later. #baking #Christmas

I picked up a belated birthday card from my mum last night. Every year, she puts my name in either inverted commas or quotation marks, as though she's trying to tell me that's not my real name...

I popped into Starbucks to get some coffee and met a Spanish lady who was travelling with her #cat, called Laura. Laura was born in England but only responds when spoken to in Spanish, so I had a great time being the only other person to whom she paid attention. They'd come down to Portsmouth from London on the train earlier this morning.

I'm so lucky that @thecraftyelks lets her cats use me as a chair.

Impromptu dinner in Brighton to end the week. Tapas followed by mini pancakes on the pier - and fending off hungry seagulls using a plastic fork.

I enjoyed (and lost)a pencil-sharpening contest earlier with @tjfirefly_piggy. She unintentionally made this beautiful pencil shaving star from one continuous twist

And also by this rather impatient one. Never underestimate a pigeon's love for a sausage roll.

Lunch with my mum, AKA sausage rolls on a bench in th sunshine. We were joined by this lovely little critter...

I went for a walk along the seafront and found a pebble that looks like bacon. It's made me so happy.

I spent most of my lunch break earlier captivated by the bees in Victoria Park. I loved these two jostling on a thistle - I wonder who got the most pollen...

This beautiful little #fledgling was in immediate danger of being squished by a car, so I moved it to a safer location near where I found it. I hope it survives and then thrives...

Despite only being a few weeks old, Rizzo has already figured out that humans are beneath her - literally. I was trying to take a photo of her brother and she climbed on top of me and fell asleep... I bet @thecraftyelks will make an excellent slave for her and her brother. #CornishRex #kitten

This is the most incredible #Southsea #sunset I've seen in a long time: the underside of the clouds is being lit up by this almost neon orange-pink light to which no camera, photography technique or Instagram filter would ever be able to do justice. We will never see things as clearly as we can do with our own eyes.

A few of my favourite flowers so far this #spring... This much colour in the city makes me smile so much.

I retrieved this fantastic length of rope on my walk home along #Southsea seafront this evening. Once it's dried out and lost its fishy aroma, I'll apply my #crochet skills to it and make a rope basket.

My mum bought some plants as a present so, of course, Jess started chewing them up. If he's not getting a present, no one's getting a present.

It makes me sad when the blossom starts to fall from the trees, but I do love wading through flurries of it on pavements and along roads.

Another old #Southsea seagull photo. This one had its back to all the other seagulls along the seafront.

I got my hands on my first pair of glasses since 2008 this afternoon. I absolutely love them. Also, I love how, if you look at me straight on, they make the sides of my head appear to come in. Y'know, I might give up contact lenses for these!
