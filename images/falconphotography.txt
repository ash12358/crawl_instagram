So yesterday, before my first meeting as PPGH’s 2018 President, I received a gift from a member and good friend. I’m not sure if the gift is something she knows about how many hours of sleep I will be missing this year or just because she knows I drink @communitycoffee. If I have to use coffee to help me get the job done at least I know that I will be enjoying every cup I drink to be the best president for PPGH.

So it snowed here in Nashville. Nice little present for us southerners who do not have it very often. Also it’s the last day of ImagingUSA. Make the best of it my fellow photographers. Take those nuggets of information, the new friends you met (networking), and DO SOMETHING! Try to implement what you learned here at Imaging. Just 2-3 things and you will see progress and improvement in your skills and business. All the best to you and the best for 2018!

So our Keynote Speaker encouraged us to act like superheroes because it’s proven that if you stand in a superhero pose for at least 60 seconds, you will train your yourself to act like a superhero in your daily life… Or at least that is what my takeaway was… So here is PPGH members striking a pose and putting our superhero poses in action!

I want to say thank you to the veterans for your service and in some cases, sacrifice to keep this country the land of the free. THANK YOU! I’m so proud of my dad for his service in the military. It will be 4 years this month that we lost my father. He is on my mind regularly as a role model of a father, mentor, and a die hard LSU fan! ⠀ #VeteransDay #Dad⠀ #AirForce #TheHeights⠀ #FalconPhotography⠀ #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer⠀ #HoustonPhotographer⠀ #HeightsPhotographer⠀ #CommercialPhotographer #HoustonCommercial⠀ #ProfessionalPhotographer

Been trying to capture the rain gauge as I empty it to track how much rain we have received at the house. We have been very fortunate so far with the amount of rain and/or the duration of heavy rain we received. Last night was the first night that we started to worry as the rain was coming down at a rate of about 5 inches in a little over an hour. The ditches filled and the water started pooling in the yard which caused a sinking in our stomach. How much more can we take before water… and then all of a sudden it dropped to just a light rain. Radar showed a respite. Whew. Yes! Luckily, we only received about 1.5 inches overnight and about 5 inches for the whole day when I emptied the gauge again. Here are the pics from the rain we received since Friday night. I only missed one pic and it was a full gauge (5 inches). About 22 inches so far with more to come! We have so many friends who have water in their homes and many more who have water at the door. Our thoughts are with them and those who have lost something in this hurricane. #Harvey #Hurricane #Rain #HowMuchIsEnough #MoreRain #FalconPhotography #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #HoustonPhotographer #HeightsPhotographer #CommercialPhotographer #HoustonCommercial #ProfessionalPhotographer

At our house in Houston, we have been fortunate to only have received about 3 1/2 inches of rain so far (photo captured at 7:30 a.m. today). We know there is more to come so we are prepared to get many more inches. Hoping to capture and empty the rain gauge to record the amount of rain throughout the hurricane. Doing some cooking and will have food all ready in case (or when?) we lose power. Gas stoves are a lifesaver aren’t they? Hoping those that are in the direct path of hurricane will come out better than expected. Be safe out there! #Harvey #Hurricane #Rain #HowMuchIsEnough #MoreRain #FalconPhotography #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #HoustonPhotographer #HeightsPhotographer #CommercialPhotographer #HoustonCommercial #ProfessionalPhotographer

I got a little package from PPA today… And who doesn’t like a surprise package, right? Inside was a card and a 10 year membership pin. Woah! Yippee! Wow! Already?? It was surprising and exciting to receive the pin. Ten years sure snuck up on me. I will proudly wear it along with my other bling that I have earned as a part of my membership.

So this opened up recently down the street from the house. And I'm wondering about the name. Is it a requirement or optional? They do have picnic tables so maybe that's the idea. Come, eat a burger, drink some beer, and let the fellas just "hang out." Will report back once I have thoroughly investigated. #Burger #Hamburger #Food #FeedMe #TheHeights #BallsOutBurger #FalconPhotography #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #HoustonPhotographer #HeightsPhotographer #CommercialPhotographer #HoustonCommercial #ProfessionalPhotographer

So yesterday they predicted rain, thunderstorms, etc. I would say we got our fair share. Wouldn't you? And it is starting to rain again. Emptied gauge so I can see what today will bring. In addition to the rain, I had the pleasure to clear a fallen branch from our easement early this am to allow the wife to get to work. Always fun to clear the road in your boxer shorts and rain boots at 6:30am!

Very pleased that my Plumbago (Plumbaginaceae) came back from a hard freeze we had back in January. Gave it some TLC... weeded the pot, refreshed soil, & fertilizer. It's just what was needed. This week, I saw the beginnings of flower buds. Here's the first of many new flowers that are popping through.

Can’t wait. Must. Have. Now! @Communitycoffee and @Haydelsbakery king cake is a killer combo to complete my  morning. This cajun is so lucky to have a wife who heard me when I asked “Do you think they have a place in Houston that has a decent king cake?” She surprised me with a king cake delivery today. Ahhh!

Hard to believe we are capturing more images today than 20 years ago. Smartphones have contributed to this but the crime is that people do not PRINT any of the images. You should set a goal in 2017 to print a minimum of 12 images, one for each month this year.

A heavy rainstorm woke me about 3:50am this morning. A steady flow of rain/heavy rain over the next 4-5 hours resulted in a nice amount of rain at our house. So Houston, how did you fair in the rain today?

I have been having an envie for some étouffée. So I took care of that tonight. Shrimp… Ca c'est bon! I have many fond memories of family events and good cooking. One popped in my head while cooking tonight. On many Christmas Eves, we would cooked up pots of gumbo (chicken/sausage AND seafood). Invite friends and family to come make a pass by da house and visit for a while. Sometimes we would have 25-40 people who would show up over the evening. Great times! #ShrimpÉtouffée #CajunCooking #LipSmackinGood #Family #Thankful #FalconPhotography #HoustonCommercial #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #HoustonPhotographer #HeightsPhotographer

Enjoying a great evening at the Houston Rodeo. Food was soooo delicious I only left you a bite. Friend and wife's colleague, Dave Loveless, 2015-2016 Trail Boss for  the Devils River Mountain Men bbq cooking team provided the food!

Boudreaux on one of the many walks we share together. I get the privilege to join him on HIS walk. We sniff, we walk, sniff some more, walk... You get the idea. At one point he stopped and turned to look back at me as if to say "Nice sunset, huh?" Or at least that is what I am telling myself! #FalconPhotography #UniquePortraits #FunPortraits #HoustonPhotographer #DogPhotographer #PetPhotographer #phodographer

Was alerted by friend and photographer @kcphotoproductions that my name was in print in the February @OurPPA Magazine. Just picked up my mail and there it was... My name in print along with other PPA photographers who earned their certifications (CPP). Great to have made the journey and received the certification. Hard work and an attention to detail pays off! I have to give a shout out to @Tom7451, who was a mentor throughout this process pushing me to finish as well as being a great friend and advisor. Thanks Tom! #FalconPhotography #UniquePortraits #FunPortraits #HoustonPhotographer #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #CPP

Looks what's new! Oh, you're not sure you say... Take a look where the straw goes through the top. OK, I'll tell you. See the raised portion surrounding the straw, it prevents the liquid from spilling out to not the top when you push the straw into the cup. OK, so what you say. Well I think it's pretty innovative. Well done Chick-fil-A! #FalconPhotography #UniquePortraits #FunPortraits #HoustonPhotographer #CypressPhotographer #Chick-fil-A #PrettyNeat #designs

Kevin Falcon earned this designation after completing an intensive program that measures his artistic and technical competence. Professional Photographers of America currently recognizes fewer than 2,500 CPPs. Professional Photographers of America (PPA.com/CPP) is the leading body for certifying imaging professionals. CPPs must complete a written examination, finish an image evaluation and adhere to a strict code of conduct. Certification must be renewed on a periodic basis, ensuring continued confidence in the professionalism of Certified Professional Photographers. Certified Professional Photographers Give You Consistency. Certified Professional Photographers know how to achieve great results— every time. Technical Skills. Certified Professional Photographers are more than picture takers. They are students of art, lighting, posing, fashion and even interior design. Unique Artistry. Certified Professional Photographers have the skills to create unique, customized works of art—not cookie-cutter pictures. They follow an artistic vision. It’s your story captured as a collection of art. Professionalism. When you hire a Certified Professional Photographer, you know you’re getting someone who is willing to go the extra mile to deliver the best possible images. #FalconPhotography #UniquePortraits #FunPortraits #HoustonPhotographer #CypressPhotographer #CPP #CertifiedProfessionalPhotographer #PPA #SeeTheDifference

Here’s an image of the dog food we collected yesterday at our “Dog Days of Summer” pet charity event. We loaded the entire SUV with dog food. A huge THANK YOU to all who helped make this event a success. I didn’t get an exact count but I think that the total haul was well over 750 pounds of dog food. I’m very happy for Adore Houston who will continue their great work in saving rescues and help get them adopted to a new forever home. #FalconPhotography #UniquePortraits #FunPortraits #HoustonPhotographer #CypressPhotographer #PetPortraits #CharityEvent #Charity #Dogs #PawsPetResort #AdoreHouston

Falcon Photography and Paws Pet Resort had another successful “Dog Days of Summer” pet charity event! I am so happy for Adore Houston for the funds and the dog food we raised at this event. Here is an image of us at the end of the day with the many bags of dog food surrounding us. You really cannot tell how much dog food is around us but look for another image coming. Also, you wouldn’t know it my our smiles but we were plum exhausted.
