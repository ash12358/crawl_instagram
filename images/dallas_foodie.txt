Spending this lazy Sunday dreaming about the wonderfully al dente and #handmade #pasta from Carbone's at The Shops of Highland Park. Kicked off dinner with a glass of wine and the house made #ricotta and #garlic bread (not pictured). For my entr√©e, I went with the traditional #spaghetti in a light #plum #tomato sauce. The balance of tomato sauce (not excessive) to pasta to shredded Parmesan to the sprinkle of garnish was amazing! - SL

Ambrosial as the sweet uplifting sounds of Marley playing in the background; This authentic little Jamaican spot in the heart of Dallas, serves up a divine signature entree of sharp & vibrant flavors. Mama Joyce's Oxtails, full of rich traditional island ingredients, create this sharp & savory delectable gravy, for one of the most underrated, tender, fall-of-the-bone, juicy beef cuts. -IC

Adding in healthy(er) yet tasty dinner options to kick off the new year with this light but hearty build your own #pok√© bowl from P≈çk The Raw Bar in West Village. Started with a base of #bamboo #rice and chose ahi #tuna marinated in P≈çk's "classic" (aka slightly sweet soy) sauce for the protein. We were able to choose up to 4 complimentary toppings for BYO bowls, excluding a few "premiums" such as the ever so popular avocado. Decided on the #arare (mini spheres of rice crackers) for texture, sliced #cucumbers for crunch, fresh #ginger for detox, and #avocado for the soul. Loved the ability to fully customize and substitute! - SL

One of my fondest memories of #NYE is one spent in #NOLA a few years ago; Experiencing the music, good vibes, & by all means, the food! Needless to say, since then I've been on the search for some of that bonafide flavor here in #Dallas. Nola Grill is the closest thing I've found to authentic cajun-creole style cookin. Packed with dat famous nawlins' zest, & mixed with a hint of some good ol' southern comfort. Everything from the BBQ Jumbo Shrimp & Grits, to Duck & Andouille Gumbo, to the uniquely seasoned & spiced Blackened Redfish Crawfish #√âtouff√©e, will have your taste-buds rejoicing. Happy New Year & Bon Appetite! -IC

The Grape's #brunch exclusive - Classic Cheeseburger is no secret amongst #Dallasite brunchers & burger lovers. I might be a little late, but I finally got to try one. Unfortunately, the title of "Best Burger in Texas" awarded by TX Monthly, didn't live up to it. I admit I eagerly fed into the hype, & may have expected fireworks when biting into one; so here's a quick tip for you & your $14.. Grilled medium- even with the melted vermont cheddar- this huge 10oz. beef patty was dry & bland, it was hard to find any of that juicy flavor that makes a cheeseburger classic. The pain au lait bun was almost as big & bland, even a little bulky for an already thick patty. However, not all was just 'up to par', two things highly enjoyable were the Nathan's horseradish half-sour pickles & the house-made peppered bacon; which are the only two reasons I'd give this #burger a second chance. -IC #latergram

No better time than Saturday #brunch to indulge in a smothered breakfast #burrito from Public School 214. Stuffed with scrambled eggs, smashed #hashbrowns, and (breakfast staple) #bacon, the burrito then comes topped with a hint of #chimichurri, melted provolone, and freshly sliced #avocados to balance out a mimosa or four. - SL

Tequila lime chicken #nachos from Yucat√°n Taco Stand on Lower Greenville help satisfy my craving for carbs with a sprinkle of vegetables to cap off the weekend! #Guacamole, three types of melted #cheese, shredded #lettuce and purple cabbage, sliced #jalape√±os, and a drizzle of #garlic #aioli combine some of my favorite toppings in this one dish üôåüèº - SL

The Royal Couscous at Kasbah Grill is a tender slow roasted #Moroccan lamb shank over steamed semolina grain, topped with a melodious array of seasoned vegetables. Delightfully paired with mint tea, this dish is one which is full of flavor, filling, yet light. To first timers of #couscous , be well aware the texture of semolina grain is not quite like rice, it's a bit less fibrous, slightly course, yet zestfully complimented the extremely tender lamb meat. -IC

This drool-worthy 'Pimiento Cristo' couldn't have come at any better time of year while many Dallas Foodies celebrate by trying all kinds of fried food. However, this crunchy cheesy delicacy won't be found at the fair. New to Lower Greenville; Haymaker does not disappoint with it's list of creative comfort foods. Incredibly hearty, deep fried & beer battered- country loaf, stuffed with one of the most sublime melty homemade #pimiento cheeses I've had.

With the abundance of taquerias all over The Big D (yes, even the occasional gas station ones, not to mention any names), & with so many restaurants experimenting with unique flavors to create the perfect fusion tacos, not that I have anything against that, it's just easier to get lost in the mix than ever before. Due to the 'overwhelming' generosity of many of my hispanic friend's mothers, t√≠as, & abuelas, I've grown to respect the mouthwatering simplicity of an authentic taco. Small handsized (slightly greasy) corn tortillas, filled with tender juicy & flavorful meat, topped with diced onions, cilantro, & the spiciest salsa you dare to bare, because you have the lime to balance it out. Although I'm blessed to live in a city where I have many more yet to try, Taqueria La Paisanita is the closest I've come to that authentic comforting flavor. -IC #NationalTacoDay #TacoTuesday

Friday #lunch hour has me craving a fresh fish dish from HonSushi in Carrollton. This "Oh! Baby" roll is rice-less, stuffed with #crabmeat, #yamagobo, #seaweed salad, and subtle avocado then wrapped in generous servings of melt-in-your-mouth tender red #tuna!

Let your tastebuds explore with a mouth-watering authentic Pakistani meal; A delicious little hole-in-the-wall restaurant found in the heart of Richardson. I opted for the garlic #naan (soft baked buttery bread), the beef & chicken #seekhkabab (flavorfully spiced- grilled ground meat), & #nihari (traditional slow cooked, tender brisket-like beef curry).

These aren't just your average Loaded Cheddar Fries; for me & many Dallasites alike, these fries are what set the standard for how a solid satisfying plate of crisp smothered melty cheddar fries, fully loaded, should almost always taste. A proportionate array of flavors, shareable (not always), & most importantly- texture of cheesiness that's just right. -IC #Fryday

This Open Faced Beet Cured Salmon Sandwich from Remedy was my first...I mean they're as common as tacos in #Dallas right? (kidding) While the beet cure on the Scottish #Salmon was good it did leave a slightly bitter after taste.

The Super Freekah Bowl at Whiskey Cake in #Plano is so full of ingredients that I forgot I was eating a salad.

The Stuffed Avocado at Mudhen Meat and Greens is packed with flavor (literally). They slice an entire #avocado and "stuff" it with a curried chicken salad mixed with raisins, apples, apricots and almonds. It's a sweet, tangy and crunchy dish. Pairs well with the #Dallas heat. -KH

OG Phat-Thai is a m√©lange of rich spices & organic ingredients; emphasis on organic. Not too spicy, in fact compared to most other #PadThai I've devoured, I'd say this was on the milder side. Didn't care for the tofu fries, however appealing, one bite & I came to the realization my eyes had deceived my tastebuds. Needless to say, I'm not so big on/ nor do I ever crave tofu, so for some it might just hit the spot. However, I will return for the OG wok-fired delectable phat thai, just not so much the "fries". -IC

The #08 (Nut Party) at Local Press + Brew has become my go to when I'm craving something sweet and filling.

I'd heard that the Prospector's Breakfast at Boulevardier was one of their most popular #brunch selections...well here's why: The open-faced #omelette is full of thick bacon cooked into the eggs.

Delectable authentic Persian/ Mediterranean cuisine located in a retail strip behind the Galleria. I've had my fair share of little hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean lunch buffet's, but this has got to be one of my favorites. True to the family recipe, I always get the comfort food expected, & I've never left here surprised or unsatisfied.

I had to try the Pecan Wood Roasted Oysters at Ida Claire today. The idea of the roasted #oysters topped with a salad of brussels sprouts, #kale, pickled onions and #bacon was really intriguing. When I got it all in one bite it was perfect. (and this month doesn't even have an "R" in it! #myth) -KH

The Alamo burger from Goodfriend Beer Garden & Burger House is grass-fed beef topped with #brisket, jalape√±os, queso, tortilla chips and #avocado between a toasted bun. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to bite when all put together, but is a perfect bite when you figure it out.  Definitely memorable. (see what I did there?)

It's hard to decipher when you've waited in line for a few odd minutes, drooling over the wide array of pastries; but as soon as your #'s called, It's only natural that I went with what I'm most familiar with. Once sampled, my favorite out of the #Cannoli, #PecanWedge, & #LobsterTail, was immediately the Lobster Tail, simply because it was devoured the quickest. All of these magnificent treats were insanely sugary rich, but there was something about that Tail that just put me in a flakey, crisp, & sweet happy place. -IC

Savory, sweet, salty, and spicy: this flavor quadfecta is why #ChickenAndWaffles at Breadwinner's is a rare dish that makes the world stand still while your taste buds party on another planet.

The #RamosGinFizz is an elusive #cocktail find, largely thanks to the minutes of vigorous shaking required to get a proper foam head. And no one does head better than Parliament bar. üòè The two-inch head is best slurped though the straw to avoid being left with a white substance around your lips.

One of my favorite #desserts in Dallas is the bread pudding at The Old Monk. It's moist, doesn't contain nuts or raisins, and is absolutely swimming in a pool of Irish whiskey sauce. Their warm Ghirardelli brownie and ice cream sundae is also totally worth the splurge.

The spring menu at Snap Kitchen is full of variety and the Shrimp and Chorizo Paella is a great quick option for a light meal that is layered with flavors.  The #shrimp is seasoned with lemon juice that really brings out the taste of #Spring while the #saffron rice pays homage to traditional #paella. #‚ÄéDallasHealthyFood -KH

The Purple Haze Latte at Fourteen Eighteen Coffehouse is literally a soothing shot of energy.  The #lavender scented latte with a hint of #vanilla is full bodied, rich and eye opening.  It‚Äôs worth noting that this eclectic #coffeeshop in downtown #Plano brews Oak Cliff Coffee Roasters and serves Emporium Pies! -KH

If you love all things peanuts then you will love The Nutty Honey pie at Emporium Pies. To me it is reminiscent of a toasted peanut butter and honey sandwich that my mom used to make. I heard guests in the shop saying it reminded them of a #Payday candy bar. Whatever the memory it evokes the main ingredient is #peanut and if you‚Äôre not down for them then try another #pie. -KH

El Bolero offers a sensational homage to the authentic flavors of Central Mexican cuisine with the mouthwatering Al Pastor Con Grilled Pi√±a #tacos, carved fresh #DeTrompo style. A satisfying combo of achiote & pineapple relish on tender shredded pork fill each tortilla generously. Definitely some of the most tropically zestful, less greasy, flavorful al pastor de trompo tacos I've had the pleasure of devouring in #Dallas. -IC

The #SweetTooth in me craved fresh #baked creamy vanilla mascarpone, coated with #toasted marshmallows, drizzled with #nutella; aka The Edger: a spacial request, off-the-menu treat at Cane Rosso.

Sweet Potato Chip Duck #Confit from Ida Claire as the primary appetizer was amazing! Crispy sweet potato chips topped with goat cheese #fondue, #duck fat #gravy, and a sunny-side up #egg.

Yes, I had the Banana Pudding Cheesecake Jar from Val‚Äôs Cheesecakes for breakfast, and no I am not ashamed! The traditional #cheesecake is literally topped with #pudding and mini nilla wafers.

The quintessence of a uniquely crafted #burger, which considerably lives up to it's name, is The Burger Sauvage @theroyalemagnificentburgers. This 6oz beef patty is served atop fresh sprouts, and smothered with melted swiss, which envelop the sliced avocados & saut√©ed mushrooms; served with a side of some of the most #crisp Sweet Potato chips, & dished out to you on a silver platter.

Several of you recommended I try JOY Macarons in #BishopArts after my last #macaron post, and today I did.  I like how their #French confection has ample filling and they are very moist.  They have unique flavors like Rose and Lychee (tasty). My favorite today was the simple #vanilla flavor ‚Äì it was not too sweet I could actually see the vanilla bean in each bite.  Where should I try macarons next? -KH

New to the BIG D burger scene, straight out of West Texas, Heff's #burger joint is one that satisfies the hungriest #Texan. A must add to your bucket-list is the delightfully crafted 'Bucket Burger' which consists of a juicy 1/2 lb beef patty, topped with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, jalape√±os, & mushrooms, loaded into a warm tasty jalape√±o bun!

I finally made it to Smoke in #Plano for brunch. The Whole Hog BBQ Eggs Benedict is a fun and hearty take on a #brunch favorite. The pulled #pork is tangy with a little bit of spice. I expected the English muffin to be soggy but it held up well under the meat and poached #eggs. Tasty brunch option with a #Texas twist. -KH

This is a definite top favorite pizza of mine and I feel a little less guilty about eating it when it comes from @true_food_kitchen The house made #chicken #sausage and house made #crust are incredibly flavorful. The crust is thin and a little crispy. The chicken sausage is packed with flavor and herbs. Topped off with #fontinacheese tomato and fennel the taste is light and I had to stop myself from not finishing the whole thing in one sitting. - AV

The long awaited famous Las Vegas-joint 'Hash House A Go Go' has finally debuted in Plano, & it's everything we expected! Their specialty chicken & waffles are every Dallas Brunchers' dream come true. Piled high in humongous portions, this #brunch item is a perfect balance of sweet & savory, the flavorful chicken is crispy & so tender, plus the giant waffles are infused with delicious crisp strips of bacon, & served with some delectable syrup!

I had an "oh crap" (censored) moment, in a good way, when I took my first bite of the Texas Lamb Chop Lollipops at Pink Magnolia.  They were grilled to a perfect temp and had just the right amount of char and fat to make me smile.  The #chimichurri sauce that topped the #lamb was the perfect compliment.  I did not even taste the arugula bed they were on because...meat! -KH

Not for faint hearted foodies. The #BanhMi is one of my all time favorite types of #sandwich. Flavorful & fresh, this authentic #Vietnamese specialty is served in a crisp baguette, filled to the brim with an intense melody of; pickled carrots, daikon, cucumbers, spicy aioli, sriracha, & herbs.

Need to work some #green into your meal but don‚Äôt want anything dyed? The Chef‚Äôs Guilty Pleasure ramen from Skewers Shop can help. It‚Äôs a broth-less #ramen served with a onsen egg, green onion (yay green!), and pork belly skewers.

The #porkbelly skewers are grilled to order, with a little crispy char and melt in your mouth.  Happy #StPatricksDay! -KH

If there's one thing us #DallasFoodies know & love,  it's #Burgers & #TexMex! Why spend valuable minutes of your weekend debating over which to eat, when you can have it all with 'The South of the Burger' from Liberty Burger. It's a delicious beef patty- topped with melted cheese, topped with a generous amount of crunchy tortilla strips, lettuce, guac, pico, & refried bean spread straight on to the top bun. #Delicioso! -IC

My favorite part of the Oyster Po‚ÄôBoy at Ida Claire is the oysters. They are smoked then fried to perfection in a crumbly cornmeal batter. While the #oysters make the #sandwich the mirliton slaw ‚Äì made up of mostly pickled onions, carrots, green and red peppers - is a bit overpowering. The slaw gives the #poboy a great crunch and tang, but in my opinion there could be less of it on the dish. The bright side to the slaw is that you will get more than your needed serving of #veggies in! -KH

I don't eat #pancakes often, so when I do, I want really good ones. I count on The Porch's weekend #brunch menu. They make a stack of three, large-plate-sized, substantially textured, correctly cooked, pancakes with a sort of sweetened cream cheese (seen on top) layered in between each one. There's a light amount of maple syrup drizzled throughout and fresh berries on top. It goes down best with a $5 fresh-squeezed orange juice mimosa.

A favorite #brunch spot for me in #Dallas is @henrysmajestic The #chilaquiles has several unexpected twists which surprises my taste buds. It starts with a layer of blue corn tortilla chips and their moist #rotisserie #chicken topped off with a sunny side #egg and incredibly flavorful tomato #salsa - AV

Perhaps the most secret delicacy on the winter menu at Emporium Pies is their #hotChocolate. It's similar to the thick, real #chocolate and cream hot chocolates I drank in Paris. I've searched Dallas for similar versions, and this is one of the best! And because everything Emporium makes is better than the usual, they top it with a housemade #snowflake #marshmallow, which quickly dissolves itself into the #drink, making it even more creamy. I hear this may already be off the menu in Bishop Arts but still at their McKinney location.

The edge of town, on the east side of the metroplex in #Rowlett; is a quaint new #Italian dig, with a laid-back rustic vibe, good food, & southern hospitality at its finest. I went for the 'Paesano', & was thrilled with the well-crafted creation- of a warm blend of fresh savory flavors by Chef Deno. Cavatelli style #pasta, mixed with chicken, broccoli, spinach, mushroom, with garlic, olive-oil, drizzled with a generous amount of parmesan. -IC

Tuesday craving: loaded #cheese #fries from the Skellig on Henderson.

My eyes bugged out, rolled back, and slowly closed when I took a bite of this Pecan Lodge #beef #rib. Every bite is its own #foodgasm, a record scratch in time that puts you into a transcendental state of bliss where all else becomes silent. These were the most amazing bites of #food I've eaten in a year‚Ä¶ except for the other times I've ordered this rib. Pecan Lodge is very consistent‚Äî no easy feat for #BBQ. This beef rib is smokey, salty, richly fatty, and has a texture contrast trifecta of crunchy crust, soft fats, and tender fibers of meat. Burnt Ends were a special this day and also extremely delicious, but the beef rib is always in its own class of phenom beyond words or photos. Let's just say these are the best bites of food in the northern half of #Texas!

The Marinated Jumbo Texas Shrimp with Spicy Cheese Grits at Julia Pearl did not disappoint. I did not expect the huge #shrimp that were cooked perfectly. The #grits were creamy with just the right amount of spice added from a smoked red pepper sauce. I really enjoyed the addition of the parsley oil and roasted broccoli - both made this dish feel special. -KH

Pan-seared #scallops with lemongrass #risotto was my favorite dinner entr√©e from BITE by Eddy T. Each "bite" of the deliciously seasoned scallops went well with the melt-in-your-mouth creamy risotto and #Parmesan cheese topping! I paired the dish with Shakespeare's Garden, a craft cocktail featuring #gin, #cucumber, and #dill. - SL

The Chicken Fried Flat Iron Steak @sissyssouthernkitchen is a for sure top favorite of mine for this traditional and classic dish. The flat iron steak is juicy and surrounded by a crispy and flaky layer of fried goodness. It comes with cream gravy which you can get on the side if you don't want the dish drenched in gravy. Try it with one of their signature cocktails. - AV

I can admit that Seoul Garden is not the typical restaurant I would see from the street and say - ‚ÄúOMG I have to stop!‚Äù - but the food, updated atmosphere and experience have made it one of my favorite #Korean restaurants in #Dallas. This is the lunch portion (yes, it‚Äôs huge) of their Bulgogi. It‚Äôs sliced marinated sirloin that literally melts in your mouth.  The bonus to Seoul Garden is that every meal is served with several sides of Korean favorites like #kimchi, spicy cucumbers and seaweed salad to name a few. -KH

This "Scrambler" from Dream Cafe is a great concept. The fluffy popover stuffed with scrambled #eggs, #goatcheese, sun-dried #tomatoes, and #spinach is a house favorite. The flavors were great although the eggs were scrambled a little too hard for my taste. It's worth noting that the service has been exceptional every time I've been to Dream Cafe (if you're lucky enough to get Kelsey she's attentive and knows the menu like the back of her hand!) -KH

When driving through #GlenRose, there is a #roadside #food that is as essential as kolache in West, #Texas: #friedPies. No one makes a #fried #pie quite like the shop inside the Exxon gas mart off Route 67. It's a large, completely self-contained #HandPie, and they deep fry the whole thing so the #pastry becomes ultra light, crispy, and buttery. Fruit, savory, and breakfast fillings are available. Grab a pint of ice cream from the convenient mart to make it a la mode.

This is so #good! The seasonal special at East Hampton Sandwich Co., The 'Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich' is one of the most finger-licking #FriedChickenSandwich's I've ever experienced. The #crispy tender chicken + the double sliced sharp cheddar, with fresh romain, thick crunchy pickles, & spicy thousand isle sauce make this a perfectly crafted homage to Chicken Fried Sandwiches from the #South. -IC

I can't rave enough about @clarkfoodandwineco everything I have had there has been great quality along with the top notch wine selections and clever craft cocktails. Their mac n cheese has a good balance of cheese where it isn't overpowering. It is also packed with #spicy #pork which gives it a great kick but doesn't leave your mouth on fire. It's topped with toasted bread crumbs for that crunchy pop. They have a great patio to enjoy the nice weather along with a brunch that I'm excited to try soon. - AV

I'm going traveling overseas, so be on the lookout for new posts on my @TheFoodieExplorer account! We have 5 contributors still in Dallas, plus I have a lot of old favorite and new #foods to share with you from when I was too busy to post in Dallas. For my last meal in Dallas, I got something I know I won't find overseas: one of the biggest and best chicken fried #steak dinners I've ever had! It's a tender piece of sirloin #beef with no grizzly parts, the coating is light and crisp, and the country gravy isn't studded with peppercorns. It sits atop green beans, which you can barely see for scale on the left. It's perfect! Another reason why The Porch has been my favorite restaurant in Dallas for at least two years.

Happy Chinese New Year! üêíüèÆüéâ Celebrating the #YearOfTheMonkey at one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants with a bit of my go to #ComfortFoods. I always enjoy the Spicy Dan Dan #Noodles & the Small Juicy Steamed #Dumplings. The peanuts drizzled over the noodles adds a satisfying crunch to the rather chewy dish, and the steamed #SoupDumplings are a party for the tastebuds, experiencing a warm burst of soup in your first bite of these delectable juicy dumplings. The authenticity and wholesomeness of these dishes satisfies even the most rapacious appetites when you're craving #ChineseFood in #Dallas! -IC #GungHayFatChoy #ChineseNewYear #LunarNewYear

üèàüçñ Looking for some good #barbecue to cater for #SB50? Look no further than 'Hard 8'. This #BBQ joint is one I could go back to time & time again & never get tired of. The #ribs are fall of the bone tender, the #brisket is succulent unlike any you've ever had, the #sausage has a spicy kick, & all their other #meats are all equally as delicious! -IC

I was impressed to see the #Kroger on Mockingbird Lane has a relatively robust #Texas #wine section that included #Tempranillo from Becker Vineyards. Texas Tempranillo was the big buzz several years ago at Grapefest in Grapevine. The wines were great, but I haven‚Äôt heard much about it since. This bottle was exactly what I remembered‚Äî a smooth, easy drinking wine with moderate body and moderate cherry flavors. I think of it as a toned-down version of a big Napa Valley Cabernet. Not watered down, but toned down. Most surprising to me is that the spicy "bite" that Spain has made synonymous with Tempranillo is not present in most Texas Tempranillos. As such, I found this to be a great pairing with Sissy‚Äôs Fried Chicken. #Takeout dinner doesn‚Äôt get more Texas gourmet than this!

Split up one rectangular styled #pizza from Stonedeck Pizza Pub and sampled the "Skinnie Minnie," "Bookemdanno," and "Meat and Meat with Meat." The Bookemdanno was my favorite with the well-blended flavors of roasted #pineapple, #ham, smoked #provolone served with a #marinara based sauce. Great spot to check out after a night out in Deep Ellum! - SL

The Tempura Fish #salad at #yucatantacostand is a favorite salad of mine from this gem on #Greenville The tempura fish is crispy on top of a mixed green salad medley. Some of the ingredients that make it pop are #chihuahuacheese #jicama cilantro, purple cabbage and queso fresco. Try it with their spicy buttermilk dressing but if you're wanting to save calories I like their balsamic vinaigrette. - AV

It looks like a hot dog with mustard, but it's not. It's the most beautifully made No. 16 #taco I've ever been served at Velvet Taco. That's yellow #curry mayo zigzagged on top beer battered cod #fish, covered in queso, in a lettuce wrap. It's a heavily modified order described in my early Jan. post of the same item, but it didn't look this good last time!

If you claim to be a #DallasBurgerLover, you've probably graced 'Off Site Kitchen' with your presence, if you haven't then you probably should. For lunch I opted for the Do It Murph-Style #burger, which captured the essence of what it means to be a burger unique to #Dallas, TX. This #MouthWatering juicy beef patty was delicately topped with a slice of american cheese, with jalape√±o & bacon relish nestled in-between for a kick, a slice of tomato, a handful of crisp lettuce, & a little bit of a that delicious secret sauce. A savory experience in every bite.- IC

The crispy #chicken #fried #steak from one of my favorite spots, Neighborhood Services in Addison, comes covered with a bacon #sage #gravy sprinkled with bite-sized pieces of #bacon and served on a heap of #buttermilk #mashed #potatoes. I have yet to order a dish that does not "wow" here!- SL

When you're eating this #cheesy #spaghetti with ground #bison meat added, you totally forget that you're actually eating #spaghettiSquash and not pasta noodles! This spaghetti is 100% #glutenFree #GF. The craft cocktails at True Food Kitchen were also outstanding. The Buffalo Trace Bourbon cherry drink with a Pinot Noir float was excellent with this meal. #DallasHealthyFood

#JedsGrill in #BishopArts is a bright new spot to this neighborhood. The owners are a mom and son team and are incredibly personable when I was there. It's an all American cuisine with a twist. I went there for #brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the elevated diner feel and they have amazing brunch drinks. The #HuevosRancheros started with crispy corn tortilla layers and black beans.  The 2 eggs are garnished with #quesofresco. I wanted a little something extra and asked for my dish to come with #chorizo which was a perfect extra touch. I love seeing family owned places that go the extra mile to get to know their customers and I am excited to go back for their #happyhour soon. - AV

Course 5/5: "Save the best for last" rang true for our fifth and final course at @Tw3ntys3v3n. For this #dessert, #blackberry #coulis (a fruit pur√©e) was drizzled over the creamy lemony goodness of a Meyer #Lemon #Tart, sat atop a scrumptiously crumbly crust, and accented with fresh #mint leaves. The unique #chili #whipped #cream topping added just a hint of spice to balance the sweetness. -SL. Pic by KH #MediaComp

Course 4/5: The Braised #Beef #Shortrib at @Tw3ntys3v3n was so incredibly tender and juicy, it melted in my mouth. The short rib lays on top of a creamy carrot #puree, which was velvety smooth. The pickled #cabbage gave it a tangy flavor, and the pistachios gave every bite an extra flavor pop. It is now one of my favorite short rib dishes. - AV. Pic by DG. #MediaComp

Course 3/5: When I asked Chef DAT's @Tw3ntys3v3n team about the inspiration for their White Cheddar #Grits, they said, "It's home (Louisiana) meets #tikkaMasala #curry." I literally could not get enough of this dish! The vegetables stewed in #Indian flavors married so well with the ultra creamy grits, crunchy pickled #okra, and pine nuts, that it was literally like a new flavor discovery in each bite. Several of us thought these were the best grits we've ever had! -KH #MediaComp

Course 2/5: We deemed the Roasted Root Salad at @tw3ntys3v3n a #Vegetarian‚Äôs dream dish because it was full of flavors you don‚Äôt normally get in a #vegetable dish. These flavors came from an unusual mix of root #veggies being tossed in a coriander lime vinaigrette and #harissa aioli. I've noticed Harissa is the new spice trend here. It is a very popular chili pepper paste from Africa, which it gave a bit of heat to play with the citrusy and earthy flavors. The root #vegetables were sliced into strings and cooked very al dente, some even still crunchy. -DG. Pic by AV #MediaComp

Course 1/5: The Dallas Foodie contributors tried @tw3ntys3v3n's 5-course tasting menu last night! We liked Twenty Seven's small, intimate atmosphere hiding behind a largely unmarked Deep Ellum facade. They have a seasonal-based menu of small plates, tasting menu, and craft cocktails. First course was this delicious Hawaiian Ahi #Tuna Poke served over avocado mousse with mango, wasabi peas, and #cilantro. This gave it many layers of flavor and a unique texture contrast from the crunchy wasabi peas. The avocado mousse is what really made this dish stand out to me. -LC. Pic by AV #MediaComp

So glad to find #Tacos la Banqueta is still making the best #streetTacos in Dallas. The tidbits of Saudero #beef were as moist and flavorful today as they were at my first bite, years ago. My favorite is still their #quesadilla because the only way to make a great #taco better is to melt #cheese inside of it! Two #quesadillas and a taco is $6.50, and a Topo Chico from the convenient gas mart mart next-door makes my ideal #Mexican meal.

Ramen has to be my favorite meal when it‚Äôs chilly outside and the Spicy Garlic Shrimp from the ‚ÄúSoupless Ramen‚Äù menu at Tanoshii Ramen never fails to deliver great flavor.  While ‚Äúspicy‚Äù is not how I would describe the #shrimp the #noodles are perfectly al dente with a chili soy sauce, a small amount of serrano peppers and topped with cilantro and scallions. I like to add a soft boiled #egg to give the dish a silky sauce. If you‚Äôre looking for strictly authentic #ramen this is not the spot for you, but if looking for good food that‚Äôs a great fusion of the #Japanese favorite this is a good option. -KH

I'm no stranger to the ever-popular #BobaTea, I can even brag and boast about the different blends & flavors, as well as bubble & jelly types I've sampled from all over the metroplex. I was absolutely surprised & excited to try an #Oreo milk flavored variant amongst all the traditional favorites. This delicious blended concoction of the age old #MilkAndCookies was so satisfying and paired together so naturally, it had me wondering why I myself never thought of having it as #BubbleTea before! -IC

There is nothing quite like a big bowl of homemade tortilla chips & #queso to get you through the week! My personal favorite is the #greenchile queso @torchystacos topped with #guacamole, queso fresco, cilantro, & diablo hot sauce.

Enjoyed this delicious & unique dish @boulevardieroc in @bishopartsdistrict for brunch today! Our waiter told us it was their most popular brunch dish. The "Legs & Eggs" comes with crisp duck leg confit w/ huckleberry preserves, sunny side up farm üç≥'s, & homestead stone-ground grit cakes. The duck was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I especially loved the preserves on top making it a sweet & savory dish.-LC

The #2 Original #Cheesesteak at Big Tony's West Philly Cheesesteaks is as authentic as it gets. "Big Tony" himself told me that it's the only place in #Dallas to get a true West Philadelphia favorite (cue The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song).

I am not always in the mood for duck but I am sure glad I ordered it at Filament. The #duck breast is juicy and tender and cooked to a perfect medium range. The #rice on the side was mixed with a tangy curry sauce and topped with thin shavings of pulled pork. They have a wide selection of specialty craft cocktails as well. This Deep Ellum spot is a great additional the area and I am excited to go back again.     - AV

#Oreo #Cheesecake at Grimaldi's is one of my favorite cheesecakes anywhere. It's really creamy, not sickly sweet, real #Oreos, and not doused in chocolate sauce. This means it tastes primarily like cheesecake, with Oreos, which is exactly how Oreo cheesecake should taste. üèÜ

I have been wanting to try #Starbucks' #wine, so when I drove by the striking glass architecture of a new Starbucks at Shops at Park Lane, I knew that had to be one of the 40 high-end locations that now sell wine, beer, and tapas (after 2pm). I was surprised to find a selection of established wineries, rather than a Starbucks brand. There's 1 sparkling, 4 white, 5 red. I was also surprised my #Malbec came nested with a glass dish of toasted pepitas. I like the etched fill line on the #stemless #Riedel glass, which says "permission to relax". My favorite part was just admiring the gorgeous, industrial loft chic #interiorDesign. Above my glass, you can see reclaimed wood boards hang from the ceiling, framing clusters of glass globes mixed with Edison filament bulbs.

Wayward Sons has been open for a month with Chef Graham Dodds' creative twists on farm-to-table ingredients so locally grown, they traveled all the way from the 8 large garden beds on the restaurant's patio! When I see a dish I've never seen before, I order it‚Ä¶ and that's how I learned why I've never seen #lamb in brisket form, despite spending four months of 2015 in two of the top lamb-producing countries of the world. Turns out lamb brisket is a bit tough, but flavorful and presumably Dodds made it as good as lamb brisket can get. But the buttermilk sweet potato #pie is so good, it could be on Emporium Pies' menu! The pie crust is amazingly crisp yet delicate, toffee brittle on top adds texture contrast, and the small grapefruit wedges add an unexpected citrus flavor to cut the sweet and savory flavors.

The #cheese üçü @katytrailicehouse are so good they should be illegal! They are covered with #bacon, jalape√±os, and green onions which makes them some of my favorite in town. Oh and we can't forget about the 2 sides of creamy ranch that comes with it!-LC

I usually don't drive out of Dallas to try restaurants, but Bavarian Grill in Plano is a #German dining experience unlike any I know of in Texas! They have so many √ºber kitschy German details in the staff attire, decor, music, and #food. A live accordionist played all night, and we heard 5 ringing cowbell renditions of the "Happy Birthday" song for ages 21 to 101‚Äî honestly a 101st birthday! My table started with possibly the best classic soft #pretzel in DFW‚Äî crusty outside and soft inside with two mustards and butter. I enjoyed a huge pretzel-crusted #schnitzel with #spaetzle and mixed veggies in brown "carroway" sauce, from which I 86ed the mushrooms. A 7-layer "Prinz Regenten Torte" #dessert sponge #cake with #chocolate shell tasted exactly like a fresh Hostess Ho-Ho üòç. Huge German beer and wine list too. Awesome place!

True to its description, the #Foundry #chicken finger #biscuit sandwich from Chicken Scratch required a fork & knife to maneuver. Mashed #potatoes, #smoked #bacon, American #cheese, and a drizzle of #honey stacked high on the extra #crisp chicken satisfied my craving for a slightly sweet but mostly savory #brunch entree. A side of refreshing cabbage and #vinegar #coleslaw provided a complementary contrast in both taste and texture to the dish. - SL

The lunch special at Toulouse yesterday was Pan Seared Scallops - um, so of course I ordered them! The #scallops were topped with a meyer lemon beurre blanc (a hot emulsified butter sauce). They were served with a #sweetpotato mousseline and caramelized #brusselsprouts saut√©ed with #bacon. Scallops are on the menu daily and I reached out to see if this special dish would be back anytime soon, while they couldn‚Äôt guarantee that it would they did say that chef often brings back favorites! -KH

The Porch Grilled Cheese is what I call the Perfect Grilled Cheese. It's my personal favorite #grilledcheese The Porch takes a classic sandwich and gives its own little twist. It has three kinds of delicious melted cheese: Gruyere, Tillamook Cheddar and Provolone. The taste of all three cheeses are balanced well with the sliced tomatoes. It's served with a roasted tomato soup on the side which is perfect to dunk the grilled cheese in.  - AV

I was in the mood for a dish outside of my comfort zone and chose the #Roasted #Duck Breast from Mot Hai Ba. The chef prepared the duck to an amazingly tender pink with flavor that was out of this world when combined with the roasted #mushrooms and #rice #porridge! Definitely will need to go back to try out the other rotational entrees! - SL

Six and a half years ago in Santiago, Chile, I toured Concha y Toro's Casillero del Diablo winery with a traveler from Montreal, Canada. I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from him since, but thanks to the magic of Facebook, he let me know he was in Dallas on business! He requested ribs for dinner. I told him what he really wants is to try some Texas #BBQ #brisket, and since Pecan Lodge closed at 3pm, we would meet at Lockhart Smokehouse. I ordered ‚Äúthe fattiest, juiciest, meat candy cut of brisket you have‚Äù; the pit master smiled and moved his knife from the sliced mid-section to an uncut section on the end. As Montreal ate his first-ever bite of succulent brisket, he proclaimed, ‚ÄúThis is so good it should be illegal.‚Äù Then we went to Emporium Pies, and his skinny, non-sweets-eating French physique ate a huge slice of warm, good ole American apple pie. Not a bad way to spend your only dinner out in Dallas!

Cool weather calls for warm #sushi (and sake) like the Baked Salmon Roll at Fujiyama. Yes, baked salmon rolls are on the menu at most sushi bars in #Dallas, but the one here seems special to me. It's a California roll filled with a crab salad that's not overdressed in mayo - it's topped with #salmon, #avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce and crunchy #almonds that give a unique texture. The entire roll is baked and served warm. Perfect comfort food that's not very heavy. -KH

Taking advantage of this beautiful patio weather at Flying Saucer on the Lake! The Philly Cheesesteak I ordered has a comforting warmth from the melted cheese and juicy grilled onions that all hold together well in a crisp toasted bun, served with seasoned fries. The weekend doesn't seem so far anymore. - IC

In my mind when #goodmorning was first said they were thinking of the Nutella Strawberry Croissant Donut at Jarams. The sweet/tangy #strawberries, and sticky #Nutella, on top of a #cronut that's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside is what good mornings are made of! -KH

I think The Theodore may be the best #restaurant in Dallas right now! I've been thoroughly impressed by the flavors and creativity of the #food all four times I've visited since it opened, not even 2 months ago. One such dish is this tender, bone-in #lamb shank wrapped with pastry to create what tastes like one of the best meat pies you've ever eaten. Chicken Thighs app. with mustard dipping sauce were somehow even tastier, with crispy skin and rich fat flavors. Roasted Pheasant Salad has a flavor complexity ranging from citrus grapefruit, to duck fat croutons, to a sprinkling of cardamom powder. Desserts are also really creative, craft cocktails are quality, and the happy hour has both early and late hours. All around awesome.

Instead of a typical #brunch a friend and I brunched on #pie today at Emporium Pies. The Snowball starts with toasted coconut (great texture) on top of airy #whippedcream and smooth #coconut custard in a perfect flaky crust. It is a stellar choice for those who love coconut like me plus it's worth noting that my friend, who is not a coconut fan, enjoyed it too. This is on their seasonal menu so get a slice while you can! -KH

Being a #Dallas Burger Lover, I try to keep myself up-to-date with the many options my city has to offer. Today I was in the mood for a #fresh, unique, & flavorful kick, so I bucked on down to @rodeogoatdallas, & went with the mouth-watering & delicious sounding 'Brad Sham' #burger; topped with sweet applewood smoked bacon, crisp fried onions, pickled chutney, home made bbq sauce, and just the right amount of jalape√±os. Better tasting than it even sounds. -IC

#PecanLodge really knows how to #bbq I tried the 2 meat plate with my favorite juicy #brisket and tender #pulledpork I should have eaten the meat plain since it's so flavorful by itself. But the bbq sauce gave it a sweet tang which I loved. A barbecue meal isn't the same without amazing sides, I got the #bacon mac and cheese and the fried #okra it's one of my favorite barbecue meals! - AV

#GrubBurger offers my favorite #veggieburger. I am not a #vegetarian but I just can't get enough of this #chickpea and #eggplant burger. I like to get my burgers with no bun to save calories. The patty is juicy and incredibly flavorful. It tastes like something you would get at a Greek restaurant. It's topped with goat cheese and #tabbouleh for an even more unique taste. - AV #dallashealthyfood

Create your own bowl of healthy greens or opt for a signature #salad like I did with the #Greenville #Cobb from Crisp Salad Company. To make my lunch healthier, I asked for no bacon and light dressing but kept the rest of the fresh ingredients like chopped boiled #egg, grape #tomatoes, #avocado, and #romaine greens topped with a Dijon #vinaigrette! - SL #DallasHealthyFood

Dining out #healthy #lowcarb for #brunch can be difficult because #breakfast revolves around starch: potatoes, toast, or flour pancakes. The trick is to order an #egg dish and know which restaurants let you substitute potatoes and bread for a salad or fruit, without an up-charge. At Bread Winners, you can order anything in the ‚ÄúScrambles‚Äù section and sub potatoes for a mostly ripe side of mixed #fruit. They also will sub egg whites or egg beaters at no extra charge. I like the Migas (hold the chips) and "Leo's Favorite", which is grilled ham, herb chicken, caramelized onions, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, and hollandaise. Far from boring scrambled eggs! #DallasHealthyFood

I bet you didn't think the No. 16 Fish N Chips #taco at Velvet Taco was a #lowcarb #food qualifying for our #DallasHealthyFood week. With French fries and battered #fish cradled by a flour or corn tortilla, this is one of their carbiest tacos! But Velvet Taco has a largely unpublicized option to put ANY taco into a #lettuceWrap at no extra charge, so there goes the tortilla carbs! I think the added lettuce greatly improves this taco by balancing the fried fish flavor with a fresh flavor. Now what about the malted french fries that make it ‚Äúfish and chips"? I sub those for white queso, which is also no extra charge and makes the whole taco as delicious as every other Tex-Mex food drizzled with melted cheese. It also helps that the fish itself is lightly battered, flakey, moist, and covered in a flavorful yellow curry mayo. The only carbs left are in the batter, making this one of my favorite tacos on their menu! Also #pescatarian.

If you‚Äôre craving #sushi, but need to eat #lowcarb or #SouthBeachDiet, then you‚Äôve got to get it without the rice. I have ordered no rice with ahi tuna towers in several Dallas restaurants, and it always turns out delicious. The Blue Fish makes this extra easy by putting this riceless ‚ÄúSoBe‚Äù #sushiroll right on the menu. It‚Äôs a trio of salmon, shrimp, crabstick, and masago wrapped in #cucumber and beautifully plated. It‚Äôs served with a vinaigrette on the plate, but I still use soy.

This Bison Quinoa Hash is a #glutenfree, #carbconscious, #sodiumconscious meal from Snap Kitchen. It's reminiscent of #chili on top of rice with a slight crunch. The meal is seasoned perfectly and full of grass-fed #bison, red #quinoa, kidney #beans, brown rice, onions, red peppers and topped with a little reduced fat sharp cheddar. Delicious choice for a healthy meal that may work for your parameters to eat healthier in 2016! -KH #DallasHealthyFood

Who's ready to #eat healthier in 2016? We want to show that you can dine out in #Dallas and still eat delicious, #healthy #food! For the next week, we'll be posting healthy restaurant foods using #DallasHealthyFood. "Healthy" has a variety of definitions depending on your #diet, so we'll try to cover a variety and hashtag related diets as best we can. This #lowcarb, #paleo, #pescatarian dish at HG Sply Co used #zucchini strings in place of pasta, and I chose grilled #salmon as the protein. To make it low carb, I removed the toasted hemp-oat topping. HG makes it really easy to customize a base vegetable or grain mix with a protein topper in a bowl, so it's a great healthy choice restaurant.

New Years resolutions are right around the corner.. so before the diets commence, I suggest warming yourself up with a hearty ribeye #cheesesteak, piled (grilled onions, grilled peppers, mushrooms, jalape√±os), & smothered with #cheesewhiz. It's a great way to keep you warm, cozy, & satisfied while you rethink those "resolutions". -IC

Sometimes I just want good old fashioned #nachos. Today I had Picadillo Style Nachos from La Comida Mexican Kitchen. All of the ingredients were very fresh but I did feel the meat was underseasoned.  The pico de gallo that the nachos are served with was simple and delicious - the tomatoes added the perfect crunch along with chunky #guacamole. ‚ÄìKH

I had family in town and had to take them for some fried #chicken at Ida Claire. The Chicken in a Biscuit was so flavorful. The biscuit was flaky and the chicken that laid on top was incredibly crispy and juicy. The sunny side up #egg added a good texture to the hearty chicken. I thought it's a great dish for a play on breakfast for dinner. I am very surprised this dish isn't on their brunch menu. - AV

Homemade #Christmas #eggnog in three different flavors! My cousin starts these on Thanksgiving and lets the flavors mellow for a month. The maple/ brandy/ bourbon version is perfect for dipping their maple bacon cookies. Even my grandma, who I've seen sip alcohol maybe three times in my life, chugged the amaretto version in two sips, declared it "delicious" and asked for a roadie to take back to her assisted living home!

I never thought I would be eating ice cream right before Christmas but it sure feels like summer outside! I jumped at the chance to try this new spot #motorsisters located right in front of the Truck Yard. I liked the old fashioned concept of ordering from a walk up window. They have 3 choices of soft serve either chocolate, vanilla or swirl. The swirl was so creamy and not too sweet. They have lots of mix in options, sundaes and shakes. - AV

I have family in town for the #holidays and want to show them some #Texas cuisine at one of my favorite restaurants - Neighborhood Services. I always start with Grilled Avocado.

When I asked the barista at Cultivar what he suggested he asked me if I wanted #coffee or #tea, sweet or unsweetened, sugar or honey...after I told him my choices he brought me a Local Honey and it was exactly what I needed.

First time in all my world travels I've found a restaurant that has figured out not just how to make tasty, hot #breakfast #food at an airport, but to do it in just 3 minutes to-go. Blue Mesa at DFW Terminal E has a #takeout line where you get to pick #migas, breakfast tacos, or a breakfast burrito, then pick your toppings. They scoop your custom order into a takeout container right in front of you, then you're on your way. And you can create it with no carbs, which is nearly impossible to find at an airport. The scrambled #eggs don't even look sketchy in the closeup.

Traditional & Authentic Vietnamese #Pho from Pho Truong is my go-to whenever the weather seems to cool down, and I'm in need of something #warm & #delicious.

For six months I‚Äôve searched every #Japanese restaurant menu I've passed in three different countries for the best #food I ate in Japan, #tuna #toro #sushi. Today on the specials menu at Teppo in Dallas I found not regular toro, but the BETTER version, the king of all sushi‚Äî ‚ÄúSuper Toro", or "O-toro" as menus say in Japan. Look on the right, how it practically falls apart in chunks because the fat ribbons are so tender! Two pieces of "Blue Fin Tuna Super Toro‚Äù sushi were $15. For comparison, I had these two pieces in a popular chain restaurant in Japan as part of a tasting platter with many other grades and styles of tuna for $24 USD for the whole platter! (See top right: https://instagram.com/p/5LkiPYvZ9X.) Teppo's pieces were not as fresh, flavorful, tender, or bright pink as this chain restaurant, but it's still better to eat super toro again than to have another sushi waiter tell me they‚Äôve never heard of ‚Äútoro‚Äù. Also, Teppo‚Äôs #yakitori (grilled stuff on skewers, pictured in background) were as flavorful as ones I ate in Japan.

Never know what I'm going to find on the specials board at Dive Coastal, but it's usually delicious, like this juicy, pan-seared rainbow trout #fish with two sides. I love unique side dish options, and they had more than one: spaghetti squash with leeks (mild onions), and yellow and green squash with ground chorizo. I order spaghetti squash wherever I see it, and this is the best tasting version I've found this season.

When the waiter at Taco Deli brought out the #TacooftheMonth - the Chile en Nogada #Taco - he said it was a "celebration of life" and it lived up to his proclamation!

[Post 4/4] Was blown away to find two pieces of whole #lobster claw meat inside the Honey Butter Maine Lobster Fritters at @TJsSeafood #brunch. To think I almost didn't order this phenomenal meal because I feared a heavy fritter; that fritter literally melts in your mouth in a way that defies the physics of carbs! Honey butter in a #fritter is just the perfect evolution of lobster and butter for brunch. #MediaComp

The hickory salmon was flavorful and topped with a sunny side #egg the breakfast #potatoes balanced the salmon and the egg to make a delicious bite. - AV #mediacomp @tjsseafood

[Post 1/4] This is the Strait Lane at @TJsSeafood. The truffled scrambled eggs are light, fluffy and the earthiness of the #truffle shines through. In the middle is a "pullman toast" (a light airy toasted white bread) round that's buttered and topped with micro greens, cr√®me fra√Æche plus caviar - the smooth cr√®me fra√Æche makes the dish light and come together. It's an amazing #brunch dish that I haven't seen in #Dallas! -KH #mediacomp

I am missing the uptown location of Nick and Sam's so I satisfied my craving at the Preston location. ABC #sramble is made up of fluffy scrambled #eggs, melted cheddar #cheese and sliced #avocado for a lighter taste. It comes with a side of breakfast potatoes which were a tad greasy but it was well seasoned. Try it with a carafe of pineapple mimosa! - AV

This is a phenomenal #cheesy baked side dish, and it is not mac n #cheese! It's actually better than most mac. Under that bubbling layer of Brie are chunks of tender, roasted pear and roasted butternut squash lightly dressed in b√©chamel and sprinkled with #bacon crumbles and scallions. üòç The only negative is that this $12 dish isn't larger, but it's still a must-try at Stock & Barrel.

When Pecan Lodge gives you #burntEnds, your taste buds party like it's 1999! "Fatty brisket" is not on their menu, but every time I order it, they nod, push a button on the register, and I get the most amazing #brisket in Dallas. #SecretMenu?! Discovered the most worthy side dish for this spectacular #BBQ is the #collardGreens with bacon; it has a sweet and spicy kick that makes them one of the few cooked greens I've actually enjoyed eating. I missed #TexasBBQ while overseas, but the other item in this pic was my most missed‚Äî fresh brewed iced tea! I got puzzled looks wherever I asked, and a few overseas servers replied, "Well I could put ice in hot tea." NO.

Was really impressed by everything at The Theodore just one week after they opened in Northpark mall. First, the painted astrological ceiling inside one of the booths is one of the most gorgeous works of ceiling art I've seen anywhere in the world. The cocktails are just as balanced and creative as Bolsa because their former barman, Kyle Hilla, crafted this menu. Housemade Corned Beef Brisket sandwich is good enough to satisfy a New York deli craving. Crab Apple Toffee Cake (pictured) is too small for $9, but a creative and tasty variation on a classic toffee cake. I'll be back soon!

The Meat & #Cheeseboard at The Blind Butcher is one of the best in Dallas! It's a cornucopia of delicious, unusual housemade #meats and local #cheese collaborations. #Duck #pastrami was my favorite meat for its moist, savory bits. Goat cheese was my fav cheese because it was really creamy but had the light texture of whipped butter. Housemade pickled #veggies featured two or three different pickling flavors. Also had rabbit terrine, loaf of speck?, beef slices, portobello steak, sausage, whole grain mustard, hickory smoked blue cheese, white wine washed cheese, seed lavosh, oil toasted crostini, and a lightly pickled boiled chicken egg. #IndefiniteCheeseboards

Does it bother you that a lifesaving organization, #CarterBloodCare, is giving out holiday gift certificates for a product whose manufacturer knowingly allowed to kill its customers less than a year ago? If someone you knew had died in this way, would you ever buy that company's products again? Before you comment, please read the Houston Chronicle‚Äôs in-depth investigation with stories from employees who were there‚Äî http://bit.ly/1OTKQoF.

Starting the week off with the decadent smoked ham mac & cheese casserole @porchrestaurant! This dish has been a staple on the menu since 2007. It's defiantly 1 of the best #macandcheese dishes in DFW. It consists of over 5 different #cheeses which gives it a rich and delicious flavor.-LC

OMG, this is the most beautiful and delicious #FrenchToast I've ever eaten! The housemade bread has the texture of a perfectly cooked churro‚Äî lightly crisp on the outside but soft and warm on the inside. It's sprinkled with cinnamon, honey, orange blossom water, and layered with mascarpone; 100% worth breaking a diet for! And the #mimosas are made with house-pur√©ed guava, orange, apricot, or pomegranate for just $1. But there is something massively wrong with this scene‚Ä¶ the chairs are all empty! I am baffled how this amazing brunch is empty, while across the street there's a wait to get a table at Public School. And this meal, menu, and interior design is so much better than anything on the $41 brunch buffet I ate at Neiman's yesterday, and that is booked until January! Everything you see here was just $13. Dog friendly patio too. Seriously, why aren't you having brunch at Baboush?!

Chashu buns at Ramen Hakata are described as steamed buns filled with grilled pork belly served with a spicy sauce. The #porkbelly is everything #foodies love but instead of being a thick slice of meat it‚Äôs shredded making the melt in your mouth delicacy easier to bite in the soft steamed buns. The meat is covered in what they described as a spicy sauce that‚Äôs more like a tangy sweet barbecue sauce and a light mayo. It‚Äôs worth noting that the service at Ramen Hakata is great. For first timers they take time to describe each menu item to find the perfect dish for your taste. Wonderful option if looking for a new weekend #brunch spot! -KH

Finally tried the flagship Neiman Marcus' The Zodiac Restaurant holiday #brunch #buffet, now in its 20th year! They start everyone with chicken broth consume with a micro cheese biscuit and a large popover with strawberry butter. The buffet is a long table of salads and a long table of entrees and sides, plus a tray of bite size desserts for your table. It is better than an average buffet, but I didn't see a quality or quantity that fully justified its $41 food cost (even non-alcoholic drinks were not included). Tastiest items were: triple mac n cheese, potato latkes with sour cream and apple pie filling, wood grilled asparagus salad, and baked salmon.

The #serrano cream sauce that covered the Pollo Serrano #enchiladas from Meso Maya was flavorful with just a hint of spice, so I asked for a side of chopped fresh #jalapenos to kick it up another notch. I was also a huge fan of the white corn tortillas and the "chihuahua and asadero cheese cilantro" topping! - SL

Densetsu is just one of the many great #sushi restaurants in #DFW; what makes them stand out amongst the rest is the generous portions of their rolls. Pictured here is one of the biggest, & one my favorites- The #GodzillaRoll, which graciously lives up to its name. This soft shell crab meat roll is topped with spicy tuna & a hint of avocado, which is then topped with a hearty amount of crunchy tempura crumbs, and green caviar. I have yet to find a #big yet tasteful #sushiroll anywhere else around the metroplex. -IC

In love with all things #Cajun; so when I heard about a little piece of NOLA here in the metroplex, I had to see what it was all about. #WickedPoboys did a great job of capturing just what I wanted with their "extra wicked"- #gumbo & fried shrimp, & the blackened #shrimp #poboy's! Not to mention the beignets for dessert, not quite up to par with Cafe Du Monde, but a nice try. Will definitely be back to try more! -IC

Case of the Mondays disappeared as soon I took a bite of these cheesy and delicious #enchiladas at Manny's! Pictured is the #cheese and sour cream enchiladas. Manny's is a casual Tex-Mex restaurant with a fun atmosphere serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour! -LC

Met a friend for #lunch in #Frisco at Bonnie Ruth's Caf√© earlier this week. It's a very cute French caf√© apparently known for its #brunch buffet on the weekends. The waiter said they're also known for their Chicken Paillard, and it was very buttery, tender, and delicious. My friend raved about their #dessert #crepes, but we found out they don't make them outside of the weekend buffet. Turned out they had some extra boysenberry sauce and blueberries, so they whipped up some crepes for us with sweet cream cheese filling! They were the most light and delicious crepe shells I've had in a restaurant outside of France! Best crepes in DFW.

My #Thanksgiving specialty is a Cheesy Smashed #Cauliflower recipe I've developed over many years. It's a great #lowCarb mashed potato substitute. I make it slightly different every year. First you boil cauliflower and mix until it looks like mashed potatoes (left). Then add a container of softened Anduele cheese, and a trio of freshly shredded cheese (ex. Gruyere, Parmesan, Munster). At the end I broil more shredded cheese on top (right). What's your Thanksgiving specialty?

I made Cranberry Apple Onion Chutney for my first time ever cooking with #cranberries or making chutney earlier this month. It turned out great! I had some fresh cranberries leftover, so I twisted the recipe into a #homemade #Cranberry #Apple Sauce for #Thanksgiving. The sweetness of a Granny Smith apple and hand-squeezed fresh clementines, plus heavy dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves add enough flavor and sweetness that you don‚Äôt really need to add sugar. It smells like a cranberry Christmas candle while it simmers! So easy, quick, and delicious to make; I don‚Äôt know why anyone would buy canned #cranberrySauce! What do you prefer in your cranberry sauce?

I learned from #ThanksgivingwithWhiteFamilies and #ThanksgivingwithBlackFamilies that there's a massive stereotype that white people don't season their #Thanksgiving #turkey and don‚Äôt know how to make baked #macncheese from scratch. Having eaten the past ten years of Thanksgivings in different white, black, hispanic, and even Jewish homes that year Hanukkah fell on Thanksgiving, I admit I have seen these stereotype foods, but luckily not very often. IMO, the worst is the person who brings a pre-made item from the grocery store. There‚Äôs always one no matter what race you‚Äôre eating with! At least if they made Kraft, they attempted to make something! Now I hope I didn't just offend someone I'm eating with tomorrow!

I can't think of a better way to enjoy a cool day than with a hot cup of coffee from #Houndstooth. The baristas take extra time in doing creative #latte #art. The espresso was smooth and not too acidic. I have returned multiple times, and the taste is consistent with each visit. - AV

Always in search of a good #crepe, I tried Whisk Crepes Cafe in Oak Cliff. A savory crepe with cheese and egg was heavy on the buckwheat, and the egg wasn't a sunny-side up fried egg, as Parisian #crepes have led me to expect. The Poached Pear Crepe (pictured) was really good with candied ginger on whipped cream and housemade #caramel sauce. The only semi-disappointing part was the pear itself; it had a sort of bitter flavor rather than flavors of cinnamon, pear, or sweetness. You can create your own sweet or savory crepe, so I highly recommend this one without the pears!

While enjoying a big bowl of Terilli's #LobsterBisque, I decided it needed a white wine pairing. The bartender had a recommendation before I even finished the question: Whitehaven Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand. It was an exemplar #food and wine pairing! The crisp, clean acidity of the wine cut the buttery, rich soup, resulting in a flavor balance combination that was greater than its parts. I then paired it with their marina #mussels, where this wine perfectly substituted and improved upon the flavor purpose of the provided lemon wedge. Coincidently, I rode past this winery on a bicycle wine tour earlier this year! It's the best Sauv Blanc appellation in the world!

Ordered my personal favorite from @terillis on Greenville, #Penne with Grilled Chicken. The chicken is always tender and juicy while the sun-dried tomatoes, #artichoke hearts, and roasted #garlic cloves add bursts of flavor with every bite! I particularly enjoy the fact that this dish isn't served with a heavy cream or marinara sauce but rather with a #spicy garlic #olive #oil. - SL

Was looking for a custom #sushi party platter, and the Internet pointed me to a small #HoleintheWall #Japanese grocer and sushi bar, Kazy Gourmet, in the almost-Richardson part of Dallas. I also ordered some for myself to eat now. It is the definition of basic: you get a Turn-o-Matic number, like at a grocery store deli counter, and a cafeteria tray. 75-cent #misoSoup in styrofoam cup was as good as the good ones I had in Japan. The sushi was all basic‚Äî good but not great. Lots of Japanese serving ware, candies, and sauces for sale, too.

Sometimes you don't truly appreciate something until you don't have it anymore. I'm not talking about an ex; I'm talking about the #PorkChop at Perry's Steakhouse! When I travel, I'm reminded how no #pork dish comes even close to being this delicious and moist. At #lunch on #Fridays, this normally $37.95 entree is only $13.95, with a side of fancy swirled mashed potatoes included. I'm sure the huge volume they cook during this lunch has something to do with why every one is not perfectly cooked‚Äî if you look close you can see this one had some dry areas‚Äî but they will quickly replace a subpar one if you ask. It's probably the best #food #discount in #DFW. They say this is a "lunch cut" portion, but it's still so large it's hard to finish in one sitting.

The title of Most Insanely #Cheesy #Pasta I‚Äôve ever eaten is no longer held by Plano's Holy Grail Pub Mac N Cheese. They are now second to this awesome little Italian joint, whose location I just revealed in the last two posts on my @TheFoodieExplorer account‚Ä¶

It's very rare when you find a true #cocktail and #food pairing, but when I told bartender Grant at Hibiscus that my rich, sweet glazed ribs could use "something like an Old Fashioned", he 100% agreed and delivered an Old Fashioned with a lot of lemon to cut the sweet glaze. It was a genius pairing. I also had an excellent cured #salmon board with purple onion, curly greens that tasted soaked in a salt brine, dehydrated capers that lost their salt, really good creme fraiche, cauliflower pur√©e that tasted fermented (not good), and sesame Asiago lavash to put it on. Also started out with a great two-flavor cocktail‚Äî a dry Malbec float over a sweet concoction (pictured)

I was In the mood for southern comfort food so I tried #idaclaire #chicken and #waffles. The chicken is crispy and juicy and on the bone. The chicken lays on top of a #savory  corn meal waffle. It comes with hot sauce butter which was a bit spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of the hot sauce butter because of the heat. Overall it was a good blend of savory and sweet. I paired it with one of their signature craft cocktails the Ida Claire gimlet -AV

Rapscallion was one of the new restaurants I was most looking forward to trying after four months away from Dallas, and I was not disappointed. Their signature rotisserie #chicken had the flavor and texture of delicious smoked chicken or sometimes even the flavor of Polish sausage. Even moreso, I enjoyed their grilled "Cauliflower Steaks", with a tangy, creamy dressing; wilted herbs; and pickled onions. Craft cocktail menu also looks on par with others in Dallas; the seasonal "Town & Country" cocktail was a slight twist on an Old Fashioned.

London #Steak #Frites from Neighborhood Services was cooked to a tender medium (exactly as I ordered) and seasoned just the right amount to not need the additional "Voodoo Peppercorn Sauce." The steak was delicious on its own. The thin and crispy #fries completed this seemingly simple and classic yet mouthwatering entree! - SL

These are the first #DeviledEggs I ever liked, and they are still my favorite deviled #eggs. Sissy's liberal use of curry seasoning and the salty pops of tobiko #caviar cut down the yolky flavor that standard deviled eggs have and elevate a simple #egg into something very delicious.

Hilariously awesome! A "Progressive Feminist Dinner for 4‚Äù with D Magazine's and Dallas Observer‚Äôs female food critics includes an evening that "starts at Hooters, hits Twin Peaks and Tallywackers, and ends with lap dances and fine food at The Lodge [a strip club]. The package sold for $6,900,‚Äù reports Nancy Nichols, D Magazine‚Äôs food editor. Looks like she and Alice climbed an invisible stripper pole on the Meat Fight stage to help sell this auction dinner and raise money for the National MS Society!

Gloomy days make me crave comforting pub food. The #fishnchips @oldmonkdallas are the "best in town" according to @d_magazine and my personal favorite. Atlantic cod in a Smithwicks batter served pub style with steak cut fries, malt vinegar, and #homemade tartar sauce. Goes perfectly with a @stellaartois!-LC

The most disappointing, expensive meal I've ever eaten was my first visit to Uchi Dallas, this past week. Conversely, years ago, their Austin location made the 2nd best tasting and 1st most expensive meal I'd ever bought myself. Almost every single bite of Austin's 6-course Omakase chef's tasting menu had my tastebuds screaming ‚ÄúWOW". But the Omakase meal in Dallas was best summed up by my foodie friend who tasted every course with me as, ‚ÄúYeah, that sushi roll tastes like ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô‚Äù generic roll you can get anywhere. When pork belly is served in a $98 tasting menu, that meat better not have an ounce of dryness in it. As you can see in my photo, every pre-cut bite was half dry meat and half semi-moist fat. Only one course, the Walu Walu (bottom left), and the dessert (bottom right) were "pretty good‚Äù; the rest ranged from ‚Äúgood" to ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm paying more than $30 for this". Two of the platings were visually unique and beautiful; for $98 all six courses should have been beautiful. On the extremely rare occasion when I pay over $35 for any meal‚Äî let alone close to $100‚Äî I expect to be wowed at least once, and to never be served dry pork!

Now THIS is the best #ChickenNWaffles in Dallas! It's easy to explain why no other #chicken and #waffles is even on the same level of deliciousness‚Äî Bread Winners has created a quadfecta of core tastes: sweet, salt, savory, and spicy. Most CnW only have two tastes: sweet (maple syrup) and savory (chicken and waffle). BW starts with the basic, yet elusive combo of a perfect amount of moist, boneless chicken and a perfect waffle that is lightly crispy on the outside but soft inside. Then they add pops of salt with so many chunks of bacon inside the waffle you can actually see them in the photo! They've also added multiple hints of light, spicy flavors with minced jalape√±o inside the waffle and their own hot sauce drizzled on top. So you get syrup, cream gravy, and hot sauce on a jalape√±o bacon cheddar waffle with moist chicken. There's no room for improvement! TIP: order it with all toppings on the side, so you can play with the flavor balance of each bite, as shown here.

Finally made it to Whiskey Cake for their famous #ChickenNWaffles at #brunch. The best part was actually the two farm-fresh-tasting, #sunnysideup #eggs sourced from Prosper, TX. They still needed at least a dash of salt and pepper, which were annoyingly not on my table and the waitress was never in sight. I was surprised this didn't come with maple syrup, which turned out to be the second best item. It's real maple, served warm, so good. The slightly soggy #waffle was partially redeemed by salty bacon chunks inside (and the syrup). There was so little sausage gravy on mine, it might as well not been included, especially since its only contributing flavor was fennel seed, which I personally hate and didn't expect to find in CnW. Chicken was good and tender, but there was only enough chicken for half the waffle. Luckily, delicious eggs covered the other half. Maybe I was served a rushed version, but I won't be rushing back to Plano to confirm that.

The most delicious blob in Dallas: Cloud Nine #Pie at Emporium Pies. The buttery #piecrust always reminds me of my mom's Christmas cookies. The butterscotch and meringue fillings are sweet but light. This is one of Dallas' favorite #foods, and I could find nothing remotely like it in my travels this year. It usually goes off the menu soon and won't be back until spring!

Hello, Stodg. I missed you. I may have cheated on you in New Zealand with other grassfed #beef #burgers with a fried #egg on top, but I was always thinking of you. Somehow your beef is more flavorful, your bacon is better, the others didn't use Tillamook cheddar, and they didn't come on a buttered, toasted egg bun like you do. If only you weren't served on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce, you would be my second or third favorite burger in the world. Love, The Original Dallas Foodie. @ The Porch Restaurant in Dallas

Sure to satisfy cravings for warm broth dishes this fall, the #Chiang #Mai Noodles Kao Soi from Malai Kitchen features a rich curried #coconut broth, #broccoli, chicken, egg #noodles, and #bok #choy!

Being back in Dallas means another installment of #IndefiniteCheeseboards Monday! Tonight I got to try one of the first boards our group reviewed 73 weeks ago‚Äî Tiziki‚Äôs #Greek #cheeseboard. Several in our group still rank it amongst the best of the 17+ Dallas #cheeseboards we‚Äôve reviewed on this hashtag in the 93 weeks since it started. Now I see why‚Ä¶ It has unique inclusions, such as grape leaf wrapped Dolmades, pureed artichoke dip, herbed pitas, ‚Äúgin & juice lamb salamis‚Äù, and drizzles of olive oil on the #cheeses. I‚Äôm a bit confused why they used a French #feta instead of a Greek feta, but the feta and #manchego were good. Overall, not my favorite board because of the somewhat bland #cheese selections, but an excellent variety of foods.

The original Dallas Foodie is back in Dallas after four months traveling overseas! I still have much travel #food and scenery to share on my @thefoodieexplorer account, and contributors will continue posting here, but I just found a "WTF" Weekly #Taco Feature worth trying at Velvet Taco. It's slightly crispy, moist grilled #salmon with crema, a hint of Thai #Basil, a hint of red pepper spice, and a really delicious, fresh, vibrant purple, hibiscus corn #tortilla. I missed good #tacos!

Looking for a great #Sunday #brunch? Try #chilaquiles with #chorizo  Crispy tortilla chips with a good balance of scrambled eggs, flavorful chorizo and a mix of color with red peppers, onions and cilantro. Pair it with a mimosa or Bloody Mary and you are golden to start your Sunday off right. - AV

When it comes to authentic Chinese #DimSum, there're two places that have created a name for themselves in the metroplex; #JSChen is one of them. Pictured here is the steamed bbq pork bun, which consists of just the right amount of sweet & tangy #bbq sauce over pork, wrapped in a soft chewy bun steamed to perfection. There's a huge variety of delicious dim sum served in filling portions, everyday from opening until 3pm. -IC

Thanks to @GuideLive for featuring us as one of 7 Instagram accounts #DFW #foodies should follow ‚Äî http://ow.ly/Ullij. Special thanks for also recognizing that we have ten awesome contributors in DFW while the original #DallasFoodie account creator posts #food she discovers while traveling the world as @TheFoodieExplorer. Now please enjoy this unposted photo of the amazing Hickory Smoked #Salmon Board I had at TJ Seafood‚Äôs right before I started traveling in July. There were so many flavors in this, I craved this dish for two weeks after I ate it! It‚Äôs right up there with the best #cheeseboard or #charcuterie boards I‚Äôve ever eaten, even though fish is neither of those.

It's almost lunchtime and I'm craving one of my favorite #sandwiches in town! The #friedchicken + jack @easthamptonsandwich is stacked up high with southern fried chicken, pepper jack #cheese, greens, tomato, cured #bacon, #avacodo mash, and jalape√±o cream sauce. It has all the right elements to make this sandwich a standout, bursting with flavor! -LC #nomoredelimeat
