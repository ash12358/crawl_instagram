Today’s is the official end of my school year teaching PreK, Kindergarten and 5th grade students... I frickin’ adore these kids with all I’ve got! Such wonderful graduation ceremonies this week, and the kids really nailed their songs and had a great time. Chills, tears and many hugs shared. It sounds like they want me to come back next year, which would be an honor. I was seriously blessed to work with such loving and open kids at this school. Learned a lot as a teaching artist to boot... Farewell for the summer, friends! #proudteacher #graduation #lastdayofschool #teacherlife🍎 #teachingartist #musicmatters #singasong🎤🎶 #worldsgreatest #thisisme #whatiam

Lovely gifts for the last day at my Bronx school alongside my new wall of artwork from my students at said school...

Teaching buddies! Through thick and thin—we made it. So proud of our kids’ work in their “BUILD” musical show! So much love to this woman... @terrylecompte is the absolute best person to have taught alongside as I started my teaching journey. Wonderful woman, compassionate teacher and takes no BS, from no one! Thanks for all you’ve done and all you’ve taught me in our two springs of doing this program! #teacherlife🍎 #teacherappreciation #partners #musicaltheatre #build #soproud #thankful #closingshow

THIS is who I got to be: Classic Wonder Woman! It was a kids day camp yesterday, and I can’t tell you how fun it was asking the kids questions with the lasso of truth and battling off the forces of evil with my magic wristbands. First time doing a dress-up walk-around like this, but I loved it!

Grateful for the cloud cover making the eclipse bearable to see with the naked eye! Also grateful for the family next to me who let me take a look through their eclipse glasses for a second... hehe. The unconscious coming forward, eclipsing the ego and outward. Feminine eclipsing the masculine. Where there is light, there is a shadow. Live from the inside out. Let the shadows be. Choose to see them all with love. Be kind to yourself. I know I'm working on that right now... lots of love and best of luck with what comes up for you with this solar eclipse! #solareclipse #solareclipse2017 #70percent #centralpark #grateful #shadow #lightvsdark #yinyang #masculine #feminine

Shine. What a beautiful end to quite a process... For the last couple months, I've been teaching 4th and 5th grade students musical theatre. Couldn't be prouder of these kids! They rocked their show (and my world) today. Such a pleasure to work with them. A big thanks to my teaching partner, our teacher helper who designed this glorious poster, and the school for letting us cultivate these kids' creativity. <3 #shine #afterschool #townehall #musicalreview #amteaching #skyline #nyc #bigdipper #proudteacher

One of my favorite rituals--which I'm daring to share a bit of today--is to do both new and full moon ceremonies. Always with a prayer, a tarot deck and a candle, soothing music, an oracle card, and sometimes crystals. This isn't something I share often since I'm aware that there is some stigma surrounding some of these things, particularly where I am from. But this is an important part of my process--to help lay out pieces of my life that need attention, a shift in direction, extra loving or even releasing. I see these as tools to help me to recall what my spirit and my heart know, but puts them into a tangible form that make sense to my waking self--since not all of it is so obvious--so I can work through them in a way that feels aligned for me. It is a way for me to tune into the greater part of myself, the divine that's within.  I know for a fact we can all do that on our own... meditation, prayer, what have you. The possibilities are endless, really. ~ For this ceremony, I used the #NewMoonInGemini spread from @ethony, then promptly had three cards fly out of #TheAliceTarot deck (my go-to), then two oracle cards from #TheMoonDeck managed to snag my attention to help it all come together... The messages felt very impactful and well-timed today, and the encouragement to share more of my process came out loud and clear with the nudges about trusting my intuition more. ~ I know this doesn't resonate with everyone, and that is a-okay. We all have our different ways of learning more about this complex soul-in-a-human-body experience. We are always learning, always growing. And for whatever reason, I felt compelled to share this one with you today. Now... how do you like to tune into that greater something within you? (If you do?) #newmoongeminitarot

So many pearls of wisdom in #EatPrayLove. This one felt particularly well-timed... just in case you need it, too. "God dwells within you, as you." Know that divine love is always with you. #wisdom #elizabethgilbert #amreading

Just finished my first legit stage/film combat class, stepped outside and saw this... I'm absolutely floored with gratitude to live in this city, excited to train in ways to add dimension to my craft, and to have the absolute best people in my corner, encouraging me to be even more than I could imagine. Always something new to learn and grow into... Finding these moments of appreciation of where I am always come at just the right moment. New York City is my heartbeat, and these 'scapes make it skip a beat in glee. So much magic to be had, if you open up to it... "I am so grateful. I am so blessed."

What a delight! #TheGreatComet was completely unexpected in almost every way as I got to sit next to a platform the actors frequently utilized. So many delicious moments, from (quite literally) a boxed treat--a Russian roll of some sort that was very nice, a sexy love letter from @thedancecartel, a stroke down my arm, an array of styles of vocals and music (#drool), eye-splitting-yet-somehow-exhilerating light displays, @joshgroban pulling off astounding acting chops, to a squatting accordionist who still has my jaw on the ground (among other dancing instrumentalists). I just love live theatre... especially when it's this interactive and fresh. Definitely worth a see/experience. Thanks for an exciting and refreshingly original Broadway musical! #broadway #wewriteletters #playbill #loveletter #musical #imperialtheatre

I may be heading home from work at 1 am. It may be colder than a witch's titty when it's supposed to be spring. I may be questioning so much about my own direction as an actress and performer. However, I cannot deny the gratitude I feel to be in a city in which dreamers do the work they need to in order to get where they most want to go. I love that New York is my home. I can't express how overwhelmed with love I feel when I realize that I have the best people around me in a place I was once scared I wouldn't make friends in. Now I get to work on television and film sets--sometimes stages--alongside directors, actors and other artists involved who I admire, look up to, and feel privileged to share a space with. I can never guess what's next, and that's one of my favorite things about being here and pursuing opportunities I hadn't even really thought about while in Utah. All I know is that great things are both in the works and happening as I go. There's so much room to grow, shift and evolve. Starting where you are and trusting what feels right for you--and not others' impressions of what's right for you--is one of the best ways to take responsibility for your soul, your life and your relationships. Don't quit. You still have your own skyscraper inside that wants to be built. It will look different from everyone else's... and that's okay. The levels may not follow a typical pattern, but that's even better than building whatever is next to you. Each building in NYC has its own character too. You get to make your skyscraper distinctly your own... it's your duty to yourself. The sky is never the limit, but a direction of infinite possibility. Go for it. #builditanyway #nofilter #empirestatebuilding #followyourheart #trustyourself #inspiration #grateful

Tree sitting. Riverside. Six pages. Releasing frustrations. Mapping out desires, priorities and next steps. Transitioning. Sometimes you gotta listen to that inner voice and also your body. Your emotions want to be felt or else they create a clogged artery that could burst and cause more issues. My body and soul needed quiet time, complete with water, trees, meditation and journaling... What does your body desire today? Listen. It helps you get in line with who you are and what you are here to do. Sending light, love and pixie dust. Magic to come... #journaling #dreaming #priorities #nature #park #metime #decompress #inspiration #intuition #pendulum

The starfish is making itself known today.. Time for regeneration and rebuilding. Following and trusting our gut instincts without question. If your body is asking you to do something and it seems out of left field, listen to it. It may help you in a way you may not expect. So much love to you!

You always find what you need at the right time... For a couple weeks now, the gemstone tourmaline has resounded in my mind several times. It's not a stone I have nor know much about, but it was incessant. Today I was in the neighborhood for the shop I usually go to for crystals (about a year since my introduction to it actually). I bee-lined to where the stones usually sit. I didn't see what I was looking for. But I enjoy the store and felt like I needed an oracle deck, so I stuck around. Near the oracle decks was a black velvet pendant stand, and a pink gemstone caught my eye. I look at the tag: tourmaline. As soon as I touched it, I knew it was the one for me. Looked up its properties and it matches what I need right now. Exactly what I needed right before I decided to leave. Everything for a reason, folks. Trust in the timing of your life and know that whatever is in store for you could be just around the corner or in the last place you look. #tourmaline #gemstone #heart #healing

in the city of lights the natural light of the skies hide dim i wish to see them more the moon, a speckled beacon on a blanket of charcoal blue above the crisp brights set in steel a spectacle many come here to see but, look there! in a flashing line darting in an arc neighboring the moon make a wish and hold on tight you're in for a new kind of ride for the true spectacle doesnt need flashing lights, or a scene on a stage... the true spectacle lies in those that shine on their own in the darkness even if hard to see in some places they still shine anyway alongside the moon as she shares the fullness of her face
