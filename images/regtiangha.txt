When you’re on a budget, every dollar counts. However, that doesn’t mean that you have to skimp on quality, especially when it comes to grub on the @calgarystampede Midway. The BBQ Ribs from Big T’s BBQ was voted Best Value 2017 by our panel of Midway food judges as you get an excellent quality product (and lots of it!) for the price. That those same ribs also won Best BBQ on a Bone 2017 is a bonus. Check them out the next time you’re at Triple B! Booth Z60226. #Stampede2017 #CSFoodie

Nothing beats a refreshing beverage on a hot day and Pits n Peels by @familysqueezed's freshly blended juices are a great way to beat the heat. Available in flavours such as Watermelon Mint, Spicy Mango, Horchata, Hibiscus Grapefruit, Pineapple Coconut and Cucumber Lime, Pits n Peels’ offerings were selected as Best Beverage 2017 by our panel of @calgarystampede Midway food judges. Fun Fact: It’s also the place where you can find the Mini Donut-chata, which won Best New Food – Sweet 2017 as well. #Stampede2017 #CSFoodie

Burgers are a staple of a @calgarystampede Midway foodie’s diet, and luckily, there’s a wide variety available on Park. But which burger truly deserves the title of The Best? A new category this year, Best Burger 2017 goes to Billman’s Steak and Prime Rib for their Cowboy Burger. Two patties, two slices of cheese, two slices of smoked ham, sautéed mushrooms and onions, and pickles mean that you get a lot of burger for the price. Find them near the Dog Bowl and the Stampede Store tent on the Midway, Booth Z30066. #Stampede2017 #CSFoodie

There are currently 198 food trucks licensed in #yyc and many of them are making an appearance at this year’s @calgarystampede.

A new category this year, we recruited a panel of vegetarians to help us find the Best Vegetarian dish on the @calgarystampede Midway. The winner? The Vegetarian Wrap from Wrap Daddy’s, located in front of the Big Four Building. Made of fresh veggies, a vegetable-based protein made of corn, rice and oats, and a tomato-based salsa made fresh every morning, if you hold the sour cream and cheese, it then becomes a vegan-friendly option as well.  So make sure to let all your friends know the next time they’re wondering if there’s anything for them on the Midway! Booth Z10021. #Stampede2017 #CSFoodie

After the #Stampede2016 Celebrity Best New Food judging event last night (FYI:  Best New Food - Savoury went to the Teriyaki Chicken Perogies by the International Perogies booth, and Best New Food - Sweet went to the Salted Caramel Deep Fried Coffee by Ogopogo Concessions), the lady at Canadian @beaverballs left us with some of the extra meal worms used in the Sticky Toffee Bug Balls (which came in second place by only 0.14 points!). We haven't decided what to do with them yet, although the intent is to have them finished off by the end of the week. It'll be a form of punishment for our volunteers, of course, but a swear jar seems too easy. Any suggestions? #CSFoodie

My notes from the @calgaryexpo panel on Writing 101: Maintaining a Dialogue with S. G. Wong, Axel Howerton, Andrew Foley & Dave Gross: 1) Dialogue serves exposition differently in prose (narration may be better), drama (necessary), video games (better to use cutscene), etc. 2) DO use 'said' to cap off your dialogue. It's less obvious than using fancy adverbs. 3) Try not to use adverbs too much. 4) The never-fail test is to read your dialogue out loud, ideally with a different person. 5) DO in prose fiction reveal character through dialogue. (Ex. Freudian slips; small revealing actions like wince). Try to avoid monologue. 6) To increase tension, use shorter sentences. To slow things down, have some characters take a pause or speak slower and/or longer. 7) In written dialogue, people rarely speak as people do in real life. There are a lot of ums, ahs, likes in regular speech that doesn't translate well to then page. 8) DO differentiate dialogue with different traits and speech patterens, but DON'T do accents or regional dialects unless you're experienced in that language. Try to avoid broken english as it doesn't come across  very well. Rather than add in accents, try using words from those dialects to add in that flavour. Example: Japanese Yakuza slips in Japanese terms when stressed. Have native speakers vet your written work to be sure you're doing it write. If you do it wrong, you'll look like an idiot.You could also try giving readers a taste starting with an accent and then switch to proper english to make things more readable. 9) General rule of thumb in comic books:  No single word balloon should have more than 20 words, no panel should have more than 30 words. 10) When writing a big reveal, all the things  that are false need to be presented first with clues leading up to the reveal are seeded throughout so that the reveal is short, surprising and doesn't need explaining. #CalgaryExpo

My notes from the @calgaryexpo panel on Things to Think About When Writing Strong Women with Adam Dreece: 1) We all start with a bias. Need to be concious of it, challenge and overcome it. 2) Silly Assumptions: A) Equality means the same, B) If a woman is crying, she's sad or upset (10% sad/upset, 20% you should be quiet, 70% chance you should run). THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN DEVELOPING A STRONG CHARACTER: 3) Genetic Traits: Physical elements of the person (strength, size, weight, etc). These can affect how the character interacts with the world and the biases they may need to deal with. Real life is nuanced. Surgery and drugs can modify it. 4) Feminine vs Masculine: Types of traits you give to your characters (ex. Mentor vs nurturer, how they deal with betrayal, etc.). Be concious of the traits you give your characters. 5) Anchoring Personality Traits: Meyers-Briggs (Vision/Task, Social/Detail). Everyone has a dominant one, and you could be missing another. For example, it's common to have a visionary male character. Are there many visionary female characters? 6) Social & Cultural Roles: It's an active chice to make as a writer. How to frame thimgs. A character can be strong, even in 'lowly' roles. 7) Emotional Training & Empathy: Generally, women recieve some emotional training, men often don't. Need to consider how training or lack thereof affects relationships with other characters . 8) Fear is really the mind killer. Overcome the fear of writing a character that you may not be familiar with or have experience with. 9) Things to think about: What's at their core? Be intentional. People have a personality stack that affects their decisions, feeds their background, feeds their present. #CalgaryExpo

My notes from the @calgaryexpo's Indie Author Road (lessons from year one) panel with @AdamDreece: 1) Harsh Reality: The average book now sells 250 copies in its life time. 2) Want reviews? Ask your readers to review your book if they finished it or like it. 3) As an indie author, you are like a startup. You have costs you need to cover/think of. How many copies can you afford to give away for promotional purposes? How can you ensure a good return? Etc. 4) 5 Harsh Realities: A) No one cares about your book. 500,000 indie books coming out this year. B) 250 avg sales life time for books. Think about if paying $5,000 for that cover art is really  worth it; you may not make it back.  C) There is no "sudden gone viral." Don't plan for it; work hard. D) No one knows what they're doing; luck is the biggest factor. E) There is an industry to feed off of you (ex. Sharks). Be careful of sharks. 5) Pros of self publishing: Write and publish at your own pace, easier to innovate and be agile (ex. Charity book bundles, change pricing, etc) 6) If self publishing hard copies, make sure you edit, don't forget margins and page numbers, 11pt font can help with readability but increase cost. 7) You are the brand. How you conduct yourself online and elsewhere will affect your readers. Be mindful how you act in public once you put your work out publicly. 8) Like in regular business, a mailing list is mighty. 9) Networking and meeting people is important; you never know where connections will lead. 10) Free has a price. Big difference in 0 and 99 cents. #CalgaryExpo

Not the best seats, but my writing partner #MiniHarry and I are now sitting in on @calgaryexpo's Tanpopo panel (not the ramen one) with Leah Nicholson and creator Camila d'Errico. #CalgaryExpo

My notes from the @calgaryexpo Worldbuilding panel with Jim Zub, Camila d'Errico, Conor McCreery and Ryan Ferrier: 1) Character and World are both important, but most panelists valued developing characters first before the world. That said, there's value in developing the world in a broad sense first to set the bounding box and themes that your characters will operate in the story, and then use that to help develop and define your characters. 2) One way to beat writer's block: Write a list of things you'd never do. Either it'll help cut down on the things you can't do or reconsider the things that you can do. (Ex: Well, why *can't* we do that?). 3) Good villians have their own moral compass that they operate under. They always have a motivation beyond "take over the world" as it's always something else driving it. (However, taking over the world as the only reason *can* work in comedy). 4) Feel free to steal or borrow from other ideas, but you need to give something back. Add something new, not baltantly rip off. That ain't cool. 5) In terms of exposition: "Never tell people 4, show them 2+2." Another example of "Show, don't tell." 6) There are story twists and character twists. If you want to add one or both of these twists into your story, they both require a slightly different approach. Plot twists are harder than character twists since plot twists need to be unexpected but when they happen, they feel like the natural conclusion. #CalgaryExpo

My notes from Peter Toohey's @calgaryexpo workshop on Jealousy: 1) General Life Advice: When your hair starts to match the color of your shirt, it's time for a different shirt. 2) Jealousy needs 3 people or 2 people and a thing for it to be present. 3) There's a feeling of loss or desire. Heightened emotions. 4) Feeling physical pain is not enough. 5) Sense of profound loss is key. 6) Strong emotions are involved. 7) "Triangles" are common. 8) Jealousy or Envy? Jealousy  is about loss. Envy is about someone having something that you want to gain. They can be mixed up a lot. 9) If you didn't care, you probably wouldn't  feel jealous. You have to care deeply. 10) Jealously acts as a means to balance things between three parties in social situations. A desire for equality. 11) Ultimatum Test: People would rather take a loss than be treated unfairly. 12) Jealousy can be benificial as it can be used to advocate or motivate for equality. #CalgaryExpo

LOTS of great tips at the @CalgaryExpo's Writing 101: Building a Mystery. Here are a few of my notes (hope the formatting comes  through): #CalgaryExpo - Have at least 4 suspects (gives you room to play; more is too much; less is too few). - Make it plausible. - Make sure your clues make sense for each character. That it fits their motivations and fits what"s happening at that time. - Don't assume the readers know your industry jargon. - Plot is paramont. Atmosphere and character are too, but in mystery it's plot. - Figure out the story for each suspect first; the hero has to work backward . - Introduce your villian early; later is a cheat. Make you hero aware  of the villian or meet the villian early. - Keep track of your gadgets.
