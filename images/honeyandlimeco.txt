#AD: My kids are at home all summer long and I swear they want to eat literally every 5 seconds! My kids love waffles, so we grabbed a box of these Kellogg's® Eggo Thick & Fluffy Original ORIGINAL waffles with Madagascar Vanilla and we had to hook them up, dessert style. They are thick and filling, a super sweet indulgence for us, and they taste just like homemade waffles! I went ahead and used some of our favorite summer flavors, like peach and mango, to make these waffles stand out! Try the new and improved Eggo waffles, a great breakfast, snack, and even indulgent dessert for your family! Dowlnoad the @ibottaapp for savings on Eggo Wagfles at @Walmart! #LoveMyEggo #MoreEggo2Love

#Advertisement Ok, parents, I need to know - How are you making sure that your family is getting enough fruits and veggies in your diets each day? With busy summer schedules and picky eaters, it can be tough! Since 90% of Americans do not receive the key nutrients we need from food alone, I have been making sure we take a daily multivitamin and that I serve fresh fruits and vegetables in every meal. One A Day with Nature’s Medley is a complete multivitamin with plant-based antioxidants from one total USDA serving size of fruits and vegetables, making it easy to get the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need each day. They are formulated for men, women, and children ages 4 and up and taste great, my kids can’t wait to get their daily gummies each morning! Stop into your local @CVSPharmacy to grab a 28 ct. trial size bottle today. Link in bio for a $4 coupon! #OneADay

San Diego really spoils us residents. The beaches are beautiful, the weather is never too hot or too cold, and there is so much to do year round! Epic sunsets are also common, it's no wonder they call it America's Finest City. Its also pretty epic how @verizon keeps me connected no matter where I go, its true that #bettermatters.

Definitely unlocked my field trip chaperone badge with this one! Took a guided Rose Canyon hike and the 80 degree weather and "snakes spotted on the trails" warning made this one special lol. Kids had a blast though, and we saw NO snakes! 🐍 #RoseCanyon #fieldtrip #hikingtrails #chaperonelife

Y'all - I grabbed this bottle of 19 Crimes Red Blend and I am definitely bringing it to our next adult game night! With the Living Wine Labels app, you can watch these 19 Crimes and other labels come to life and be immersed into the stories behind each brand through an augmented reality experience like i've never seen. When you scan the labels on the #19Crimes bottles, you'll come face to face with real convicts from the 1700's who were guilty of at least 1 of 19 crimes, who tell you their side of the story. Yes, the labels speak to you! I am a sucker for a good #redblend, and the 19 Crimes Red Blend is not only full and robust, but it comes with a fun experience, too! Purchase 19 Crimes and the other Living Wines varieties at Kroger, Ralph's, and Fred Meyer, and download the Living Wine Labels app on the Google Play Store and Apple Store, and #UncorkTheStory! #ad

Loved the cute little Getsemani neighborhood in Cartagena, Colombia.  With street performers and delicious food open late, it seems like they go all night long! We spent some time in #CafeHavana dancing the night away to a live salsa band, then had street arepas at 4am. Take me back, such good times with the crew! 🇨🇴💃🏽 —————————————————— #cartagenacolombia #visitcolombia #colombiatravel #passportready #taketripspostpics #cartagenadeindia #colombianas #instapassport #travelbloggers #triptocolombia #cartagena2018 #vivacolombia #ig_travels #shetravels #travelersnotebook #visitcartagena #cartagenadeindias #travelerslife #getsemani

Top of the Mountain view of the city. The peak of Cowles Mountain is 1,591 feet above sea level and is the highest point in San Diego.

What do you do after dinner when you’ve had 3 glasses of wine? 🍷 You randomly walk to a massage parlor! We may have been a little too loud, eaten more than our fair share of the little candies, and it’s possible that we almost got kicked out. 😂 Good times last night! #mygirls #impromptudinner #latenightmassage #sandiegonights

Hi, y’all! We’re stepping up our oral health routine and we’ve started using @Crest ® Gum Detoxify™ toothpaste as an easy toothpaste swap. We are loving this #toothpaste so far, it has Activated Foam technology that cools the gums during and after brushing, and is able to get under the gums where toothbrushes can’t reach. Not only will your teeth be clean, but the Activated Foam in #Crest ® Gum Detoxify™ toothpaste will penetrate those hard to reach places where bacteria hides and go the extra step for you! This has been an easy way to get my mouth extra clean every day - no issues, no fuss! #ForGumsSake #ad

Bogotá, Colombia :: The only possible perk of sitting in the heinous traffic in Bogotá would be that you can clearly see the local terrain and some of the sights. We passed these colorful buildings riding on a highway to the outside of the city.

I have been on a health kick since last November after our Thanksgiving cruise (I gained 5 pounds in 5 days, shhh… it’s gone now) and I am happy to say that I’ve stuck with my healthy eating and exercise routine! I’m currently working on making more and more healthy swaps in my lifestyle, including self care, and more recently, oral care. Today, I shared a list of 5 easy healthy lifestyle swaps to try on the blog now, including why I switched out my regular toothpaste with new Crest® Gum Detoxify™ toothpaste. It does a great job of getting below the gum line, y’all! One thing that I noticed is that switching out something that’s already in your daily routine makes it so much easier to stick to it!

My guy. Smart, independent, kind, outgoing, hilarious, and courageous. He is such a tweenager and was completely against strolling at the farmers market today, but he rolled without any complaints. We got to see a glimpse of the end of the #womensmarch in Downtown San Diego, and I am glad he got to see all of the signs, and especially, the men who were involved! #lovethisguy

I picked up a giant sea slug! We explored the tide pools today and saw about 20-30 of these things. Super neat, I’ve been to tide pools many times but I’ve never seen a large sea slug! 🐚

Sick in bed, all day. Who gets sick when they have several things to do before Christmas? THIS GAL. My head is throbbing, nose is clogged, the sneezing and coughing won’t end, and there’s a dull, stuffy feeling in my head and down the sides of my neck. I managed to get up and finish some work this morning, but dassit. Not getting out of bed anytime soon, send more honey, lemons, a bae, and a massage! 🍋 🍯

The highlight of our hosted trip to @glenivy_spa yesterday was the bath we took at Club Mud! Step into the mud pool and cover your skin with hot springs clay mud. This full body therapy draws out impurities and exfoliates dead skin cells, leaving smooth glowing skin! After this, we dried in a special drying chamber and brushed off the mud. What a fun experience! Visit Glen Ivy this holiday season for a massage or hot springs soak, it’s my favorite SoCal spa retreat! #glenivy #mudbath #ClubMud #spaday #glenivyhotsprings #melaninonfleek

This beautiful, white sand beach with turquoise waters can be found on the island of #Antigua! As you know, their sister island #Barbuda was decimated by Hurricane Irma and subsequently evacuated. Tourism is the lead driving force in the @AntiguaAndBarbuda economy, so please consider adding Antigua to your travel bucket list. You’ll enjoy tons of gorgeous beaches (365 to be exact!), fabulous weather, delicious Caribbean cuisine, plenty of attractions, warm, friendly locals, and you’ll be helping to rebuild Barbuda with your visit!

The kids learned a few tricks from master builders at @LegolandCalifornia! They say that being a #LEGO builder at the theme park is an awesome fun career and requires a degree in architecture, engineering, art, design, and similar fields. Their task was to build something to compliment the LEGO NINJAGO City set and they delivered! #LEGONINJAGOmovie AD

We had a great time exploring the @CityofDenver! It was our first time in the downtown area, it's so full of life during the summer! When you visit, don't miss the lengthy outdoor @16thstreetmall with free shuttle service, visit a museum, pop into a @novocoffee shop, enjoy a meal in Larimer Square, and make sure you get out to a Colorado @Rockies game. Next time, we'll visit the outskirts and head out to the Rocky Mountains! Have you been to Denver?

There's not a much better way to end the day than with this perfect Italian sunset, seen while walking over the Ponte Carraia bridge in Florence. We walked all over the place today and went to the Central Market for dinner like the locals do. Love this city! 🇮🇹 #FlorenceItaly . . . . . #firenzeitalia #florenceitaly #iloveflorence #italia365 #italiansunset #sunsetsinitaly #italygram #florencebynight #visititaly #shetravels #wanderers #sunsets #sunsetlover #italiagram #firenzecityitaly #firenze🇮🇹 #beautifulitaly #igsunset #sunsetlover #bridgeview #pontecarraia

We took a bike ride through the rolling hills of #Tuscany with @bike_florence_and_tuscany. This was about 30 minutes outside of #Florence, we shopped in the little village of #SanGimignano, tasted wine in the medieval castle of #Monteriggioni, and strolled through the streets in Siena, Italy. This whole area is gorgeous, such a beautiful bike ride! 🚴 . . . . . #firenzeitalia #florenceitaly #iloveflorence #italia365 #tuscanyitaly #sunsetsinitaly #italygram #biketour #florencetuscany #visititaly #shetravels #wanderers #bikerides #bikeinflorence #italiagram #firenzecityitaly #firenze🇮🇹 #beautifulitaly #tuscanygram #tuscany #bridgeview #tuscanyhills #biketuscany

It was so warm and breezy in Venice that I had to rock this cute calypso maxi skirt from @CabiClothing! There were so many photo worthy spots, but I love this distressed brick wall.

A gondolier prepares his private gondola for the day. Gondolas and water taxis are the primary mode of transportation in Venice. Plush seating and comfortable chairs make this a pricey ride, you can find one on literally any canal entrance! . . . . #italia #venezia #veneziagram #veniceitaly #veneziaitalia #venicegondola #gondolier #venicevacation #visititaly #europetrip #shetravels #firsttimeinitaly #gondolas #venicecanals #italygram #canalview #venicelife #travelbloggers #italytrip #niceviews #venicebridge #travelerinitaly #gondola #gondolaride

Sister selfie in Piazza San Marco! Behind us is the majestic Basilica Di San Marco, it is huge and such an amazing historic sight! We've walked miles around Venice, over canal bridges, past tons of pizzerias, and we may have gotten lost a time or two in the narrow alleys! Next up, gelato! . . . . #veniceitaly #piazzasanmarco #wandering #venezia #basilicasanmarco #italia #venezia #veneziagram #veniceitaly #veneziaitalia #venicevacation #visititaly #europetrip #shetravels #firsttimeinitaly #venicecanals #italygram #venicelife #travelbloggers #italytrip #tripping #niceviews #venicebridge #travelerinitaly #sanmarcovenezia

I'm vacationing in Italy this week and #Venice is the first stop! I am in love with this city already, all of the colorful Italian architecture, the canals, and the walkable cobblestone streets make this a unique and beautiful European city!
