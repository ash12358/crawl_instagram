#AD: My kids are at home all summer long and I swear they want to eat literally every 5 seconds! My kids love waffles, so we grabbed a box of these Kellogg's¬Æ Eggo Thick & Fluffy Original ORIGINAL waffles with Madagascar Vanilla and we had to hook them up, dessert style. They are thick and filling, a super sweet indulgence for us, and they taste just like homemade waffles! I went ahead and used some of our favorite summer flavors, like peach and mango, to make these waffles stand out! Try the new and improved Eggo waffles, a great breakfast, snack, and even indulgent dessert for your family! Dowlnoad the @ibottaapp for savings on Eggo Wagfles at @Walmart! #LoveMyEggo #MoreEggo2Love

#Advertisement Ok, parents, I need to know - How are you making sure that your family is getting enough fruits and veggies in your diets each day? With busy summer schedules and picky eaters, it can be tough! Since 90% of Americans do not receive the key nutrients we need from food alone, I have been making sure we take a daily multivitamin and that I serve fresh fruits and vegetables in every meal. One A Day with Nature‚Äôs Medley is a complete multivitamin with plant-based antioxidants from one total USDA serving size of fruits and vegetables, making it easy to get the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need each day. They are formulated for men, women, and children ages 4 and up and taste great, my kids can‚Äôt wait to get their daily gummies each morning! Stop into your local @CVSPharmacy to grab a 28 ct. trial size bottle today. Link in bio for a $4 coupon!¬†#OneADay

San Diego really spoils us residents. The beaches are beautiful, the weather is never too hot or too cold, and there is so much to do year round!

Y'all - I grabbed this bottle of 19 Crimes Red Blend and I am definitely bringing it to our next adult game night! With the Living Wine Labels app, you can watch these 19 Crimes and other labels come to life and be immersed into the stories behind each brand through an augmented reality experience like i've never seen. When you scan the labels on the #19Crimes bottles, you'll come face to face with real convicts from the 1700's who were guilty of at least 1 of 19 crimes, who tell you their side of the story. Yes, the labels speak to you! I am a sucker for a good #redblend, and the 19 Crimes Red Blend is not only full and robust, but it comes with a fun experience, too! Purchase 19 Crimes and the other Living Wines varieties at¬†Kroger, Ralph's, and Fred Meyer, and download the Living Wine Labels app on the¬†Google Play Store and Apple Store, and #UncorkTheStory! #ad

Loved the cute little Getsemani neighborhood in Cartagena, Colombia.  With street performers and delicious food open late, it seems like they go all night long! We spent some time in #CafeHavana dancing the night away to a live salsa band, then had street arepas at 4am. Take me back, such good times with the crew! üá®üá¥üíÉüèΩ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî #cartagenacolombia #visitcolombia #colombiatravel #passportready #taketripspostpics #cartagenadeindia #colombianas #instapassport #travelbloggers #triptocolombia #cartagena2018 #vivacolombia #ig_travels #shetravels #travelersnotebook #visitcartagena #cartagenadeindias #travelerslife #getsemani

What do you do after dinner when you‚Äôve had 3 glasses of wine? üç∑ You randomly walk to a massage parlor!

Hi, y‚Äôall! We‚Äôre stepping up our oral health routine and we‚Äôve started using @Crest ¬Æ Gum Detoxify‚Ñ¢ toothpaste as an easy toothpaste swap. We are loving this #toothpaste so far, it has Activated Foam technology that cools the gums during and after brushing, and is able to get under the gums where toothbrushes can‚Äôt reach. Not only will your teeth be clean, but the Activated Foam in #Crest ¬Æ Gum Detoxify‚Ñ¢ toothpaste will penetrate those hard to reach places where bacteria hides and go the extra step for you! This has been an easy way to get my mouth extra clean every day - no issues, no fuss! #ForGumsSake #ad

I have been on a health kick since last November after our Thanksgiving cruise (I gained 5 pounds in 5 days, shhh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gone now) and I am happy to say that I‚Äôve stuck with my healthy eating and exercise routine! I‚Äôm currently working on making more and more healthy swaps in my lifestyle, including self care, and more recently, oral care. Today, I shared a list of 5 easy healthy lifestyle swaps to try on the blog now, including why I switched out my regular toothpaste with new Crest¬Æ Gum Detoxify‚Ñ¢ toothpaste. It does a great job of getting below the gum line, y‚Äôall! One thing that I noticed is that switching out something that‚Äôs already in your daily routine makes it so much easier to stick to it!

You guuyyysssss! I went to the #BlackPanther movie premiere and Y‚ÄôALL. I can‚Äôt even tell you how amazing it was to see the first black superhero on the big screen! Action. Badassness. Suspense. Hilarity. Blackness. All wrapped into ONE. The special effects are insane and they‚Äôre able to effectively convey beautiful message of unity and peace. I LOVED this movie and I know you will too, make sure you mark your calendars to hit the theater to see #BlackPantherMovie February 16th! #BlackPantherEvent #BlackPantherPremiere #blacksuperheroes #yaassss #BlackPantherSoLit #wakanda #wakandaforever #pressevent #disneypresstrip #marveluniverse #marvelblackpanther #tchalla

I really try to instill certain values upon my kids, and kindness is definitely one of them. Celebrate World Kindness Day today with us and make it a point to be helpful, considerate, and show kindness to someone. In today's world, we all need a little bit of love and compassion in our lives! #ChooseKindness #KindnessDay #ChooseSmiles #BeKind #HelpOthers #TheWonderMovie #WondertheBook #LoveOneAnother #KindnessMatters #LoveOthers #ShowLove #BeKindAlways #RJPalacio #WonderBook @crest

This beautiful, white sand beach with turquoise waters can be found on the island of #Antigua! As you know, their sister island #Barbuda was decimated by Hurricane Irma and subsequently evacuated.

You‚Äôll enjoy tons of gorgeous beaches (365 to be exact!), fabulous weather, delicious Caribbean cuisine, plenty of attractions, warm, friendly locals, and you‚Äôll be helping to rebuild Barbuda with your visit!

Reminiscing about my trip to Venice, Italy. We were considering a private gondola ride, but it was the equivalent of $100 USD for a short trip. üò≥ We jumped on a gondola taxi instead for 2 Euro and sailed the Grand Canal standing the whole way! Today, I shared 10 Venice travel tips for first timers, lots of good stuff to know before you go on honeyandlime.co! . . . . . #italia #venezia #veneziagram #veniceitaly #veneziaitalia #grandcanal #gondolaview #venicegondola #gondolier #venicevacation #visititaly #europetrip #shetravels #gondolas #venicecanals #italygram #canalview #venicelife #travelbloggers #italytrip #niceviews #venicebridge #travelerinitaly #gondola #gondolaride #travelislife #justgo #passportholder

There's not a much better way to end the day than with this perfect Italian sunset, seen while walking over the Ponte Carraia bridge in Florence. We walked all over the place today and went to the Central Market for dinner like the locals do.

We took a bike ride through the rolling hills of #Tuscany with @bike_florence_and_tuscany. This was about 30 minutes outside of #Florence, we shopped in the little village of #SanGimignano, tasted wine in the medieval castle of #Monteriggioni, and strolled through the streets in Siena, Italy. This whole area is gorgeous, such a beautiful bike ride! üö¥ . . . . . #firenzeitalia #florenceitaly #iloveflorence #italia365 #tuscanyitaly #sunsetsinitaly #italygram #biketour #florencetuscany #visititaly #shetravels #wanderers #bikerides #bikeinflorence #italiagram #firenzecityitaly #firenzeüáÆüáπ #beautifulitaly #tuscanygram #tuscany #bridgeview #tuscanyhills #biketuscany

A gondolier prepares his private gondola for the day. Gondolas and water taxis are the primary mode of transportation in Venice. Plush seating and comfortable chairs make this a pricey ride, you can find one on literally any canal entrance! . . . . #italia #venezia #veneziagram #veniceitaly #veneziaitalia #venicegondola #gondolier #venicevacation #visititaly #europetrip #shetravels #firsttimeinitaly #gondolas #venicecanals #italygram #canalview #venicelife #travelbloggers #italytrip #niceviews #venicebridge #travelerinitaly #gondola #gondolaride

Sister selfie in Piazza San Marco! Behind us is the majestic Basilica Di San Marco, it is huge and such an amazing historic sight! We've walked miles around Venice, over canal bridges, past tons of pizzerias, and we may have gotten lost a time or two in the narrow alleys!
