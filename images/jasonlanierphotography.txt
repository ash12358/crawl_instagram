Safari Round 2- it was a dream come true the first time I went 6 years ago...it’s surreal I get to do it again... I even brought my old iPod from six years ago that had all my favorite @philhendrie show stuff on there that is hilarious. I listened to it last time while shooting the wildlife and I’m gonna do the same this time around. Safari for 11 days and then events in Johannesburg and Cape Town.  For those who can come out to say hello...thank you in advance.  I very much look forward to meeting all of you soon! #tia #thisisawesome #thisisafrica #jasonlanier #kruger #wildlife #safari #jasonlanierphotography

Luggage Ready- I think my favorite thing about the @rotolight Explorer Kit is that it’s three lights and three light stands that all fit very comfortably in my luggage.  The kit has become my Go To for most of my Lighting needs.  See the vegetable chips?  Taking my diet with me to Africa..:). Do you think lions like vegetable chips??? For more info on the lights please visit www.jasonlanier.com/rotolight Lol I can’t wait for silly people to lecture me about not feeding lions...lol.  I’m just joking y’all! #jasonlanier #rotolight #explorer

The 4 Musketeers!! I had to see my dudes off at scout camp because when they come home I’ll be flying to Africa for safari.

Never forget what matters most....BE A GOOD DAD... #jasonlanier #dad #camping #scouts

How To Light a Wedding Reception- make sure to be on the lookout for an upcoming video from my REAL Wedding Workshop in Grand Cayman at the Ritz Carlton where I show you all how I use the Rotolight Neo 2 inside of the Westcott Halo to create beautiful soft and portable lighting that both illuminates as a continuous light and strobes when needed. For more information on Rotolight please visit www.jasonlanier.com/rotolight. For a link to the Westcott Halo please visit: https://www.fjwestcott.com/45-round-halo?acc=1c383cd30b7c298ab50293adfecb7b18 There's honestly no better way to light for a wedding reception...so stay tuned for more details where you'll see exactly how we do it. www.youtube.com/jasonlanierpros #learnphotography #jasonlanierworkshops #jasonlanier #realweddingworkshops #rotolight #neo2 #jasonlanierphotography #grandcayman #ritzcarlton #softlight #offcameraflash #hss #westcott

Never Say Anything Negatively To Yourself That you Should NOT say to Anyone Else..... I just had a conversation with my sons about the importance of not devaluing yourself.  Many times we are very hard on ourselves.  Many times we are TOO hard. I'm a huge believer in Self Awareness and understanding where your weaknesses are and what you need to do to improve.... But calling yourself worthless, ugly, bad, dumb, unloved, etc has a debilitating effect on your soul.  If you say it long and loud enough to yourself, you will indeed believe it. Yes, you can actually kill your own soul with your words. Conversely talking yourself into things can be the most potent weapon ever for your improvement. "You CAN do this." "You do have value." "BELIEVE in yourself," are words that your soul needs to hear to believe. So the next time you wanna destroy your own self worth remember....if it would be horrible for you to utter those words to someone else, you should never utter them to yourself.... #jasonlanierworkshops #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #belief #inspiration

Favorite YouTube Comment of the Day- if you say everyone is equal as a photographer based merely upon the fact that a person owns a camera... Then we should just all buy cameras, start charging money and everyone should be paid the same. While we’re at it let’s give participation trophies to everyone and stop all competition altogether... Competition is great...bettering yourself is wonderful. Losing, getting your butt kicked and improving afterwards is the BEST... So go and get your butt kicked my friends...there’s no better way to learn how to kick it yourself if it’s never been done to you... Competition- it’s essential for the soul and critical for your development. #noparticipationtrophieshere #earnit

NEVER become too busy for your kids...if you neglect them you’re neglecting the future...and you’ll bear a responsibility for how it unfolds... Out here at Ronald Reagan park for a 4th of July celebration...fitting because that dude was a pretty awesome President...I listened to a speech he gave earlier today and loved how he spoke from the heart about freedom and how it’s something that all human beings deserve referencing our Declaration of Independence. Playing in the park surrounded by white, brown, black people also playing alongside us from all over the world all celebrating today...it was pretty special. We should all be free...and be good parents too..:) #jasonlanier #familytime #usa

Get it...no excuses.  I’m legally disabled, I wear ankle braces, I’m missing more than half of my hip socket, I have really bad sciatica and I don’t care... I just want to be in shape and healthy more than I want to use those things as excuses for not being who I want to be. Stop regretting who you are and embrace and become who you want to be. Go do it.... #jasonlanier #fitness #health

Shooting Gay/Same Sex Weddings- A Professional Photographers Perspective/Opinion....I filmed a video detailing my thoughts on my experience after shooting the first gay wedding celebration to take place on the Cayman Islands yesterday at the Ritz Carlton for Anthony and Jeff....click below to view it now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVIXxvLdUnc For some this is a no brainer, for others it's an issue they truly struggle with. For me, it was something that took time for me to decide what I wanted to do....and my thoughts on the entire issue are shared in this short video filmed after the wedding ended last night. I hope it helps people out there.

Celebrating Love and Making History- today was truly a special day for me as well as my wonderful couple Anthony and Jeff.

Challenge Accepted- you guys asked to see some cheap stuff and how it would fair in my work and videos.... So I ordered a bunch of cheap crap off of Amazon Prime for my trip to the Cayman Islands, Seattle and San Francisco... I don’t believe in cheap lights but modifiers.....hmmmmm 🤫 we shall see...:) Btw, don’t get offended by the word “crap”.

What Does It Mean to Be Great?  What Does It Mean to Leave a Legacy? Very few people in the world know the name of my Dad.  His name was Joseph.  He wasn't famous, he didn't lead what some would consider an adventurous life. But to those who mattered.  He was a Legend. Being a Dad isn't about being the strongest, smartest, or coolest guy on the planet.  Being a Dad is about giving everything you have to and for your kids...even when they may not reciprocate or even care. It's about knowing what your family needs...even when they may not want it.  It's about taking the heat and keeping your cool.  It's about teaching boys to become men and teaching girls how they should expect to be treated by men.  And for a man, there is no greater role or duty on earth. I can honestly and unequivocally say that I would be lost without my Dad.  He was my everything.  He was who I aspire to be.  He left a gentle, soft spoken example of how a man can love his family more than himself.  Of how a man can sacrifice his own wants because more than anything, he wanted to be a Dad. I would give anything for 1 more conversation with him.  Just one more night.  But he's been gone now for 10 years and there isn't a day that goes by...that I don't think about him. This man taught me work ethic, compassion, strength, humility and love.  He was the best man I've ever known, and I can't wait to one day see him again. The strongest evidence of his legacy is in his children.  He and my amazing Mom gave birth to 6 of us.  5 boys and 1 girl.  I think what makes me so proud to call myself a Lanier is in knowing that all 5 men strive to be truly great Dads.  And my sister made sure to marry a man who strives to do the same. So on this Father's Day just remember.  Your kids may be close to you, or they may be far away.  You may reach out to them and they may not reach back.  Perhaps you've neglected some of your duties as a Dad and this day is hard for you. Remember....It's never too late to be a Dad.  You can't replace the days you've lost, but you can maximize the days ahead.  You don't have to be famous, you don't have to be a rockstar to your kids.  But if you give them your love, you

Raising the bar of Photography By Remaining True to Yourself- we are coming CHARLOTTE!! I’m feeling more free and better than ever.  I’ve said for over a month now that the old me was coming back and yesterday was the manifestation of that. Dallas felt like coming full circle for me.  It was reuniting with old friends and making many new ones.  It started off with NYC which really rekindled some passion.. In NYC I felt that need to and want to shoot again. I left and went back to Los Angeles and did a shoot that was just FUN. And then Dallas was where it just all came out.  I felt the ABILITY to be ME AGAIN.  I can’t get over how good last night felt as a photographer. Unabashed, unafraid, no hesitation, just being me and loving every single second of it.  The energy with that group was electric. That’s called love y’all...that’s called passion.  It’s what and why I started sharing my love of photography.  I do this because I love spending time with fellow photographers.  I love watching their eyes light up when they see something done that they haven’t seen before...because I remember what that felt like for me...and how grateful I was for those who gave me a peek behind the magical curtain of image creation. Find the right gear that works for you has never meant more to me than it does right now....because you have to find the gear that echoes your heart and voice. NEVER BE AFRAID TO BE WHO YOU ARE.  NEVER SELL OUT, and NEVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS... Xoxo OG Fedora #learnphotography #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #breakingtheshackles

The Calm Before the Storm on a Night I will NEVER forget...this was as OLD SCHOOL as it gets for me y’all... This is my group from my Dallas workshop yesterday..I can’t tell you how amazing it was to work with them. We ended the workshop and I told them they could stick around and watch me shoot like I used to in the “old days” where Vanden and I would shoot and play until the batteries quit and our bodies were hurting... Well last night my entire workshop attendee crew turned into a massive volunteer crew and I was so honored to see the ENTIRE group stick with from an extra 5 hours after the workshop as 1 shoot turned into 5 and we ended just before 2am!! It was epic. The cops showed up to make sure we weren’t doing anything bad which was awesome.  The ladies I shot including @aly_182, @jennybeeofficial, @kaylamarielife and @carminerose_ honestly KILLED IT.  I mean they KILLED IT. The models all did such a great job that they are all coming with me to Charlotte TODAY!! We did some old school shooting with vape smoke, broken bikes, urbex, graffiti, and more.  All with some crazy lighting set ups with the @rotolight that I can’t wait to share with all of you... Yes it was all recorded but I have to see how much we cut because it was a raucous and fun shoot to say the least 😂. Truly reminded of days with Vanden and my old crew... A BIG thanks to my man @jcbraun66 for coming and assisting and to @jeff_via_photography for helping out so much.  I love you guys! And to all the attendees...you all have a very special place in my heart.  I’ll never forget last night.  It was EPIC in so many of the right and crazy ways... Breaking the shackles baby...let the games BEGIN.... #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #learnphotography #rotolight #mirrorless #texas #dallas

Showing value and making money when you do- I just had @jennybeeofficial share this shot with me that @gonzoshotsnyc took of me in NYC during my photo walk... I’m so grateful for shots like this and it makes me realize why our job as photographers is so special when we are able to give this feeling to our clients, friends and family. At my Texas workshop today I expressed the need for us as photographers to show people the value of what we do.  See, I would pay for a shot like this of me..why?  Because I love it and it makes me feel much better than just cellphone pics of me. So go and show people your value...they’ll pay for it if you can show them what you can do..:) #jasonlanierphotography #learnphotography #jasonlanier #value

Health Insurance for Entrepreneurs- it’s not cheap, but when you need health insurance as a photographer it’s vital. My case of poison ivy got out of control and spread to hives on my neck and other areas...lol I flew into Dallas and immediately found an ER.  I got a steroid shot and some more steroids to take over the next week.  Watch out trolls...lol Well, Kaiser covers it all on my plan when I’m out of state.  I even called and verified and so did the ER. My arm will be sore tomorrow, but if I didn’t come in today I’d be looking like the Elephant Man tomorrow because it was starting to spread FAST!!! My plan is $550/month per person for each member of my family...it isn’t cheap but when you need it, it’s a lifesaver. THIS POST IS NOT SPONSORED BY KAISER 😂 People ask me a lot about insurance so I thought I’d share...can’t wait for my workshop tomorrow!!! #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #learnphotography #healthinsurance #entrepreneur #kaiser

Layover Love- that moment when you’re stuck on a long layover due to delays and a man walks up to you and shows you a video of you...and then tells you. “I’m the one coming to your workshop in Dallas, you filmed this for me!!” Back in December his wife reached out to me and asked me to record a video for him because my workshop was his Christmas present...it’s so surreal to meet people like that just randomly at airports lol... It’s been hours but the flight is FINALLY boarding to Dallas and we are on our way.  A big thanks to @randyknowles_dragonflymedia for keeping me awake and watching my bags while I ran to grab a Diet Coke. It’s gonna be HOT and awesome in Dallas!! #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #learnphotography

Red Velvet- it's been so fun to get back to shooting some stuff for me...:) Today was the first day this year that I went out and did a shoot just for me......and it felt SO GOOD!! This is of the beautiful Jenny Bee in a studio in Manhattan. The lighting is coming from the house lighting where they put some lights on the wall behind diffusion panel doors on the side of the studio. And yes, I actually had two awesome dudes Tim Davis and Chris Conlon film the session for me with their gear....Panasonic no less lol! I'm eager to see what the footage looked like. AND, this will be the first time I've handed over the footage for someone else to edit....we'll see how they do... Hope you like it! Video coming SOON......

You're not a REAL Photographer.....I met with two men last night in Times Square to discuss some very exciting new projects that we have in store for all of you.... SOME of these projects might INCLUDE you...:) Well, one of the men told me a story of a conversation that occurred between he and his child....it went like this. Child- "Hey Dad, where are you going?" Dad- "I'm going to see Jason Lanier, that guy on Youtube." Child- "Wow, Dad.  You're going to see a real photographer." Dad- "What do you mean by a real photographer." Child- "He's been arrested by the cops Dad.  Everyone knows you aren't a real photographer until you've been arrested by the cops DAD." LOL, gotta love kids!! #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #funny #cops #realphotographer

New York State of Mind- we’ll, it took driving in carpool lanes, parking illegally, and a fair amount of running but I made it to my flight to NYC!!!

JPEG Shooter?  I'll tell you what....I've never shot jpeg as much as I have with the A7iii.  Raw is still better...but the gap is closing my friends.

Diffusion.....not only works great in life but also in photography....it's been awhile, but I got out to do a shoot today with the stunning @cas_caballero in an abandoned powerhouse in Norco, CA. I hung the diffuser from a nail in the wall and it truly cut the light beautifully allowing me to blend and balance the light with her and the surroundings.... Video to come soon. Always amazing to shoot with Cassandra! Thanks to @quishamothershed and Chris Sutton for helping out today. You guys are awesome! #diffusion #light #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #urbex #abandoned

Name the Action Figure!!!! In my travels I meet so many amazing people.  One of these people is named Jon Stynes who designs high end games and action figures type statues. These aren’t cheap plastic things...they are legit like Dungeons and Dragons type stuff. Recently he asked me about making an action figure for me that would could make available for those who wanted to use me as a paperweight or weapon 😂 Well he’s made one with the help of a world famous digital sculptor and I was floored by how awesome it turned out. Problem is we need a name for the character!! I’m going with El Fedora....what do you guys think...? What should we name him??? #jasonlanier #actionfigure #photographer

Artisans Unite!  A big thanks to @tonygalephoto for helping to organize and take this image of my fellow Artisans at the @sonyalpha Kando event last week. It’s such an honor for me to be part of such a special group of creators. The only thing that would make this better is if we did an Artisan pic that resembled something like the Avengers.... Hmmm...that would be fun!

Thank you to two ladies, amazing attendees, @sonyalpha and @rotolight!  You know with all of the craziness going on over the last month I haven't had the chance to post our traditional shot in front of Pinewood Studios that I take every time I go there for a presentation..... A BIG thanks to @lalunetta for joining me on yet another epic adventure and to @aspenm_ for joining me for the first time to London!  These two ladies are amazing and I couldn't have done the workshop and events without them. And of course a HUGE thanks to all of those that attended the events.  None of this is possible without your support...:) I have to throw some love to my brother @rodgammons who is so instrumental in all of this.  Thank you my man! More BTS shots and videos to come! #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #pinewoodstudios #sonyartisanofimagery #rotolight #masteroflight #london

The Truth About Ken Wheeler, Cancer Patients, and Fraud- this isn't a video about trolls or haters.  It's the story of a man who's used his social media influence to sell lies and try to destroy people's business and families, most notably mine. THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO BE SHARED.....and you can do so from my posting of it on my personal page. He's made allegations that I've cheated clients out of money who have cancer....you really can't make this stuff up.  And I hope you give it a watch... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flh5xAyin3Y You really should watch and SHARE this.  This is the reality of what I've been putting up with in my dealings with Ken Wheeler, the Angry Photographer.  Even after spending my time and money to make nice with him last year, he just won't stop. He's obsessed, he's crazed, and he needs to be stopped.  This story is hard to believe but it's true... And it starts with us getting the word out about this man. The wild allegations against me will undoubtedly continue...you can't trust anything you hear anymore. Yes, I was genuinely hurt and stunned at this betrayal by Ken, and you'll see that through our text message exchange. Ignoring a cavity only leads to further decay and eventually losing your tooth.  You have to deal with the problem.  And that's what I'm doing here. #fraud #lie #deceit #sonyartisanofimagery #kenwheeler #angryphotographer

A big thanks to @rotolight and @sonyalpha for having me come and present twice yesterday at @wexphotovideo in London.  It truly was an honor spending the day with all the amazing people there!!! I come back for the Camera World Live Show in late October and stay to do more events with Sony and Rotolight in London and Manchester.  I can’t wait to see all of you again!  A big thanks to @lalunetta for taking these production shots...:) #london #rotolight #wexphoto #sonyartisanofimagery #masteroflight #manchester #learnphotography

Changing the Lighting Game- A couple of questions came up at the Pinewood Presentation yesterday: 1. Can any Rotolight product overpower the sun? 2. How does a Rotolight perform at a narrow aperture like f/8? 3. How soft is the light really when it's unmodified? This was shot today in direct sun, no clouds (I know, rare for London), on a shoot we did on an antique lightship.  Shot at f/8, ISO 100, and 1/200 sec.  Other shots on the day were done at 1/8000 sec, f/1.4, ISO 50.  This is unmodified light from the Anova Pro 2. This surprised even me y'all. The day is here when LED strobes are approaching the power threshold for use in every scenario.... For more information and for a discount code please visit www.jasonlanier.com/rotolight.

Overpowering the Sun...and the Crazy...today was an epic shoot with the one and only Ms. Maddi Dewalt in London.  We had an entire film crew there, drones, etc on an antique Lightship Boat that we rented. For the first time ever I shot with a Rotolight product and was able to overpower the sun at midday with no diffusion while using the Anova Pro 2. I can not WAIT for you to see it.... Stay tuned.  Here's a production shot from today.  Thanks again to Maddi for killing it and for Rod Gammons and Rotolight for putting it all together!!! Tomorrow are two appearances at @wexphotovideo and then my photo walk.  Wanna join me?

The Sun Goddess- my portrait and landscape shoot of the Total Solar Eclipse...new video released!  You can check out how I captured this by clicking below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2rR0oyVxzk&t=58s Please note: this image posted here is a composite.  I'm posting it because many watching the video have requested to see what a composite would look like from this shoot. This was a once in a lifetime event and was completely surreal.  This has video footage of the eclipse, landscape shots of the eclipse that were featured on Sony Alpha, and portrait shots done during the eclipse with the @rotolight Aeos. And the video features the great @lalunetta I hope you like it!!

Capturing the Spirit of Cinefuegos...just got to this amazing place after leaving Havana this morning.  Such a different feel and vibe and I love experiencing everything from the crazy busy city to the quiet Oceanside city in Cinefuegos. This handsome man offered me the opportunity to capture his image...and I was more than willing to do so...:) This is with the Sony A7Riii using the Petzval lens.  So far this trip I’ve gone full manual for some reason...only using the Petzval and it’s been fun to take a step back from the technology in a place that’s taken the step back as well... I can’t wait to share more with all of you!!! Cuba Adventure Round 2 is coming yall...stay tuned for details. Next up on my calendar is London the end of this month and beginning of next.

How to Set Up Your Sony A7iii...and other Sony Mirrorless Cameras..new video released!  Click below to watch it now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82l5Z-bvUc I've been asked a lot over the years how I set up, customize and Jasonize my Sony cameras.  Well, with the release of the A7iii I've been getting this question a LOT.  And since so many people are starting to receive them I thought now would be a great time to show you what I do! This video contains a complete look into the menu, the custom buttons, the function button and more.  I also tell you all of the settings and features that I use for my work. I hope it helps, and make sure to leave a comment to let us know what you like to do to personalize your camera bodies.... Thanks!

A big thanks to @aspenm_ for assisting, to the beautiful models @lovelysierrra, @aubreegambs and @dacia for shooting with us as well as @quishamothershed for helping out behind the scenes.

Remember this crap?  Lol how nice to just use Auto White Balance...for the relics out there like me we can use a Grey card if we really wanna be precise... I have pretty much bought EVERYTHING out there which is why I try to give you all a heads up on gear...lol 🎩💆‍♀️💆🏿‍♂️ Btw my emojis make no sense they were just funny to me.. #jasonlanier #expodisc

Old Man McGee- for my millenial followers out there this is called a Shutter Release Cable- this is the equivalent of walking to and from school, both ways uphill in snow compared to the technology we have today....

My First LOVE- this was my first ever camera that I bought in my Junior year in High School...I did a paper route for years and saved up all of that money to buy the Nikon N5005 at Ritz Camera... Y’all remember Ritz??? I was so excited when I bought this.  I seriously had a Santa Maria Guadalupe moment! Wow the memories that I have with this guy are EPIC.  Shooting my girlfriend and her friends for weekend shoots where I did my best to pretend to be a pro lol. I took this thing with me to Korea for 2 years where I annoyed everyone around me because my head was always behind the viewfinder capturing what I was seeing... This camera found its way to shoot my future wife for our school projects...the stories this thing could tell would be #crazy... I’ll always have love for Nikon...it’s part of my legacy and my past...and it’s why I’ll always have this camera.. And as you can tell I’ve always made my cameras work for me lol...😂 Having fun Spring Cleaning!!!! #jasonlanier #nikon #n5005 #film #sonyartisanofimagery #jasonlanierphotography

Bridal Fairs- are truly the key to jump starting a wedding photography business...IF you do them the right way.... I’m spring cleaning now and finding some gems 💎 back from when I used to do them...this is circa 2012 or so...great memories!!! This is a handout I would give to Brides....and then I’d use my gift of gab and my work to book them.  I really had some success at these shows..you just gotta know how to do them..:) #bridalfair #jasonlanierphotography #photography #sonyartisanofimagery #weddingphotography

Alter Ego- as the Spring Cleaning continues I keep finding some cool artifacts from my previous life as a Hotel Executive.  This is from my time as a Director at the Laguna Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, one of the most memorable hotels I ever worked at! I was still in my twenties when I won this award...it just goes to show you that you never know where life will take you...especially if you open yourself up to opportunities and pursue them vigorously when you have the chance. I have no doubt that my hotel experience has contributed to where I am today.  So if you aren’t where you wanna be, look at this time as your prep time for something bigger...but only if you’re willing to work for it... NEVER give up on your dreams my friends...:) #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #sonyartisanofimagery #photographer

Seeking Light- this is from a shoot I did at the end of last year in Los Angeles with the stunning Nicole Rose.  This was all natural light at a photo studio.  Many times windows that are a little dirty can actually provide beautiful diffused light...I use the technique frequently when I shoot in abandoned buildings... This was with the Sony A7Riii using the 85mm Canon L lens with the Sigma MC 11 Adapter. We have a lot of amazing locations coming up this year including London, Seattle, Dallas, North Carolina, Virginia, Cayman Islands, San Francisco and more... if you'd like to join us please visit www.jasonlanier.com/register today!

My FIRST Wedding- we are doing a bit of Spring cleaning over here at Fedora HQ and I found my first ever print from my first wedding that I used for bridal fairs etc.  this is circa 2007 of the beautiful Brittany, my first wedding client. Crazy where we are at today!  Never give up on your dreams my friends.  I am so grateful to Brittany and Greg for choosing me 11 years ago to document their big day.  Don’t know where my life would be if I didn’t shoot that wedding... #nevergiveuponyourdreams #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #nikon #weddingphotography #beginnings

Getting Personal- this week was truly a blast as it’s the first time I’ve done two 1 on 1 training sessions in the same week! This one was done down in Oceanside with my main man @anthonycalderonphotography where the beautiful @aspenm_ came through for us as a gorgeous model. A big thanks to my team for helping out including @quishamothershed, @q88photography and @alexthirteenth.  This was taken on the pier using the @rotolight  Aeos.  It’s also where we found out that Miss @aspenm_ has a slight fear of heights...lol she chose an interesting job and boss who doesn’t really have fear 😂 Thanks to Anthony for choosing us to help you take your photography to the next level.  Every single 1 on 1 session is tailored and made custom for the client...so each one is different which makes it so fun for me... Next up for me is Cuba with my family!!! #jasonlanierphotography #jasonlanier #oceanside #photographytraining #1on1 #portraits #pier #ocean #rotolight #aeos #masteroflight #sonyartisanofimagery

Training the man who knows love better than anyone else...today I had the distinct pleasure of doing a 1 on 1 training session for @nicholassparks, the author of classics like the Notebook and so many other amazing books that have been turned into movies. He was such a cool guy and we shared a ton of laughs along with his friend Vicky. I think what I love the most about training people is watching them improve so quickly to help them achieve the goals that they have for their photography.  By the end of the session his shots were looking fantastic. A big thanks to my crew for all of their amazing help today.  Couldn’t have done it without you guys! To book your own 1 on 1 session hit us up at jason@jlpros.com today! Thank you Nicholas!! #jasonlanier #nicholassparks #jasonlanierphotography #venicebeach #1on1personaltraining #1on1 #sonyartisanofimagery

Practicing What I Preach- the beautiful @aspenm_ was busy posing with another photographer during the Tokyo workshop and workshop attendee @kimwrightpix asked me to help her fix her pose that she showed me of what she'd shot earlier with Aspen. So I sat on the bench and helped her figure out the pose.  I love the shot...Great job Kim!!! Next workshop is London!

Investing in my Sons Future- I just bought my three boys their own A6000's as an official start to their photography careers....I'm so excited for them! PS...don't tell them.  It's a secret..:) . We are going to Cuba as a family later this month and that will be their first photography journey... Let the training begin!! #sonyartisanofimagery #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #fatherson #teach #a6000 #mirrorless

Models in the Making- a pic I took in Portrait mode using natural light with the iPhone 8 Plus of my sons today after they finished a 3 day Trek adventure.  This was shot in the back of the parking lot and I tried to use some trees to make it more natural looking lol.. I’m training them as photographers but they could make it as models right? I’m telling you camera phones are getting better and better...I’m not crazy y’all...if you don’t maximize your professional gear your shots won’t look any different than what people are doing with their phones. Yes I know how to place them in the right light and pose them better than most camera phone picture takers will.  And yes, I was shooting intentionally when the sun was being diffused by a cloud...but I was also being a normal Dad and just using my cellphone to snap shots of them when I picked them up earlier today. I love these dudes.  Movies tonight! #jasonlanier #iphone #8plus #jasonlanierphotography #trek

Thank you TOKYO!  I honestly had such an amazing time here in Japan and can’t thank the workshop attendees enough for coming to join me for the Cherry Blossom Festival!

Shooting the streets of Tokyo at my workshop here using the @rotolight Aeos with the Sony A9.  This is straight out of the camera of the stunning @aspenm_ who is just remarkable.  This is with the 85mm G Master lens. I can’t wait to share more videos and pics with her.

Visiting Sony HQ!  It wasn’t an April Fools joke...today I visited Sony HQ in Tokyo and was greeted by 40 Sony engineers waiting to speak with me for 2 hours regarding their cameras. They wanted first hands real feedback on how the cameras perform in the field and what can make them even better. I’m humbled that I get opportunities like this one where I get to experience so many different aspects of the photography industry.  A HUGE thanks to Sony for setting this up and accommodating my visit here.  I can’t wait to do it again..:) #jasonlanier #sonyartisanofimagery #tokyo #sony

Modification Straight out of the PHONE...I took this today with my iPhone Plus 8 and I didn’t use any portrait mode or anything...just a normal shot. I took it to show how I modify my @rotolight products because I have people asking and this is faster than doing a video lol. There are a TON of options out there.  All you need in an umbrella bracket and you’re off to the races.  You have more options available to you that way than even using Bowens mount adapters y’all. This is the @rotolight Aeos inside of the @westcottlighting 48 inch Apollo Orb.  The lighting is superb. The model is my very handsome son Michael.  As you can see, the skies the limit when you open your mind...:) It’s a new lighting world out there my friends...embrace it and blow away your competition...

Like Father Like Sons...the boys specifically asked for rings so they could look like their Dad...so after a little trip to @swarovski they joined my ring club.  It’s an exclusive club for just me and my boys... Something for them to remember me always when I’m on the road... #boytime #jasonlanier #swarovski

Three Pompadours and a Fedora...Boy Day continues!! I love old school barbers like @thee_traditional_barbershop and so do my boys.  It’s usually the first thing they ask me to do when I return home.  And I love getting the straight razor done there on my head and beard.  Feels FABULOUS! #jasonlanier #haircut

One handing the BEAST- I had a workshop attendee named Jonathon Stynes ask me to shoot with his Canon using the 200mm f/2.  So I was happy to oblige... Now, I was able to hold it, but not shoot with it because well...you kinda need the whole active Live View of the Sony’s to pull this off...:) I had a great time in Derby and can’t wait to come back to London in 5 weeks!!

Last nights shoot at our 4 day boot camp was terrific.  It was a bonus shoot we did after finishing the editing session and @jade.gallowayy killed it as usual.

BLOWN AWAY by the love extended to me at the @thephotographyshow here in Birmingham, UK!  This was my last presentation on the Live Stage doing action photography.  It was a blast and I can’t wait to do it again.  Thanks to @rotolight for making so much of this experience possible! I have a workshop in Derby from the 21-24, a photo walk in Dublin on the 25th and then I go home before heading off to Japan in early April.  I can’t wait!  I’ll be back in the UK late April early May for a workshop and other events..:) #jasonlanier #thephotoshow #nec #birmingham #rotolight #masteroflight #sonyartisanofimagery

Always Honored and Humbled...when I walk into a convention and see one of my pics on the wall. There’s something so neat about seeing something you created come to life.  For me I remember the exact place, the weather, what was going on etc....it’s a very real experience for me which is why I love seeing the pics.  A BIG thank you to Sony for displaying it! I’m having a great time here at @thephotographyshow and can’t wait for all of my events to begin! I’ll be at the Mobile and Social Media stage at noon, the @rotolight booth at 2, and the Live stage next to the Rotolight and Canon booths at 4.  I’ll see all of you there!! #thephotoshow #jasonlanier #jasonlanierphotography #rotolight #sony #uk

Ballerinas at the Bonneville Salt Flats....yesterday was a special day at my workshop in Utah with Alyssa Obrien. Absolutely love shooting there with so many memories over the last decade. First we did natural light and then used the Rotolight Anova Pro 2 thanks to it's no recycle time. I've been asked by followers about my A7Riii so I shot with it yesterday to give it some love and I loved it. This is just a quick production BTS shot edited using Lightroom only. For more information on the Anova Pro 2 please visit www.jasonlanier.com/rotolight. Thanks to all who came. I can't wait for Day 2 today!! #jasonlanier #masteroflight #rotolight #anovapro2 #jasonlanierphotography #bonnevillesaltflats #sonyartisanofimagery #a7riii

Commercial shoot in the rain- did an awesome shoot tonight even though it rained for an awesome new sock company that makes Bamboo socks called Rule No. 6.  They really are great socks y’all! I did the shoot entirely with the A7Riii and the 50mm Sony Zeiss using the @rotolight Anova Pro 2.  I didn’t use the a7iii simply because I can’t process raw files with it yet. A big thanks to all who came.  You’ll see these shots for the company soon!! #jasonlanier #sonyartisanofimagery #a7riii #mirrorless #rotolight #anovapro2 #jasonlanierphotography #commercialphotography #venicebeach

Jpeg LOVE?????? Since there are no raw profiles available for the A7iii I'm shooting everything in Raw + Jpeg.  I've always been a pure raw shooter but right now I'm shooting raw so I have them available once the profiles are available. Right now I'm editing and posting with just the jpegs and I gotta be honest with you...I really can't believe the flexibility I have with these files my friends.  This camera has an all new sensor I can believe it. This was shot on my Photo Walk tonight in Vegas using the Rotolight Neo 2. Camera settings: Sony A7iii, 1/80 sec at f/1.4, 50mm at ISO 100.
