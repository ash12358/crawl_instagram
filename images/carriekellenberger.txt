Two timing on Bijoux with Bentley. 😱 Cottage life on Lake Nipissing. Still pretty rundown, but the love and fresh air is helping. :)

This one just doesn't want to work with me. It's ok, but it should be leaning a little more to the left and it's stubborn. I cut the lotus seed many times to try and get it on the right angle.

So this happened. I went to the market to get some soil and my local vendor says she knew I was coming today. She had seven bags of these for her favorite clients. 20 freaking #dragonfruit - bright red inside. I gave 5 to my building staff, but I still have 15 and I'm leaving next week. Guess I will be eating a lot of dragonfruit in the next few days. They help with #inflammation. It's a great #fruit for #arthritis and for GI problems. #foodforarthritis I rely on these heavily every day of the year, I've just never had this many before. I love #Taiwan. Guess I really am flying out on the wings of love from my local friends.  Yes, I bought a bouquet - ones that bloom and die fast. Fleeting but powerful in their honeyed glory.

My love for #Canada and #Taiwan never stops. I'm devastated I can't be at an event that I have helped organized for the past five years, but this is how things go when you never know what your body will do next. 🦄🇨🇦 ..... I am wearing my Canada Day shirt here and madly cheering our amazing CCCT team on today. They are all champions. Despite all the naysayers and trolls, they are out there smiling and ensuring everyone has a great time. ..... To all my colleagues at the #CanadianChamberofCommerceinTaiwan ( #CanCham ) and to my good friends at the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, my hat is off to you. ..... Mad love and respect for all of you. GO CANADA! True patriot love. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦

Back on ice after activity this weekend. Flares within flares. This is a full on #Fibromyalgia #flare and I use the same methods each time for coping with it. Bed rest, legs up and on ice, gentle stretches - but not with my legs because they are numb and too swollen today - painkillers, and distraction techniques - mostly Netflix, books, and art. ____ 🦄Here's a shout out to all of you #chronicillness warriors that are sick today.🦄 ____ My website link is in my bio if you want to visit My Several Worlds and learn more about what I have coped with on a day to day basis since my #AnkylosingSpondylitis diagnosis in February 2009.

I can still touch my toes. I've never lost my hypermobility from my days in gymnastics, but sometimes I think it might be due to something else. Maybe EDS since I shouldn't be able to do some of the things I can still do without practice and considering how broken my body is. ____ Anyways, every night me and B do our leg and back stretches. She wrapped herself up in my pashmina last night and I snapped this photo because she is so cute. ____ Four exercises that I do without fail every single day to avoid falling into my darn #wheelchair completely: Forward bends (sitting or standing), torso twists, chest pops (I pop my sternum as much as possible), and.... getting down and up from the floor!!! This last one is very important because the day I lose the ability to get off the floor is the day I go into my Karma wheelchair for good. That's not going to happen if I have any say about it. ____ What about you?

Thank you for another wonderful meal tonight! ______ My last meal at Naked Food Taipei was bittersweet. I am so happy and full of joy to see you moving on to your next adventure. I hope to be at your side for all future endeavors. A wee bit sad to take my final step out of Naked Food after spending so many joyous times and meals at my favorite restaurant in Taipei, but my heart bursts to see you moving on to the next phase of life. Much love to you, dear friend. I can't wait to see what comes next. (I hope it is a long and well deserved rest!) 💛🧡💛

Spirited Away. 22/100 This was so much fun to play with. It reminds me a bit of a dandelion blowing seeds in the wind. (Larger in life and in #purple naturally.)

Way way way back machine. 😂 January 2004. Koh Samui. I'm around 30 years old in this photo. Wish I knew what I was reading that day. ___ I remember John wanting to do something that afternoon and I didn't want to stop reading. We ended up at The Cliff Bar and Grill to see the sunset. That was the first time John really surprised me for a fancy date night.

Adams/K-Berg family mashup Part 4. From Taipei to San Diego and back to Taipei. I met Sara through travel blogging many many years ago, and when she suggested we meet up in Taipei back in early 2014, it was instant friendship. We love these guys, and we're so happy we got a chance to see them last night for sushi and the dessert at Ice Monster. I hope  we don't have to wait until 2.5 years to see them again. If I had my way, we'd spend much more time with these amazing friends. 🦄🦄🦄

Keeping things real on MySeveralWorlds.com. ___ Never Did I Ever Think... features things that I never thought would happen when I got sick 10 years ago. ____ Examples: 1. That I would lose my health completely. 2. That I would need a wheelchair. (Although I suspected in 2015) 3. That I would be in pain constantly. 4. That I would lose people in my life because they can't understand or deal with a friend who has been ill for years. 5. That I don't know how to explain what is wrong with me now because there is so much wrong; I feel helpless and don't know where to start... ___ And many other gems about: #chronicillness #chronicpain #disabled #Spoonie #AnkylosingSpondylitis #Fibromyalgia #MECFS #invisibleillness #MySeveralWorlds #CarrieKellenberger #spoonieproblems #mentalhealth #chroniclife #disability #sorrow #selfworth #sickgirl #chronicblogs #awareness

He's from corn country, but he passed on the corn popsicles! I don't understand. I thought kids from Iowa love everything related to corn! We got blue soda 'pops' instead. (I've never seen a kid eat as many popsicles as this one does.) Yeesh.

I get quite a few of advance copies through my line of work, but never with a really sweet letter from the authors themselves! ___ This shout out goes to @sewingstephanie since I've likely been giving her other half more attention than I should. Sorry, Stephanie. Love you, girl. I'm so proud of you! 🦄🦄🦄 ___ It's really too bad I'm sick this weekend and have nothing to do but read and review, right @josambro?

This was one of the most emotional events I've been to in a very long time. Pierre had me in tears within five minutes of his speech. Not a dry eye in the house. Some of you might know about my work with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan (CCCT). I don't mention my work much online because this part of my life doesn't need recognition. My involvement with the Chamber started in 2014 and it is a huge part of my life. The only reason we have official representation for Canada in Taiwan is because of this man, Mr. Pierre Loisel Sr. He founded The Canadian Society in 1983. The Canadian Trade Office was established afterwards, and in 2013, The Canadian Society turned into the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan. It was my honor to serve as Chairwoman of the CCCT in 2016-2018. Now I serve on its Supervisory Board and we help to create a community for the 70,000+ Canadians in Taiwan. It was also my great honor to open our official national day celebration for Canada Day last year on July 1st, Canada's 150th birthday, WITH Pierre. He is a legend in Taiwan. Many of us would not be here if not for him and his family's contributions to Taiwan. What is even more important to me, though, is that Pierre is my friend. A very dear friend. Tonight we celebrated his life and his extraordinary achievements. 'Impossible' is not in his vocabulary. He is phenomenal. That is why we call him The Loisel Legend. Thank you, Pierre. My life is rich with love for having you, Sue, and your family in our lives. We love you.

K-BUB in the house. FINALLY! He's here and he's already made himself at home next to me and my marker box. Super jet-lagged, but he's handling it well. He has also crossed the International Date Line four times on his own! He has traveled to more places at age 13 than most adults I know. Little man is way bigger than me now. I didn't walk today. I stayed in bed all day. :)

So the day I got home from the hospital, a box for a hair appliance arrived in the mail. I'm looking at the box and thinking, 'A hair appliance?' Odd. I don't have much hair left after all the meds. It was packed with metallic Sharpies and markers from my friend Christoper Young! Best box ever! What a sweet pot of gold! Perfect timing. Wednesday was truly a rotten day, but this was a moment of joy amongst the chaos. Thank you so much! 🦄💙

Homemade Rose Water I made rose water spray for the first day of 100 days of art to help me get through the summer heat. It turned out really well. This can be used all over your body or on your face for a toner and refresher. 1. Take all the petals off your fading roses. 2. Rinse the residue off them in lukewarm eater. 3. Boil them in distilled water until they are blanched. 4. Strain the petals out until you have pure rose water. 5. Add more distilled water and a few drops of an essential oil that you've tested on your skin in diluted water in advance. 6. Lavender, jasmine, and rose oils all work well for this project. 7.I added a few drops of jasmine oil because it is my favorite essential oil and it's super girly. 8. Put it in a spray bottle and keep it chilled in your fridge. 9. Spritz it on your face or body every day. It helps with evening out skin tone, rosacea, acne, eczema, PLUS: antidepressant, antiseptic, antispasmodic, antiviral, aphrodisiac, astringent, and anti bacterial. Completely natural. BE A ROSE. #100daysofart #100daychallenge #roses #DIY

An empty wheelchair means I'm not in it! I'm standing to take this photo. 😇 Not doing much today. Last week was a big week and I'm paying for it today by just not moving much. This flare feels like it might go for a few days so we'll see what happens for these last three days of Walk Your AS Off 2018. I'm hoping to get three more photos of me on my feet before the 31st! @walkasoneworldwide #aswalkselfie #aswalkselfieTaiwan #WalkASOne #Taiwan #chronicpain #spondywarrior #arthritis #Wheelchair #TheWalkingSpondies #NewTaipei #MySeveralWorlds #wheelchairwarrior #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #awarenessmatters

Just a few days left to go before Walk Your AS Off 2018 ends. I didn't get very far today, but I got a few steps in for AS awareness. TIRED.

Say hello to Lynne and three cheers for her for just completing the Million Step Challenge on May 23, 2018. I am so very happy for her! I am not the only team member with The Walking Spondies with AS. Lynn is a team member of The Walking Spondies and she also has AS! We are walking for Lynne, but she just showed all of us that nothing is impossible. Lynne has been walking with us since 2015 and she has made progress every year. Truly, I could not be any happier for someone than I am for Lynne right now. LYNNE is a unicorn and an AS Warrior. <3 I'm hoping to bring you a few more Faces of AS that are walking with The Walking Spondies so you can see I am not alone.

This beauty is in full bloom now. The roses gave it a pop of color and contrast nicely with my new gunmetal grey platter from Yingge. John didn't think it was deep enough, but it's perfect. The roses faded just as the lilies burst into bloom. Tomorrow I'll post a slightly different photo with it all filled in. I'm impressed with the Dusty Miller. It has really lasted a long time. It has held up beautifully. #dustymiller #silver #lilies #pink #beauty #roses  #pinkroses #Flowers #pottery #nature #sunshine #flowerstyle #ikebanaflowers #ikebanaarrangement #ikebana #arttherapy #artforarthritis #flowerarrangements #greenleaves #Yingge #NewTaipei #artisan #artist #balance #lush #blooms #symmetry #flowermania #MySeveralWorlds #carriekellenberger

This is my best friend Claire and her fiance John in Manchester. Claire formed a mini team for The Walking Spondies and got her colleagues to walk with her. This post is for them.

So here we have two of our Million Steppers on The Walking Spondies team in Taipei. Sam and Rex both rang the Million Step Bell this month. This is a photo from November 2017 just after Sam's life saving surgery - her rebirth as Titanium Girl. A week before that she had a broken neck and we had no idea if she would walk again. This is family, guys. These are the folks that are there for us when we need them most. The folks who are willing to catch us when we fall, whether it's in person or online. Every moment is precious. Live life to the fullest. STAND TALL.

I might have to rethink Mondays and call them REXdays instead!!! I hated Mondays until I found out Rex is the third Walking Spondie to cross The Million Step Challenge finish line. 🦄 Rex is a dedicated marathon runner and much too modest about his accomplishments. His next marathon destination is coming up soon. We are cheering him on now for completing this challenge and I will be cheering him on at his next race! #marathonmachine Walk AS One / Walk Your A.S.

SuperHubs surprised me with a trip today to Yingge (pottery town) in New Taipei. Yingge is not wheelchair friendly, so I walked and rode to make sure I stayed within my step limit. I have some new things to use with my arrangements! Got a little sun too, but I'm exhausted after just two hours of being out. Btw, cobblestone streets ARE NOT fun in a wheelchair. Plus most of the shops that were wheelchair friendly had blocked the access ramps, so they didn't get my business. We bought from the shops that are wheelchair friendly. :) @walkasoneworldwide #aswalkselfie #aswalkselfieTaiwan #WalkASOne #spondywarrior #arthritis #TheWalkingSpondies #NewTaipei #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs

@walkasoneworldwide Susan Edwards is almost 3/4 the way to achieving a million steps. Susan opted this day to walk with a load (ie golf clubs), just to make things interesting. Coincidentally, the walk was on a golf course and she also played 9 holes. Here she is with team member Diana King.

Here it is with the whole bottom filled in. It turned out just like I pictured it in my mind. Living art - Ikebana - The art of Japanese flower arranging. Art therapy for arthritis. Stargazer lilies, deep pink carnations, some long green leaves, and some dark green eight pointed lily leaves have made my heart a little lighter today. #ikebana #arttherapy #artforarthritis #flowerarrangements #florals #zen #nature #beauty #blush #blooms #lilies #stargazerlilies #carnations #darkpinkcarnations #Japaneseculture #nature #indoorgarden #art

Captain Marshall reporting for duty. She can hold my world up in her hands because she's my mom. Just having a little fun with editor to make #SuperMom laugh a little. Four years with The Walking Spondies. I know it is hard to have a sick child so far away from you, but you know I love you and your strength keeps me going.

These silver green leaves are so weird. They feel like velvet. I've never seen them before so if anyone can identify them, I'd love to know what they are. Pastels and hot blooms. I feel like I am back in the 80s. :) Living art - Ikebana - The art of Japanese flower arranging. Art therapy for arthritis. White roses, deep pink carnations, minty green leaves, and some dark green eight pointed lily leaves. #ikebana #arttherapy #artforarthritis #flowerarrangements #florals #zen #nature #beauty #blush #blooms #lilies #mint #roses #whiteroses #carnations #darkpinkcarnations #Japaneseculture #nature #indoorgarden #art #beauty

This is team member and Coach Diana King with Coach Nancy Mills at my high school gym in Carleton Place, Ontario. Diana was the second person to complete the Million Step Challenge for #WalkYourASOff. I can't tell you how many hours I spent in this gym. My dad was Head of the PE Department. I grew up in this gym from childhood through to high school. All sports, all the time. These two ladies are two of the best coaches in Lanark County! Hometown pride to see my former teachers and coaches walking to raise awareness for Ankylosing Spondylitis.

These might be my new favorite flowers to work with. So many combinations that look beautiful. Living art - Ikebana - The art of Japanese flower arranging. Art therapy for arthritis. Stargazer lilies, white roses, deep pink carnations, some long green leaves, and some dark green eight pointed lily leaves have made my heart a little lighter today. This arrangement is on my desk at home. #ikebana #arttherapy #artforarthritis #flowerarrangements #florals #zen #nature #beauty #blush #blooms #lilies #stargazerlilies #roses #whiteroses #carnations #darkpinkcarnations #Japaneseculture #nature #indoorgarden #art

Not feeling great today. I haven't eaten much, but when my husband offered to take me to the local flower market, I said YES to the steps. I didn't get many steps in today, but some is better than none. 👣👣👣 The market is hidden underneath an overpass in New Taipei. That entrance right behind me is filled with beauty and it's just a few blocks from my home. I spend a lot of time here. It's also a good place to practice Chinese. @walkasoneworldwide #aswalkselfie #aswalkselfieTaiwan #spondywarrior #Taiwan #arthritis #TheWalkingSpondies #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #WalkASOne

Guess how many Million Step Challengers are in this photo? There are also TWO Spartan Racers from that morning in this photo! The Walking Spondies had their 4th annual park picnic on World AS Day - May 5, 2018 Blue sneakers, blue shirts, blue picnic blankets, blue cookies, blue Doritos and blue flowers. Our team goal was 150,000 steps and we crushed it. @walkasoneworldwide #myfriendsarethebest #spondyfriends #aswalkselfie #aswalkselfieTaiwan #spondywarrior #Taiwan #arthritis #TheWalkingSpondies #thankyou #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #spartanrace #WalkASOne

When your mom and dad host an AS theme party even though you aren't there, and your mom has team t-shirts made for The Walking Spondies and for Walk Your AS Off, and then the whole team logs 120,000+ steps and CRUSHES their team step goal for that day...

World Ankylosing Spondylitis Day in Taipei, Taiwan. We all raise awareness together. Every year this event brings in new friends who don't know about AS.

I confess that this was not much of a walk. I'm moving slow, but I'm on my feet and rocking my blue Havaianas. I walk for watermelon juice. Taiwan is a flip flop nation. No one knows how to paint either. :) That blue wall and half the sidewalk have been freshly painted for the MRT station.

I'm posting for my mom and Co-Captain of The Walking Spondies (Sandi Marshall) for @walkASoneworldwide selfie challenge because she does not have Instagram. She's so cute. Love you, Mom. Looking forward to your team walk photos from today. This is her April step count. She's taking the Million Step Challenge again. She's already done it twice.

I think it's funny that my image is complete in my Instagram feed on some days (image on the left) and then turns to an image of a girl in pieces. (Image on the right). It's rather fitting for my AS life. Some days I am whole and some days I don't feel put together at all. It describes my life with AS perfectly. Walk Your AS Off starts tomorrow.

Blue Princess Party for one in bed. Nah, I don't hang out in bed in princess gowns despite what some of you might think. As a Professional Bed Sitter, I like my DIY projects. :) More blue for Ankylosing Spondylitis Awareness Month. Walk Your AS Off starts on May 1st. Half our team has been chugging away all through April for the Million Step Challenge. The rest of us - including me - start on May 1st. Our first team event is on May 2nd in Carleton Place, Ontario with my Co-Captain and Supermom, Sandi Marshall. She's marching with half the teachers from my high school. Hometown pride. THE WALKING SPONDIES are chomping at the bit and ready to cut loose to raise awaremess for Ankylosing Spondylitis! #spondywarrior #BLUE #Taiwan #CarrieKellenberger #walkyourASoff2018 #WalkASOne #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #TheWalkingSpondies #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs

They are two of three friends that I allow in my home, especially when I am sick and can't get out of bed. They know everything about me. They get it. They understand it. They help me, encourage me, and are always there when I am falling. Fiercely protective and two of the best gals in the world. On occasion, they have both been over when I've been bedridden and have just sat quietly with me. Very blessed to have them in my life. If a chronically ill gal needs pals, these are the two to have. They make the shitty parts about illness so much better. My family away from home. #AnkylosingSpondylitis #Fibromyalgia #CFSME #chronicallyillabroad #bestfriends #family #chronicillness #invisibleillness #spondywarrior #Spoonie

I missed my blue post yesterday due to a Grey Day, which I also refer to as a Missing Day. These days pop up when my CFS/ME is in hyperdrive. This is what #myalgicencephalomyelitis (also referred to as #chronicfatiguesyndrome ) does to me. I go missing for a while. It's like being between two worlds: The land of the living and the land of death. I'm there, but not there. I'm aware, but not aware. I lost about 36 hours total to this and it happens fairly frequently. There is no talking, no light, no sound, no external stimuli. All of that makes it worse. Hyper sensitive to everything. We couldn't even open the curtains until close to 4pm. Pain is there, but the primary symptom is crushing and debilitating fatigue. I never have the energy to sit up or eat. I just hover in between both worlds in a grey daze. My husband knows to leave me in quiet and bring me food if I can manage to eat, but we basically just wait it out. I'm still feeling it today, but at least I got out of bed today. #spondywarrior #BLUE #MECFS #AnkylosingSpondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness  #chroniclife #fatigue #myaslife #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #fatigue #PTSD #wellnessblogger #healthblogger #TheWalkingSpondies #myseveralworlds #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #healthadvocacy #brainfog #cfsfighter #cfs #ME #healthadvocacy #crushingfatigue #millionsmissing

The world is in my hands. It's in your hands too. Can you see Taiwan? 🇹🇼 I bought this handmade Christmas ornament in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam many years ago and I keep it in my room.

Keeping in theme with blue for April which is Ankylosing Spondylitis Awareness Month. I found these handblown glass flowers in Kaohsiung, Taiwan I'm not sure what I will do with them, but they'll be worked into some sort of an art project. Right now they are sitting in my window and catching the sunshine. Maybe a suncatcher for my window?

What super sick looked like (for me) in 2015 with a kitten. (Still super sick. Things haven't changed.) We became fast friends. She was too tiny to jump and I was too sick to move. Such is life. Still besties. No idea what I would do without Bijoux. We still sleep together, hand to paw. I don't mind sharing my pillow with her.

One month of blue photos to raise awareness for a devastating disease that hits 1 in every 100 individuals. #ankylosingspondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #blue #myseveralworlds #carriekellenberger #healthadvocate #healthadvocacy

Going BLUE for AnkylosingSpondylitis awareness month. This is a quote from my site My Several Worlds. I launched MSW in Jan 2007 as a travel website for Asia, but as my worlds expanded to include the countries I visited, I had to make room for another world I live in: The world of being chronically ill. I've been sick for years now. Ankylosing Spondylitis was just the first world to open for me on this journey. www.myseveralworlds/carrie-kellenberger/ Visit the link above to see my quote in action along with my mission statement for the site. I live in many worlds. This is why I named my site My Several Worlds. :) #ankylosingspondylitis #chronicillness #chronicpain #invisibleillness #spondylitis #AS #chroniclife #fatigue #butyoudontlooksick #autoimmune #ASwarrior #Spoonie #SpoonieProbs #blue #myseveralworlds #carriekellenberger #healthadvocate #healthadvocacy

"Dragonfly out in the sun, You know what I mean, don't you know?" April is Ankylosing Spondylitis Awareness Month. I got my Sunday steps in today in the sun and took my #blue photo for #AnkylosingSpondylitis awareness. Great pizza, btw. We'll be back. #dragonfly #tattoo #tinytattoo #bluebracelet #wharf #pier #chroniclife #Spoonie Tattoo by @themanyao :)

An old modeling photo from 2004 #Blue for #AnkylosingSpondylitis and for our AS angels among us. There is before I was sick and after I was sick.

I'm not a glitter on roses kinda gal. Nature should be left to it's own beauty, but it's blue and sparkly and fits with this month's photo theme. Going #BLUE for #ankylosingspondylitis Awareness Month. (APRIL) Thanks to @diamonds_bt for this lovely bouquet that Sam and I enjoyed. I had no idea you would be there today, otherwise I would've come. (Was also told 2pm, not noon. Sorry bud. I miss you. I hope to see you soon!) #roses #flowers #bouquets #bouquetstoart #nature #beauty #rosebouquet #blueroses #howifeeltoday

More #blue for #ankylosingspondylitis awareness month. In which I paint a #warrior rock and place it with my blue #Kindle cover. Rocking today, not walking... >_<

My second arrangement of the month was easy. The pale pink pom pom crysanthemum snapped off on my way home, so I filled my dragonfly teapot with a different kind of love today - flowers, not tea! This is all I had for strength anyways. Zero energy to do anything today. Two days into this #flare. Channel the pain into something sweet to look at and hope it passes soon. THIS CHRONIC LIFE CAN BITE ME! :) #ikebanaflowers #ikebana #ikebanaarrangements #livingart #chroniclife #teapot #crysanthemums #pompomcrysanthemums #pink #greenleaves #green #burgundy #dianthus #arttherapy #dragonfly #flowers #florals

My husband thinks my winter #birkenstocks are ugly, but I love these comfty #blue indoor #shoes Most of us #Spoonie people with active disease activity can't walk barefoot because we are in so much pain all the time. I used to walk barefoot all the time! Birks are my favorite go to shoe for #indoor and outdoor use. I always go as bright and as fun as possible for indoor use. Quite a few of us turn to Birks for comfort and reliabilty. They last for years. Wish I could feel the ground beneath my feet again. Going #BLUE for #ankylosingspondylitis awareness month. :) My #chroniclife. #SpoonieProbs

Going #BLUE for #ankylosingspondylitis awareness month. I'm going to try and focus on blue this month. I finally got the #geode #bookends I've been wanting for a while. #bookworms for life. This is how you show your books off. (Geodes are cool to look at, by the way. You can get lost in them.)

April means new flowers. Here is my first arrangement for the month. I called it 'A Hot Mess' because it doesn't follow any rules. (I'm a hot mess today too. Not feeling well at all. My body feels like it is on fire so I tried to emulate that feeling with this arrangement.) #spoonieprobs #ankylosingspondylitis I really like it though. Although #untraditional, it makes me smile. #ikebana #ikebanaflowers #flowers #freesia #yellowfreesia #flowerarrangement #livingart #red #yellow #green #black #peony #wangpeony #indoorgarden #beauty #nature #florallife #florals #innocence #thoughtfulness #trust #friendship

The last arrangement for March 2018. This is what was left over from my purchase at the beginning of March. Knowing your flowers and plants and how long they last really helps to extend through the month. #ikebana #ikebanaflowers #flowers #livingart #flowerarrangement #dianthus #pompomcrysanthemums #crysanthemums #orchids #purpleorchid #purple #green #greenleaves #nature #indoorgarden #beauty #instagramflowers

Surprise! A new #butterfly awareness tattoo for #ankylosingspondylitis by Man Yao, an LA tattoo artist with the Jess Yen family of artists. This is my third #tattoo by Man. I've gone to the #Kaohsiung Tattoo Convention twice to have him work on me. This year was the 9th Annual Tattoo Convention. (I have six tattoos, all birds, winged things, and flowers.) Man can do anything, but his dot work tattoos are very special. This one is tiny and intricrate. No longer than my finger. I love it. April is Ankylosing Spondylitis Awareness month, so I'm ready to bring it!

My next art project? I love the concept and I was able to break the components down to five supplies for construction. Bulbs, balls, wire, crimps, and hooks.

Here it is in better light. I loved it against the dark wood, but it really pops on the corner of my work desk. A Walk on the Wild Side. Something to stick my face in. This doesn't follow any rules but my own.
