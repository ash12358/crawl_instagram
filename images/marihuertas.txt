#fivethingsfriday, Cape Cod edition: 1. I'm disconnecting for a much-needed vacation and celebration with family. üåÖ 2. No laptops allowed, none brought. 3. In my first hours here, I walked toward the edge of low tide and saw rippling sands, burrowing snails, reclining waters. The sun held me warmly and loosened my shoulders. 4. These things matter. 5. No matter where I am -- the ocean calls me home. The tide is a lullaby.

#fivethingsfriday 1. My son doesn't talk much yet, which weighs on me, but he loves to make art. His teacher is proud of him and shows off his work and shares stories of how he created each piece. I'm proud of him, too. 2. I razored off more of my hair, so it's off my neck now. I'm going to undercut it next. The ease of it all: breathe, breathe. 3. Maybe it's age, maybe it's clarity, maybe both -- but I want to feel like myself 1000% of the time. Messy short hair and tattoos (soon!) and easy, dark clothes do that for me. And I knew this in college, but, regrettably, I walked away from it. Never again. 4. This has been a hard week. I tell myself I can grieve someone I've never met -- that I can give into my humanity, and move through the echo I've experienced. It feels sad, but also not alone, and that seems a good way to feel. 5. I'll keep moving.

#fivethingsfriday 1. Thinking about needs vs wants and feeling satisfied in some ways, hungry in others. 2. How would it feel to slow down? To stand taller? To walk with my rib cage opened with air, expanded with breath? 3. I will never stop examining things. 4. I will always Do The Work. 5. It isn't always Work.

#fivethingsfriday (one day late) 1. I want to make a big change, but I'm not sure of its shape yet. I just know the current situation is not maintainable. 2. I made an appointment to get my hair cut short(er). I feel like I'm craving lightness and freedom of movement. Somehow short(er) hair helps me feel that. 3. It might also be a control thing. 4. My mind chews through words and thoughts I want to capture and shape, but when I finally have the kid down to nap or sleep, I have no engine to document them. I have to work on that. But also be kind to myself on the way. 5. What would you do with an extra hour of time each day?

#fivethingsfriday, birthday edition 1. 39, feeling fine. 2. This is the year I feel closest to myself, in earnest, and it is a blessing. 3. Normally I take my birthday off work. I had to ship a major project this year, so I'm on deck -- and birthday dinner plans were somewhat foiled -- but my team brought me donuts and succulents and balloons, and my husband gave me peonies, and I'm going to have pizza and cuddle up at home with my family tonight, and that's a damn fine way of appreciating being alive. 4. Coming in my new year: getting my first tattoo, publishing my first book of @19syllables poetry, reading and writing more, practicing a deeper and more consistent loving kindness. 5. I can't wait to hit 40.

#fivethingsfriday 1. California, you beautiful monster. 2. Spending more time learning and developing myself, reading, thinking. Education is a renewed high priority. No one else will make it one for me. 3. Empathy is the shortest bridge to making a new friend and renewing strong bonds with current ones. 4. Exploration is a series of small steps that, upon reflection, appear to be a great leap. 5. All eyes on this: ‚ÄúTell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?‚Äù --Mary Oliver

#fivethingsfriday 1. First thunderstorms of the season. 2. Sky like the gray downy feathers of a bird's wing. 3. Music sashaying through open windows, all hip-popping muscle. 4. Laughter in a momentary flash through ice cream bites. 5. Summer. In Chicago. City of life. ü¶ã

#fivethingsfriday 1. I went shorter. Thx, @brad.ho.hair, for the amazing cut ‚Äì I love it. üíï 2. Shedding all the layers and doing serious spring cleaning. Opening house and heart. Looking for new opportunities for expansiveness in almost every way. 3. Family and friends joined us for dinner on Thursday night, and I watched the sun settle into its golden hour through my dining room windows. It cast warm light on my son squeaking happily as everyone chased him through the house, roaring and singing and stomping, and I thought, 'This is the life I want.' 4. Here's an exercise: write your obituary. What does it say? What does it tell you about your life between now and then? 5. Bring it down to the barest bone, and there is your truth.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I spent the day at home. Once my everyday working environment, it's now a treat to be here, and I enjoy it more. 2. I like being present to notice the changes in patterns the light is making on the walls and floors. It makes the space feel more like my own, our own. I See. 3. We have a big decision to make in the next week and it's causing some anxiety. I remind myself that I will do what's right. Stay steady. 4. Today was warmer, so I wore a light jacket instead of a puffer and it felt like my whole body straightened and exhaled. 5. I'm carrying that vibe into the weekend. I hope you do, too.

#fivethingsfriday, post-jetlag edition: 1. Dublin, you're charming. I love that you called me "love" in nearly every social interaction. 2. After 8h on the plane, I took a cab to my apartment, chatting and telling parenting stories with the affable cabbie the whole way. It was rainy and grey and cold, I had a headache, and we were surrounded by traffic. Still, it felt good to come home ‚Äì it always does. 3. Being a working parent is hard. Yes, I miss my family when I travel. No, I don't regret traveling or working. No, I don't dislike being a manager, even with a global team, which can be challenging. But the constant sense of responsibility at home and work does wear me down sometimes. 4. We signed a renewal on our lease. We plan to buy next year, but in the meantime, we're going to paint our current apartment to make our time here brighter and airier. I need white walls ‚Äì a blank slate after the trauma of last year's move. 5. A few other things in my life could use a blank slate, too.

#fivethingsfriday, briefly: 1. The smell of a freshly-cleaned home. 2. The last flower of the bunch, still preening. 3. Abundant, warm sunlight. 4. Three big talks at work and the first full week of daycare in the bag. 5. Dublin, Ireland on the horizon.

#fivethingsfriday 1. Today was our last day with our nanny ‚Äì Domingo will be in daycare full time starting on Monday ‚Äì and it was sweet and sad and loving and full of laughs and good conversation, as such partings should be. We miss her already. 2. (Chicago, if you need a wonderful nanny, I got a hookup.) 3. It's sunny and warm here today, and I saw young green shoots poking skyward from dark earth, and that made me smile and feel lighter. üå± 4. I'm slowing down after shipping two monster launches at work and thinking about what I want to learn next, how I want to grow. I'm honoring my need. 5. Other needs I plan to honor soon include a pedicure, a new ring, and pizza. üçïüíó

#fivethingsfriday 1. SPRING. Can I get an amen? 2. It's performance review time at work, which means I'm writing and reading about metrics and impact and navigating the line of relaying without bragging. 3. But in some instances, I kind of feel like bragging, because I work hard and accomplish a lot, and I've learned through painful experiences I have to be my own best advocate. 4. Similarly, I'm revamping my website and trying to figure out what to put there. I'm at a stage in my life and work where I have to figure out how to edit and summarize rather than emboss or embellish my experience. It feels good, but also new. Have I arrived? 5. What does arrival mean to you?

#fivethingsfriday 1. I chopped off 8 inches of hair today. I wanted a change from having a curtain of hair that wasn't doing much but required a fair amount of care and I got it. I feel lighter and freer and more myself, and it's a huge relief. 2. It also shows off my silver stripes better, which I love, so ... win-win. 3. I had a series of fortunate events this week at work for which I am grateful, and my team has a big launch on Monday and it feels breathtakingly wonderful to push useful, well-produced work into the world. Seriously, it never gets old. I could ride this high forever. 4. Yes, purpose and contribution matter. 5. Simply being alive matters more.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I took the day off to meet with and write my mortgage broker, financial planner, estate lawyer, and bank, and now I feel raw and tired. It's hard digging through so much personal information with people ‚Äì it feels exposing at first. But it's also necessary, positive, and good. I feel steadier and more in control in the aftermath. I feel empowered. 2. This ish should be taught in school at all grade levels and made available for free at public libraries. Empower the public in accessible ways. Break the system of enforced ignorance. 3. Afterward, I went for a walk and saw the first spring buds on a small tree. I stopped to stroke their fuzzy coats gently with a fingertip and smiled. My heart yipped. 4. Date night tomorrow, our first in ... six months? Black Panther. I am ready for this. 5. One week until my next haircut, and I'm itching to chop it off, to feel lighter. I talked with a friend who just chopped hers and she feels liberated. I feel nervous but exploratory, and ready for a change. I think I'll bring in some inspiration photos and let the moment guide me ... and maybe a glass of wine beforehand. ü•Ç

#fivethingsfriday 1. I went to California for work and made much of my time and felt good about it, but it felt even better to come home. It always does. 2. Magnolia blooms, forever. 3. That feeling when someone effusively, sincerely thanks you in specific ways for your skill. 4. I plan to welcome the weekend with long walks, donuts, coffee, writing, and family ... I want to slow down after a long period of thinking and acting quickly. 5. Ride that flow.

Treated myself to a beautiful rose gold-plated pen by @ajoto and a leather journal cover by #midori, both from ever-favorite local shop @marthamae_andersonville. The packaging for both was as beautiful as the goods themselves. I love when designers think about the presentation end to end ‚Äì it makes the purchase, the investment, feel special.

#fivethingsfriday 1. Every Friday night, we have pizza with @huertasn + @shannydoots. And it's always a blessing to see how much they love and care for our sweet baby, and how much he loves and cares for them. 2. This week I had an Awakening on how to use my time. I'm still figuring out how that translates to conscious and careful action but I'm grateful for the new perspective. It feels honest and self-honesty can be in short supply sometimes. 3. This week I also indulged in self-care. I was professionally fitted for and bought new bras for the first time in at least three years, and I replenished my sock drawer. These may seem like small, practical things, but as a busy working mama and writer, they are most welcome victories in tending myself. 4. I cracked a code on how to get our fussy son to sleep. This, after multiple nights of him crying and banging on things for hours after we put him down. It made me feel knowing and reaffirmed that maybe I can do this parenting thing with some measure of good grace. (Thank goodness.) 5. The children are marching and they are going to win.

#fivethingsfriday (one day late) 1. River otters make great friends. 2. He's on the cusp of something, I don't know. He has more opinions and thoughts and he's trying to push through them with us. It's hard work for all of us. 3. Nothing slows down. *We* have to slow down. 4. Ask, Is this something I should be doing? Do I want to spend time here? Sometimes the answer is surprising. Sometimes the question itself is a step toward better health. 5. Equilibrium is a myth. I only want to learn to surf better.

#fivethingsfriday 1. Our first serious snowfall, and this kid didn't want to come back inside. I had to lure him with a small mug of homemade hot cocoa. 2. Also my first serious sick day, because I picked up that same kid's daycare bug and it is wiping. me. out. Taking today to rest and be gentle with my body ‚Äì which, by the way, I need to make a common practice. 3. Also, writing ‚Äì because I have ideas for short animated films and I very much want to see them live outside me. 4. Ava Duvernay. Ryan Coogler. Patty Jenkins. Showing me the way. 5. What do I want to do, and is it true?

#fivethingsfriday 1. I stood here for a few solid minutes and felt weightless and warm. It's February in Chicago and I'm starved for sunlight and air that doesn't try to strip the flesh off my bones with its coldness. 2. A hard week. But I'm learning how to deal with it better ‚Äì a simple realization cracked my head like a thunderbolt earlier this afternoon. It was directly sobering. 3. I feel clearer than I have in months, but I expect this to ebb and flow. I'll keep sharing it with you ‚Äì even the messy bits, because I think that matters. We're all fumbling our way through this. 4. They came bearing pizza; I sent them home with vanilla-infused scones I made this morning. Sharing food is a holy act. 5. For the fighters: keep DREAM-ing. ‚úäüèæ

#fivethingsfriday 1. Grief is muddy and twisting and unpredictable. I am never comfortable with it. It wants it that way. 2. I had to take a walk to clear my head. 3. I saw a Love Wins garland flying outside my local bookstore and felt comforted. 4. I ordered a hot cocoa and kissed my husband and watched my son lean forward in his chair as we strode down the sidewalk and felt comforted. 5. I imagined that kindness and love and comfort spreading and looked to the sky. It said nothing in response. Sometimes even the sky has no answers.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I have taken this picture before. 2. I started my travels for the new year and I have mixed feelings about them. It's wonderful to see people and break up my routine, but I miss my family and my environment and my regular flow of life. I always look forward to coming home. 3. I spoke publicly to 600 people and I didn't shake or turn red or stammer or mess up. Relief. 4. My son was asleep when I came home, so I'm counting the minutes until I can wrap him in my arms and give him mama kisses. I missed him so. 5. Return to what you love. If it loves you back, it will be waiting for you.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I kicked the shit out of this week, and I'm owing at least part of my success to wearing the right footwear for the occasion. (Black rock'n'roll boots, always.) 2. I have no problem saying exactly how I feel and what I think, but I also generally have the good grace to know how to word and deliver it. It's a skill that has taken years of practice and mistakes to develop and hone and I still mess it up sometimes. But I'm proud of how far I've come and expectant for where I'll go. 3. I'm spending more time during my work days at the office, and it's lovely to see people genuinely excited to see and meet me when I go in. 4. I love how institutions of art are responding to current events. (See my Stories for more on a recent one.) Activism and art and our collective humanity are going to get us through these dark days and leave us changed on the other side. ‚òÄÔ∏è 5. Which is to say: if you can, support the people and institutions doing that work. Buy memberships, buy art, go to events, spread the word, write positive reviews, tell your people, give to organizations, pay for work. They need you. They need *us*. No one stands alone. No one can afford to, on any level. And they shouldn't have to. ‚úä

#fivethingsfriday, first of 2018: 1. I work myself too hard. I thought I'd be better at easing my pace in the new year but my habits haven't shifted. I need to consider why. 2. I'm signing up for twice-weekly morning yoga classes, starting at 6:30. It will be hard but worth the effort. It always is. 3. Someone asked me this week what I would be doing if I weren't doing my current work. Without hesitation I said I would be like that photo of EB White in his sparsely-furnished cabin, preferably near water, writing intently on a typewriter with only a cat for company. 4. Loving oneself is the hardest work. 5. His little hands in mine, and his tiny, gentle heart, are all I'll ever need. . üì∑ @hhhealthy

I rediscovered this list from a few years ago while cleaning out old journals. I updated it and tucked it into my new journal since much of it remains undone and on my mind. At least I did the hardest thing ‚Äì to date, it is also the best. üíó

I've cleared my home of chaff. Lit candles. Named my new pathways. I carry the best of intentions with me into morning. There is no counting down ‚Äì only looking forward, and surrendering to the present moment, at all times. #happynewyear #2018 ‚ú®

#fivethingsfriday 1. Home again after a long trip to NYC, where I worked, my husband visited friends and family, and my son kindly resisted most of his urges to pluck glass ornaments off my mother-in-law's tree. (Thank you, little one.) 2. Tempted to do a metalsmithing class in wax carving and casting again this winter. I have a vision for a gold pendant I want to make but I'm nervous about making costly mistakes. What would you do? 3. I sometimes wish I felt more valued ‚Äì then moments later I *will* feel that based on someone expressing appreciation to me unexpectedly. I don't believe in actualization but I'm gonna accept this as it stands and just be grateful. 4. I'm more patient lately, and I think I can attribute it less to a surrender and more to a nod of reckoning, of a shifting equilibrium. It makes life a little easier, and happier. I'll take it. 5. Slow down, and serve truth.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I spent the week in NYC, working and fighting off a gnarly head cold. Last night I finally felt better, so I walked around Manhattan and looked at work from some of my favorite ceramic artists and metalsmiths. This type of witnessing is filling and healing and sparking all at once for me; it's joyful. 2. Digging iconography lately, and adding that radiant eye to the list of shapes I want to get tattooed. 3. Watching family chase my son and play with him has been a prolonged and beautiful engagement that I am genuinely sorry to leave behind. 4. Blessings to the woman at 7th Avenue and 21st Street who stared at my loose hair and complimented its silver waves. I don't mind my age but I have started noticing more signs of it, and it's comforting in strange and significant ways to see other women respect it. 5. Happy weekend. It's rainbows all the way down. üåàüôå

#fivethingsfriday: 1. I am glad to see the end of a week that was intense both personally and professionally, but also grateful to end it with good news. 2. I read the recent profile of Daniel Day-Lewis in @wmag and was incredibly moved by the way he approaches his life and his work. Recommended. 3. I deactivated my Facebook profile this week, unannounced. It felt right. I'm more interested in putting my attention where it needs to be and #reclaimingmytime. 4. New life plans include creating my own mold, then breaking it. Repeat. 5. New York: See you soon.

#fivethingsfriday 1. We have eaten at home for all meals every day this week, save for breakfast treats this morning. I have loved the sight of my son standing on tippy toes to help my husband whisk pancakes and put dumplings into a pot, then run flat-out to set the table with one thing at a time: plates, bowls, cups. As my husband noted: You can live anywhere, but it becomes a home once you have a memory. Cooking makes those memories for us. 2. Good food feeds the body and the soul. 3. The call to write more and worry less is growing stronger. I wonder how that will unfold, what that means for me. 4. This week we took a very important step toward directing our future, and it felt good. Sturdy. Overdue. 5. Reminder: Don't be hard on yourself when it's not warranted. If your aim is true, it's rarely warranted.

#fivethingsfriday 1. First snowfall. 2. Winter makes me want to wrap up my bones and go to ground. I'm trying to respect this urge while holding myself to being not entirely hidden or out of band. 3. I also am using this time ‚Äì made charged with anticipation of vacations and parties, holidays and travel ‚Äì to slow down, be measured, watch my footing, choose my words, and simplify in a time typically marked by excess. 4. It is growing easier to see what it is important. 5. Saying yes to good chocolate, both hot and in bar form.

#fivethingsfriday 1. More art, always. 2. Also, language as art. I'm going to stop diminishing my draw toward the organized word and let go of my belief that art must be Other Than. My capabilities are my own and they are good. 3. Weekends are for family. Evenings are for family. Life is for family, whatever shape that may take. 4. I could be kinder to myself. 5. In my humblest heart, I know I could be kinder to others, too. üíï ps‚Äîbeautiful ceramic + rope garland by @mquanstudio via @shop_sailor ‚ú®

Last night I was moved to join the #liberatedlines offering from @robin.soyala + @alisha_sommer along with nearly 20 other communicators.

#fivethingsfriday 1. I love this poem by #mariannemoore, but I would add ‚Äì and after crossing, I will turn back and be your guide, so you may do the same. Help others. 2. I move more deeply into the solace of family, of slowing waaaay down and noticing and breathing, of using right speech and right action (Buddhist practices). It is making me healthier and happier and more level, more even. That has a ripple effect, though it can take time to see the impact. 3. We are not machines. We need tending. Do that work. 4. The news is depressing and angering, heartbreaking and frustrating. We can't do everything, but we can do something. 5. Head lifted. Heart open. Fight.

#fivethingsfriday (one day late): 1. I'm buying more art lately; it brings me joy, and I love supporting the work of others. It helps me resist feeling like the current state of the world is intractable or entirely bleak. Art gives me hope and life, new perspective and beauty. 2. This particular piece was posted on Instagram the day a friend died. It reads: "And to make an end is to make a new beginning." It feels comforting and holy to have it in my home. 3. Also giving me joy: Celebrating my son's second birthday with family and friends. Our community. We feel Held. üíó 4. Less sunlight means more time for careful and considered thought and action. 5. Make it count. Make it all count.

#fivethingsfriday (üì∑ @hhhealthy): 1. Today I learned that something I did months ago had an enormous positive impact and it made my whole body go numb with happiness. 2. It's 90 degrees in Chicago on the first day of fall. This is not right. Also, it's gross. 3. Don't hold that against me when it's below zero here this winter and I grump about it. I'm a Chicagoan. I'm allowed. 4. My child is his own world, and I am moved every day to witness and be part of it. 5. Things that are true bear repeating.

#fivethingsfriday, NYC: 1. I spent the week in NYC, going through training, working in the 9th Avenue office with wonderful colleagues, and staying in a spare, small hotel room that overlooked the High Line. And eating. My goodness, the food! And walking the city and savoring its skyline and‚Ä¶ 2. I sometimes can't believe this is my life. This is not at all what I expected of myself as a quiet kid who hid in books in room corners and mostly wanted to be left alone, while also wishing for people to whom she could be close, by whom she could be loved. 3. Which isn't to say all this isn't challenging at times, significantly so. But I'm open to growing and trying to move more in the moment while using my words and language and reactions carefully. Everything counts. 4. At the same time, I'm learning to doubt myself less, and love myself more. This, too, is not something I expected of myself. I love me. How hard is that? 5. And I love others more steadily and truly, without doubt or contingencies ‚Ä¶ and all this feels like the gentle bones of a good life. üíó

#FiveThingsFriday: 1. I'm wrapping up a staycation and preparing for my next trip. Transitions abound. 2. I had a massage and reiki therapy yesterday and my body and energy felt transformed. I hugged my therapist in gratitude before leaving, and she laughed and said, "I love my job." I told her I love that she loves her job, too. 3. The weather is shifting, and I'm wrapping the cooler air around me like a favorite scarf. This is the season for introspection and deeper grounding. I am listening. 4. Today I gifted one of my remaining @umberdove stones to a friend who loved her but was never able to collect one of her pieces. As I was cleaning my dresser where the stone lay, ready to be given, this feather *danced* in its ceramic holder. I know what it meant. 5. If you love something, give it away.

#fivethingsfriday: 1. I have one more week until my first vacation in 20 months. Counting the days, friends. 2. I'm traveling to New York next month for work and planning a museum visit for each evening I'm in the city. 3. I've been dreaming in poems. I wake up and the words sound like a bell, or a thunderclap, before disappearing. 4. The best way I know to love someone is to share them with the world, so I've gifted one Umber stone to a friend, and I have another waiting in the wings, already designated. 5. Grow old, not angry. üïä

#FiveThingsFriday, the newly-returned home edition: 1. I have been traveling to the West Coast for 3 of the past 10 weeks. Grateful to wake in my own bed this morning. 2. After losing people I love and finding I have no photos of us together, I am fully embracing doing more snapshots with friendly faces. (And maybe more tackle-hugs. You've been warned.) 3. These are some of the wonderful people with whom I work ‚Äì you could not ask for better. I have their backs; they have mine. 4. There is pizza in my very near future. 5. I am here to love and serve others. How about you?

San Jos√©, California. I've traveled here for work three times in ten weeks. Grateful for safe passage back home tonight, and for memories of views like this.

Resuming an old habit, Five Things Friday, from my Flickr days: 1. I have seen more feathers in the past four weeks than the past eight years. I feel you, @umberdove ‚Äì thank you. 2. Inspiration should lead to action. 3. It is ok to say stop. It is ok to rest. The mind need yield to the body just as the body need yield to the mind. 4. I am writing creatively again and it feels like a rebirth. 5. Black linen everything.

Questioning work, art, life. Appreciating this small, perfect gift from a friend. Wading through a measure of grief from a loss, while humbly acknowledging the scope of others' is tidal, and mine seems tributary in comparison. Letting go of the hours left until the new dawn, and finding peace with that decision. Blessing the moments between now and that new horizon with breath and folded limbs, cicada song and singing bowl ‚Ä¶ This life is not all beauty but I am Showing Up for it and for now, that is enough. ‚ú®üíõ‚ú® . . . ps‚ÄîI'm finding my way through this and encountering questions about my time here and what I want to do with it. I think that's normal. It's just hard, all of it.

I was asked recently where I want to go, where I want to end up. I didn't have an answer then but I think I do now. I want to be softer, and I want to help other people become softer. I want to be an open door, a conduit, a channel. I want to be the wave that lifts rather than crashes over others. I have small glances at the forms each may take and I am learning to be comfortable not knowing them with complete clarity. In the meantime, the work continues. ‚úåÔ∏è #dailywalkreport

Smile courtesy of Very Good News. New jacket by @eileenfisherny to celebrate and to complement a growing wardrobe of what my husband endearingly refers to as my Jedi wizard clothing.

The shapes of grief: Boxes. We've been saying goodbye slowly to what was our home, our space, from the doorway where we were engaged to the bookcases where we were married; to the bedroom where I labored with our son and the living room where we brought him home from his birth.

I snapped a photo of this street art on May 18, 2009, the date I turned 30. I spent the day at the Art Institute, then walked north and found this under an overpass near Navy Pier. Three years later I would go to work for the man shown on the right ‚Äì our president, @barackobama. In the weeks since the ill-fated U.S. Presidential Election, I have seen a rise of amazing art dedicated to questioning the election results, uplifting those afraid in their aftermath, and demanding equality and peace in the name of the people, the republic. I'm gratified to see art, once again, as a calling card for the voice of humanity. Make art. Support art. Buy art. And stay strong. ‚úäÔ∏è

Last night I attended President Obama's Farewell Address. I wore this necklace by artist Jeanine Payer ‚Äì a gift to myself after concluding my work for the president in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. It's inscribed with these lines from the poem written and read by Elizabeth Alexander at the 2008 U.S. Presidential Inauguration: _ Love beyond marital, filial, national, love that casts a widening pool of light, love with no need to pre-empt grievance. In today‚Äôs sharp sparkle, this winter air, any thing can be made, any sentence begun. On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp, praise song for walking forward in that light. _ Today I mostly felt scattered and drained ‚Äì an after-effect from the loving, wistful euphoria of seeing my president and my people together last night, all happy, sad, longing, angry, frustrated, bereft, believing. _ I understand there always have been hard times, and there always will be. I know this most certainly is one of them. But Alexander's words give me strength, and hope. I'm determined to clear my mind, stand up straight, and put one foot in front of the other, toward a positive and inclusive future for all of us. That's love ‚Äì the love I believe in. _ I hope you're with me, even if it takes time. Let's keep walking, together. ‚ù§

"If you walk away, I'll walk away First tell me which road you will take I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day So you walk that way, I'll walk this way And the future hangs over our heads And it moves with each current event Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain Just stay in when it's looking this way And the moon's laying low in the sky Forcing everything metal to shine And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case They argue walk this way, no, walk this way And there's kids playing guns in the street And one's pointing his tree branch at me So I put my hands up I say 'enough is enough, If you walk away, I'll walk away' And he shot me dead I found a liquid cure From my landlocked blues It'll pass away like a slow parade It's leaving but I don't know how soon" This year is ending. I plan to show up prepared to fight hard and love big in the new one. Happy 2017, friends. ‚ù§

Four years is a long time to suffer a willful tyrant and neglectful incompetent.

I flew home late yesterday evening from attending a team offsite on the West Coast and felt a strange sense of comfort from familiar sights: the bright lights of the city grid zipping squarely into the horizon under my plane; the click of my feet down my usual gate; the holiday decorations illuminating the hall.

At my company's (Tim Burton-themed) holiday party last night, I did karaoke, ate fondue, and do-si-do'd with a guy dressed as Beetlejuice while my husband cheered me on. It was only our second date night since our son was born 14 months ago, and the perfect release to a busy and stressful week for both of us. (And oh *howdy* was that fondue good.) I have much to be grateful for as this year starts to close, but my people are tops on that count ‚Ä¶ family, whether born or forged, is life.

#familytoepoints, the presidential election edition. We cast our votes for @hillaryclinton today for many reasons, all of which have been shared by others in eloquent terms on many platforms. We were proud to take our son and vote together in our first presidential election as a family. üá∫üá∏üëä We are with her, all the way.

Popped into the loveliest little art supplies and curiosities shop today. Petted watercolor sets and played with elegant brass mechanical pencils; thumbed through a few books on Japanese book binding and murals. Planning a return trip for recommendations on research into William Morris' life and work. #dailywalkreport #familytoepoints

Domingo's first artwork. I look forward to gifting him his first set of finger paints. And then papering the walls and floor so he can use them with abandon.

Today my son turned 1 year old. The three of us spent the day together, visiting the zoo and getting donuts and taking photos and smiling. I'm powerfully grateful for the shape of my life, of our lives. We have a beautiful apartment and a happy son, and I have a good job that allows me to work from home and the flexibility to take time off and good health care. Our world feels simply whole. There is hard work and choice but there is also luck. We are lucky. We don't forget it. üçÄ

Yesterday: a bocce ball tournament and a lovely drive around Wisconsin. Today: iced tea and a healthy dose of writing, followed closely by a solid stretch of a walk and window shopping. The weekend has felt luxuriously summery and I'm rating this weather 10/10, would enjoy year-round.

Adding "catching my son in mid-face plant" to the list of reasons why I love working from home.

Last night was the first I registered that the days were shortening. I looked out this window at 7:30p and saw it was dark, and I felt it in my bones ‚Äì fall is coming, and winter is not far behind. In years past, I have not welcomed winter. I shrank back hard from its skin-gnawing bitterness and bone-shrinking chill. But this year, for the first time I can remember, I have an understanding. Winter has its own lessons to teach. It nurtures something in me, too: a brisk clarity, a restful incubation. We are starting to prepare for it, which includes prepping the house for the deep battening-down during long, cold months. There is something sharp and clear and focused about the season and preparing for it that sparks me. I suppose it's simple: I like getting things done, and I especially like getting them done when I have deadlines. But more soundly than that, the pressure is the perfect complement to summer's lazy, proud life and the deep rise and fall of spring and autumn. I cannot have one without the others. Mother Nature is one hell of a program manager.

For my son. üíô I've started writing more free-form poetry. It's a change from my @19syllables format, which means I'm stretching in a new way. This is a modest effort, but more ideas are rumbling. I look forward to rolling them out of the deep.

#dailywalkreport with #familytoepoints ‚Äì today we went for our morning walk and felt the cool air whisper that change was coming. I'm feeling fall. üçÇ I'm feeling ready. even bigger, though, is that today I felt like *myself* again for the first time since before my pregnancy. I love being my son's mama but it is *not easy* adjusting to a whole new shape of life. it feels like a long exhale, a happy sigh. I am optimistic that more days like this are ahead. üíõ

Earlier this week we found a hungry caterpillar munching on our farmer's market bouquet. We gently transferred her to a milkweed plant on our kitchen countertop and overnight, she shed her skin and turned into her chrysalis! She should emerge in about two weeks, so we're looking to transfer her to our landlord's or neighbor's garden in about a week. Until then, she's safely inside. üíö

#dailywalkreport, and a #fivethingsfriday entry, one day late: 1. Changes are afoot on multiple fronts. I am instigating some and doing my best to rise to meet those instigated by others. 2. My son is standing. 3. I love connecting dots among and trying to help people I love who are doing their heart's work. 4. I, too, am trying to do my heart's work. 5. None of this is easy, but that does not impact its worthiness.
