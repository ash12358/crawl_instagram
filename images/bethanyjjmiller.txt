Great read! A young woman volunteers at a monastery in Myanmar and learns all the life lessons in one heartbreaking summer. Author Rosalie Metro conquers history, politics, conflict, and spirituality, but mostly concentrates on our relationships with the people we encounter and how their presence (or absence) affects our lives. 🙏🏼 #myanmar #novel #reading

#Repost @katenorthrup with @get_repost ・・・ I’m so saddened to hear this week of the suicides of both Kate Spade and @anthonybourdain. ::: Such a reminder that all that glitters is not gold and just because someone seems like they have it all together does not mean they do. ::: I recently took action on behalf of a loved one who I felt was in danger of hurting themselves because I didn’t think they were in the position to advocate for themselves adequately. ::: It was incredibly uncomfortable. I questioned whether I was overstepping my bounds of social propriety. I didn’t want to do it. ::: But I did because I knew what the worst case scenario was if I didn’t say something.

Sitting “Reserve” has its perks- like those gorgeous days when scheduling doesn’t call. This makes me happy because as a former airline manager, I know all the trips are covered. And as a pilot, I appreciate working for an airline that’s rolling smoothly today. All days are different and unexpected things happen, but I wasn’t needed today. Other days, I get a phone call at 3am to cover a trip. But today, just chilling. Ready to go, but happy to stay. I got a good workout, a little studying, and read my book. Now- off to make dinner with my husband. 👩🏼‍✈️ #airlinepilot #airlines #pilotlife #aircrew #reserve #flying #workout #reading #study

Pro tip: peanut butter. When your dog quits walking during her walk, it’s because she stepped in GUM then mulch. So there’s gummy mulch stuck to the fur between her foot pads. Google said to toothbrush peanut butter through the hair ... but she hates having her feet touched. Hates it. A small wrestling match ensued while we worked it out. There was much yelping, mostly from the dog. Now I have peanut butter all smashed in the carpet. At least she got to lick the bowl. PEOPLE! DON’T SPIT OUT YOUR GUM. 😾 #benice #dog #peanutbutter

Airports & construction! Two of my favorite observation loves.

This is my brave cousin’s family. Much love to Cian and other kids battling CF. #Repost @annievphoto with @get_repost ・・・ A funny and extremely energetic, 12 year old who loves to play soccer, basketball and video games.  Photographed this beautiful soul the other day and he is all that and more - having know this precious boy since he was two, he exudes beauty, humor and grace.  Knowing his mom well and the challenges this diseases brings, including financial - I asked her to write about the realities of daily life. ✨Cian was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) when he was three weeks old. Cystic Fibrosis is a chronic lung disease that also affects the digestive system liver and pancreas. This can cause him to have pneumonia frequently and keep him from gaining weight. ✨There is no CURE for Cystic Fibrosis. The only thing we can do is keep him as healthy as possible until they find a CURE. ✨Keeping Cian healthy is a lot of work for both himself and our family. Cian has been in and out of the hospital throughout his life and has battled pneumonia 20+ times. Cian has had multiple procedures, surgeries and hospitalizations along the way, including a feeding tube to help him keep his weight up. He does 6 – 10 breathing treatments every single day.  Cian needs do a chest therapy treatment that is called “the vest” - it shakes the mucus from the wall of the lungs to help prevent pneumonia. He has to do the treatment 2 times daily and 4 times when he is sick. Each treatment takes 45 minutes. ✨Cian is currently on 14 different types of medication and takes 34 pills daily. When he gets really sick or hospitalized he usually needs IV antibiotics for 2 weeks -  in the hospital for the first week and then at home for the second week which can be challenging. ✨Thank you for helping us raise funds to donate to research to find a CURE for Cystic Fibrosis!  With all our love, Pat, @lyndagriffin4 ,Lynda, Patrick and Cian 🙏🏻. 💜💜💜Please see the link in my bio to contribute. A percentage of all sales will be donated directly to the Cystic Fibrosis foundation on Cian’s behalf and matched by @indiahicksstyle #100DAYS100K.

San Francisco has a lot of great billboards, graffiti, architecture & sculptures. This one keeps getting my attention. No one cares about your life, your possessions, your family, or your goals more than you do. Be excellent at being you. Care. Have pride. Ask for help. Do it yourself- because no one else will shine like you. ✨If I ever told you “No one cares about your career!” that’s because I 💛 U (and because it’s true 😘) • • • 🙋🏼‍♀️ #effort #care #tryhard #workyourbuttoff #beyou

What a great story of following an interesting spark and finding new friends & concepts. Love this, Kat! #Repost @katcoleatl with @get_repost ・・・ The story behind this photo (aka the album cover). I followed @sxsw on Instagram and saw these hilarious coffee cups with phrases that are a lighthearted jab at a community I certainly count myself a part of - and a sarcastic reminder to be present. Examples: Did you miss out on the ayahuasca incubator keynote? Did you miss out on the cryptocurrency kombucha meet up? What about the drone powered goat yoga healing session 😂 I followed them and saw they had an official “launch” of their brand FOMO.  I decided I would skip the early crowded sessions, and go check it out. I headed 20 minutes outside of SXSW Austin (that’s far yo) to this little cafe.  The Lyft driver says, “what are you going out here for - it’s kind of a shady area - should I wait for you outside?”. I said I was going to check out a fun product and I’d be cool. I walked in the cafe and see 4 people. Two women who look like sisters behind the counter, one dude at the front door, two people eating empanadas. I thought - uhhhhh - am I in the wrong spot? But then I saw the coffee cups with the phrases stacked on the espresso machine. Two more people walked in who looked super cool and fun - so I asked if they were here for the @FOMOcoffee launch. They said they were the creators of the brand and concept. While no one else showed up, the hour that followed was magical caffeinated goodness. Turns out we knew many of the same people, and their offices in NYC are a few blocks from where @Daleyervin and I used to live. We laughed, traded stories, celebrated the mother daughter duo of Latina powerhouses who opened this cafe and instantly became friends. Taking a random trip to explore something new solo was rewarding in so many ways, specifically meeting these great humans. Kindred spirits for sure. My new friends also came 6 hours later to support me at my panel later that day. A reminder to explore, follow things that seem to speak to you, be curious and humble while being courageous and confident to experience something and someone new. The universe is

When you still don’t have furniture in your new apartment, you get Asian takeout (happy New Year!) via @ubereats and review furniture options on your laptop while sitting in the dog bed 🤨 (as the box the dog bed came in is our “dining room table”).

The best morning drive! We got on the road at sunrise (last day & anxious to get HOME) and traveling up I5 through the Central Valley. Jeff drives while I read us research about pistachios, almond trees, the politics of water distribution, the history of botanical imports to the US from Asia & the Middle East, farming & pollination procedures, and other interesting issues. We are listening to the morning news and discussing all the things we need (get) to do for our new home.

Scarlett and her stuffed chicken are good road warriors & hotel guests. We were going to take the northern route from Louisville to San Francisco, but Winter Storm Mateo closed the Chicago Airports with snow just hours after we flew through yesterday. So after we picked up Scarlett, we decided on the southern route with extra miles on Day 1. We made it to Tulsa, and with luck, we’ll be on the west side of the ice storm that’s passing this area in a couple of hours. We’re bedded down for the night, so we’ll see how things look in the morning. Hoping all the travelers out there- on the road and in the skies- are safe in this weather. 🚘 #roadwarrior #dogsofinstagram #ourdogisfamily #movingcrosscountry #hotel #adventure

Riding @bartbayarea to go see our new apartment. Just finished a trip and meeting Jeff at “our stop” to walk the last few blocks together to our new home. 💑 Thinking about all the things life throws you and all the blessings we have. Am I doing enough? Am I doing the right things? Are these good decisions? And then, right when you need it- a note from God. #superexcited #sanfrancisco #homesweethome #bayarea #pilotlife #blessings #answeredprayers

Sometimes, you get a good deal. Always, you make your situation great. Never, you let others determine your mission. 🎼 Have fun. Learn things. Be better than you were yesterday. Help others do the same. Remember what team you’re on. Posting this for a friend. Conferences, learning, befriending, innovating, and doing fabulous work are all important. Sometimes you’re a horse on the ceiling. 🤘🏼 #innovation #rebel #workhard #playhard #teachmesomething #learning #working #beyou

Chokes me up every time. God bless. #Repost @usinterior ・・・ It’s been 16 years since the tragic events of #September11, 2001, but the images of that day remain clear. Two planes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and a third into the Pentagon in Virginia. Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives. Because of the actions of 40 passengers and crew aboard the fourth plane, Flight 93, the U.S. Capitol was saved. In New York, Virginia, Pennsylvania and across the country, people gather today to remember the depth of our loss and the strength of our resolve. By visiting these places and hearing their stories, those who were taken will never be forgotten.

Another boat ride! This one on Cape Cod Duckmobiles. I loved my time working at Ride The Ducks (different company). Knowing the history of DUKW & LARC vehicles- not just WWII and the Vietnam War, but in Hurricane Katrina and now the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey- but also the owners & employees who love this business, we knew we had to ride again. Great trip! Thanks, Ducks! QUACK 🦆 #ridetheducks #duckboat #quack #hurricane #wareffort #history #boat #sailing #adventure #travel
