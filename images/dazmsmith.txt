‚ÄúRemember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!‚Äù

#TheGramSham ~ The night after seeing Santana play live at the Dome, I went for a precautionary scan on my calf, which was swollen and sore. ‚ÄúClot. DVT,‚Äù said the radiologist. Her matter of fact words hit me like a sledgehammer. I knew enough about pulmonary embolisms, strokes and similar, to know that this was not good news. Worse still, I was out of medical aid hospital cover. So public healthcare it was. Helen Joseph. 8 days later I was discharged. And every day now, is a step towards full health. I was entirely the wrong profile for this. Don‚Äôt smoke. Don‚Äôt drink. Trail running fit. No recent traumas. No recent operations. No recent long haul flights. No genetic propensity. No reason. But life throws ‚Äúcurve balls‚Äù at us all, no matter our station in life. And we all deal with these challenges thrown, in our own way. Never alone. Never on our own. Even though sometimes it may feel like it. To @TheJoLurie ... thank you for the challenge. The #GramSham gets real. #YouthDay #YouthDay2018

#LoveTrail ~ 6 weeks after lying in hospital diagnosed with DVT, today I ran (slowly) the Kloofzicht Gluhwein Trail run with friends. ‚ÄúGot your back‚Äù friends. I thought of Xolani Luvuno tackling the Comrades Marathon on crutches. Of the miracle of movement. Life is too short not to feed your adventure spirit.

‚ÄúNight falls. Or has fallen. Why is it that night falls, instead of rising, like the dawn? Yet if you look east, at sunset, you can see night rising, not falling; darkness lifting into the sky, up from the horizon, like a black sun behind cloud cover. Like smoke from an unseen fire, a line of fire just below the horizon, brushfire or a burning city. Maybe night falls because it‚Äôs heavy, a thick curtain pulled up over the eyes.

‚ÄúLet there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.‚Äù Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet

‚ÄúWhen love beckons to you follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth...... But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love. And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself." But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully.‚Äù Kahlil Gibran, Le Proph√®te

"How do you know, when you think blue ‚Äî when you say blue ‚Äî that you are talking about the same blue as anyone else? You cannot get a grip on blue. Blue is the sky, the sea, a god‚Äôs eye, a devil‚Äôs tail, a birth, a strangulation, a virgin‚Äôs cloak, a monkey‚Äôs ass. It‚Äôs a butterfly, a bird, a spicy joke, the saddest song, the brightest day. Blue is sly, slick, it slides into the room sideways, a slippery trickster. This is a story about the color blue, and like blue, there‚Äôs nothing true about it. Blue is beauty, not truth. ‚ÄòTrue blue‚Äô is a ruse, a rhyme; it‚Äôs there, then it‚Äôs not. Blue is a deeply sneaky color." Christopher Moore, Sacr√© Bleu: A Comedy d'Art

"Facets, Matthew. Each facet catches the light in its own way. It glints and sparkles and flashes uniquely. It would almost be possible to believe that the facet was the jewel; not just a tiny part of it. But, then, as we move the jewel another facet catches the light." "So? What's your point?" "My point? I have no point, Matthew. Save for the jewel, and the facets, and the light. We see an aspect of the whole. But the facet is not the jewel.... Neil Gaiman, The Kindly Ones

#LoveTrail ~ The inaugural Bezhoek Extreme took place in the beautiful Bezuidenhoutshoek Nature Reserve near Middleburg, today. A big thanks to Bennie Roux, course architect, Erik Vermeulen inimitable MC, and Regardt Van Der Berg for late entries to the race. Under grey skies, but perfect running conditions, we set off at a quick lick with a flat and fast start to the race ... wide open grasslands, and big skies. A mix of single track & jeep track, soft underfoot after the rains, made it easy to get into a rhythm and just enjoy being out there. The field spread quickly ... and I was soon running alone, reveling in the silence of the great outdoors, smiling at the scurrying busyness of the beetles and chongololos, thinking to myself "Hey, it's Saturday guys! Why so busy?" ... somehow forgetting that we'd set our alarms for 4am to make the start 2 hours drive from Johannesburg. A brief meeting with Takalani at the first water point, she on her 30km loop which had started an hour before us, and I holding up the rearguard on the 16km loop! We swapped a few words, before Takalani was off, then I was alone once again. The valley opened up at around the halfway mark, spectacular cliffs, and lush riverine forest that hugged the Olifants River made for a magical middle 5km of mostly single track. Beautiful moss covered rocks and trees alluded to the water in the area, as did a mid-race shower, spraying a cooling mist onto runners descending to the river valley. An all too brief glance at the Olifants River, before the long, slow grind back home. There's something about rivers flowing wide in the wild ... the rush of movement and the power of flowing water. It invigorates tired bodies and minds. There's something too, about taking the time to just soak up the surrounds, feel your heart beat, legs and lungs working, breathing deep & casting off the cares of this world. Sharing the moments with like-minded friends, all with their own challenges, their own battles, their own dreams. It's why we run.

"The old adage that people only want what they can‚Äôt have or what they can‚Äôt tame‚Äî is totally primitive. A being of higher origins will know instinctively that life on earth is a series of chances, moments and concepts. That‚Äôs really all that you have. So when you find one of these things and it makes you burn, or it makes you feel peace inside, or it makes you look forwards and backwards and here all at the same time‚Äî that‚Äôs when you know to hold onto it. And you hold onto it with every fiber of your being. Because it‚Äôs in the holding on of these chances and moments and concepts that life is lived. Every other kind of living is only in vitro. I don‚Äôt care what psychologists say today about how the human mind works. Because one day they will reach this pinnacle and they will see what I see and they will look upon the old ways as primitive. As long and gone. We do not wish to have what we can‚Äôt have. We wish to burn in whatever flame we have stepped into." C. JoyBell C.

"Be true and find happiness- that's what I believe in. I tell you I struggle so much right now finding motivation and energy to train hard for running. The happiness is not there, but the stress to get in shape is, which makes it not worth it for me. Nothing is really more important than keeping the happiness for what you love. So, I try to take a step back, meditate to calm down, do other things, and run a tiny bit when I feel for it." Emelie Forsberg -- So I did.

"Home, what are you? You are the roof over our heads The bed under our tired bodies The blanket that keeps us warm Home, you are the garden that we play in The vegetables that we eat Lunches on the patio the music in the street You are the greeting, a bark, a meow The couch we rest our feet on And people that we meet You're the memories of laughter Of sadness and anger too The entertainment of a boxset of new beginnings Of hope and dreams come true Home, you are the key to Doors and pathways The crackling fireplace The warm water that showers us And light that lets us read Home, you're the door and driveway That keep us safe, A curtain of escape We wake in your walls and fall asleep here too We fill you up with objects and with people too Family, partners, children, animals, everything we collect. When the fire came to ravage you. It took all of you. The roof, the floor, the kitchen sink. The laughter. It took all of you Home, you may be gone But the laughter will return and The hearts that knew these walls will bind together, stronger, than Before." Kate Collins #knysnafire

"Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern." Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray

"I thought how lovely and how strange a river is. A river is a river, always there, and yet the water flowing through it is never the same water and is never still. It‚Äôs always changing and is always on the move. And over time the river itself changes too. It widens and deepens as it rubs and scours, gnaws and kneads, eats and bores its way through the land. Even the greatest rivers- the Nile and the Ganges, the Yangtze and he Mississippi, the Amazon and the great grey-green greasy Limpopo all set about with fever trees-must have been no more than trickles and flickering streams before they grew into mighty rivers. Are people like that? I wondered. Am I like that? Always me, like the river itself, always flowing but always different, like the water flowing in the river, sometimes walking steadily along andante, sometimes surging over rapids furioso, sometimes meandering wit hardly any visible movement tranquilo, lento, ppp pianissimo, sometimes gurgling giacoso with pleasure, sometimes sparkling brillante in the sun, sometimes lacrimoso, sometimes appassionato, sometimes misterioso, sometimes pesante, sometimes legato, sometimes staccato, sometimes sospirando, sometimes vivace, and always, I hope, amoroso. Do I change like a river, widening and deepening, eddying back on myself sometimes, bursting my banks sometimes when there‚Äôs too much water, too much life in me, and sometimes dried up from lack of rain? Will the I that is me grow and widen and deepen? Or will I stagnate and become an arid riverbed? Will I allow people to dam me up and confine me to wall so that I flow only where they want? Will I allow them to turn me into a canal to use for they own purposes? Or will I make sure I flow freely, coursing my way through the land and ploughing a valley of my own?" Aidan Chambers, This is All: The Pillow Book of Cordelia Kenn

"To have been where you have been And to still have joy, Dazzling in your heart, Now there‚Äôs a thing to make the whole world smile." Scott Hastie
