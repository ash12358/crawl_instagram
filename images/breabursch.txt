We began our #journeyhome 5.5 hours ago. 30 minutes in, our Lexus decided to throw a tantrum and leave us stranded with limited reception and a whole lot of questions. Papa came to rescue us and we got it back to #thelakehouse. Now we’re in Papa’s truck and have left the Lexus and Nova behind with Papa and Mema and we are LEGIT INCHING over the pass (because #Seattle traffic) so J can dump us four out, head to Arlington to grab a flat bed and then high tail it BACK to the lake house to retrieve our car, our daughter, and his parents. SO. MANY. MILES. Then time to play mechanic and sort out the Lexus’ tantrum. Never a dull moment, people. #thislifeisthebestlife #evenwhenitsuckssometimes #allthequalitytime

So... we did a thing today. A BIG thing. Bigger than we thought we’d do, for sure. But big families need big toys, so we aren’t cutting any corners (I guess). We are super stoked for all the memory making this beautiful beast will bring. Also... anyone in the market for a sweet fully contained 19ft trailer?

Sweet #baby Noni has relished her day of celebration. I’m not sure if she liked the zoo trip, long afternoon nap, piles of gifts, or playtime at her favorite #McDonald’s best. Dear, sweet baby girl I never expected, you are exactly what this #mama heart need to be full. Full of joy, pride, and silliness. You are #theverybestthreeyearold. EVER.

This sweet hearted boy. He was the one who melted into a puddle of tears when mama and daddy left for vacay. The one who called me every day. Texted every few hours. Squirreled his body into my lap in the wee hours the morning we got back. Death gripped my hands, and gave the deepest, most contented sigh of relaxation, and drifted back to sleep with a smile. He still loves his mama most. It won’t be forever. But it’s now. And I’m doing all I can to never forget it today. #quinny #secondborn #32weeker #thesoftestofheartsandstinkiestoffeet

70+mph #ziplining? Scratch that off the #bucketlist. The sights and the hiking was perfect. The off-road ATV was a nail biter and the company second to none. It’s a YES from us! Totally recommend the #flyinhawaiianzipline for some more extreme fun!

A smidge of guilt washed over me on this #kidfreemothersday. But then I took a deep swing of this #champagne and relished in the fact that I haven’t had to wipe a nose or a pair of buns that weren’t my own for three days with even more days ahead. A big thank you to #theinlaws (#outlaws?) who made this possible for J and I. Best #mothersday gift ever.

From #bikinis, to the one piece. Frying in the sun, to all the SPF (and children). Vacays on the cheap, to #makingitrain. The changes are deep and real and sometimes unforgiving (I’m looking at you, boobs...), but with you, it’s all the best and I wouldn’t be anywhere else. #wuvtruewuv #17yearslater YES. 17 years.

#year35 has been rough. Shingles. Influenza. Food poisoning. Since mid February. And then today. Oh, today. You were rough. After my morning photo session, in the harsh light of the target fitting room while dealing with trying on bathing suits, I saw it. A quite large mass on my lower back. Like half a baseball a few inches under my bra line. No matter how I bent or twisted or turned, it was there. It is solid. Cue call to the doctor who says get to urgent care. Urgent care says we need an ultrasound. Today. It’s not nothing and we need to have a diagnosis today. Cue panic. And fear. And a million what ifs. Cue a brain so loud with thoughts and eyes so full of tears and questions and TERROR. I’m gonna hurl. But my girls are with me and I have to suck. It. Up. So we wait for the next appointment. Begging, pleading prayers of desperation. Brokenness. And red hot sickness in my gut. Stress cleaning. A need to stay busy and not let my brain rest because when around me is quiet I hear all the screaming inside. Ultrasound appointment. The tech can’t tell me anything. Or won’t. The radiologist will read the scans and come to give me a diagnosis if he can. The machine is having difficulties transmitting the scans. I have to wait. I saw the images. They are not fluid filled (cyst). It’s solid. Urgent care told me it’s not a lipoma. But, stupid me, WebMD’ed this already and I can’t breathe because my throat is constricted and red hot rocks of fear and terror are buzzing in my ears and the worst is coming. The tech won’t tell me because it’s bad and all the things are flashing before my eyes. The radiologist comes in. I am ok. I am not sick. I am ok. Lipoma he says. It’s a lipoma. And I just cry. Because this day. These six hours have aged me a decade. I’ll need some simple surgery but I am ok. So. We gonna #treatyoself. Because lipoma>sarcoma. It’s a lipoma partay up in this hizzy tonight! And, forevermore, if you need a prayer partner, or meme sharer, or shoulder when you are waiting on  huge medical diagnosis, I am here for you. #dontdoscarymedicalstuffalone

Sometimes, life just needs to BE HANDLED. Like when you rushrushrush to get ready to hit #theymca for an early AM workout (you've missed them all this week because at least one child has been puking every daaaaaay) to find that a little girl you know left her car door open all. Night. Long. And now your battery is dead. I was THISCLOSE to throwing hands up in the air and just not going. I mean, #itwasasign right? NOT TODAY, SATAN. This meant switching both of #thebigcarseats from our roomy Lexus SUV to the tiny, it only seats four, Jeep Wrangler. Oh, and in ten minutes or less because I can't be late to this class! I can do this! I CAN DO THIS. Every #mom knows what a COMPLETE #PITA the BIG car seat is. I almost had to take the top off the Jeep to get it in (because soft top, convertible!). Thankfully the girls were waiting for me inside because #truckermouth under stress. Happy to report - I made it JUST as class was starting. So I was stuck in the front row right in front of the instructor (which I hate). In see through leggings. SEE. THROUGH. LEGGINGS. ...And all the downward dogs and #burpies and butts in the air and pants stretched to their max and nice striped undies you have there. #cantmakethisup #gotitdone #buymeadrinkfirstatleast #workoutandashow #workoutclothesmalfunction #flyonthewallofmylife #zerocareslefttogive #lookthemintheeyeandsmile

Back home today after a rare weekend away from #fourandnomore and my #mancandy while I attended a #photography conference in #bellingham called Photolush. Guys! I won a print award (aptly named a Lushie) hence the golden camera (solid spray paint work there, @jaketswarren). Happy to report I'm back in the south now with some new photo tidbits to torture my clients with. Yep! Who would like to be my next victim? June is coming quick and hopefully the sun will continue to stick around. #bookedtilljune #youlikemeyoureallylikeme #knowbetterdobetter #owethehusbandsomethingfierce #neveraloneagain @photolushnw

Serving up some #momlife #realtalk on my blog this afternoon - link in bio. With #fourandnomore, I've spent nigh on 4 years of my 35 #pregnant and, girl, there are just some details that are too gritty, too real, and too close that not even your #bestie or your #squad will dish the dirt. Read it over and share your thoughts! Did I miss an #unspokentruth that needs to see the light of day? #ninemonthsentence #pregnancylife #bumplife #sobaditsgood #pooptalk

...and all the #seattlekids said amen. While the mamas who were up before 8am trying to locate the snow stuff and then stuffing each child into all. The. #snow. Clothes. grumbled under her breath until they were all shooed outside 30 minutes later. She made a coffee to the soundtrack of excited squeals of laughter. She sat in front of the warm fire with her coffee... ...and all the children started banging on the back door to be let back in. Because #momlife.

Apple crisp. It's one of my favorites. I made some today and all I could hear in my head while slicing and mixing and sprinkling was... closed ears judgement. Not about me or, hopefully, from me. But all around me. Not in my home. But my home country. People don't communicate to change. They communicate to change minds. They are throwing around words like 'complicit' and 'selfish' and 'snowflake' and 'my rights' and then everyone stands around, hands up and superior, and confused why NOTHING EVER CHANGES. Well, friend, guess what? You just lost your ability to make any effective change. The only people listening to you any more are people that ALREADY THINK LIKE YOU. Everyone else, those people who think differently, notice I didn't say WRONGLY, are tuning you out once you take it to that. You've lost all your effectiveness, your clout, your voice in their lives. Let's remember.. unless your social media network is tens of thousands your audience is the people who know and love and care about you most. Its your coworkers and neighbors and friends and family and those few people from high school you can still stand. They are the people you are MOST LIKELY able to influence... until you're right-fighting, holier than thou, superior attitude self destructs that opportunity. You want to talk about guns? YES! Let's do that. Respectfully and with a heart of COMPROMISE... because, SPOILER ALERT, no one is going to be getting everything they want when it comes to gun REFORM. Mental health? Breakdown of the family? Samesies. If you REALLY want change, and not just to be an inflammatory ASSHOLE to your network, put the shock value words and comments you stole from someone else on the back burner and pretend the person is sitting across the dinner table from you and use some freaking manners. ..and I'll be over here with my apple crisp. #makechangenotenemies #howtoadult #compromiseiskey

From #baby to #biggirl in the span of one #morningmakeover. The #cribdays are over for me. For. Ev. Er. Forever. Let's let that sink in. As I was disassembling the last crib I was feeling a little wistful and misty eyed thinking that along with retiring crib bumpers and sleep sacks and, let's be real, a completely irrational fear of SIDS, I was also retiring an entire part of my life as a mom with little, little babies. #motherhood you are so bittersweet. #bedroommakeover #ikeastyle #grumpycat #vintagelinens #girlsbedroominspo

More #freshbabes recently hung for display at #swedishedmonds. Spotlighting a variety of #strong, #tender dads was high on my personal priority list and this image on the left embodies that perfectly! Paired up with those sweet baby rolls on the right and it's basically an #ovaryexplosion.

Swung by my favorite #hospital, #swedishedmonds, to drop off more art for the walls and take a stroll to see what's been installed since my last visit.

I just wanted ten more minutes of eyes closed time. This was the compromise. I hope those ten minutes are worth a face of #adultacne because this cheapo, #madeinchina #makeup kit #Santa brought I'm sure is filled with pore plugging lead and corn starch and formaldehyde and the tiny tears of baby #jeffbezos. #worthit #momlife #undersleepedsince2007 #onlyforevertogo #thisiswhywomenagefaster #kidsandcheapmakeup #blendingskillssuck

This is it. The #sisters I chose. Those who will gently tell you you've gotten a little bit fat, or were wrong, or need a change of heart. Those who are  the #secretkeepers, the #wisdompanel, the #kickyouintheasswhenyouneedit. They know my garbage and I theirs. It's real. Those who see you, REALLY see you. They champion you, your #marriage, your #family, your #spouse, your #children, your #job... your everything. They are a constant source of laughter and joy and snacks and prayer. They are my #Wolfpack. Stronger together. #sisterhood #dolifetogether #dontdolifealone @anhjohnson0724 @sydneyrue @abucking

...and that's a wrap on #Santa2017! My four little elves stopped by the studio with me to clean up after all the festivities. Friend! Are you ready for #Santa2018?

'Come up to #elkcamp for a few days' does not mean what I thought it did... but not in all bad ways. It did mean the fire was out when we awoke (before the sun but after all the men had gone out) so the boys had ample time to learn how to build a fire. #silverlining #dontreadbetweenthelines #survivalskills #makingthebestofit #smokiestfireever #huntingwife #huntinglife

#familyphotos with #fourkids... we survived! Mostly due to the fact I LITERALLY planned this day down to the nth degree to ensure success. We're talking long afternoon naps for EVERYone but me, favorite dinner, promises of ice cream, clothes ready to go days before, perfect weather... #allthethings. And then I remember why this can only be an annual thing... SO. MUCH. WORK. And then they were filthy after playing in a campfire pit in the first five minutes. Legit black charcoal faces and hands and arms and ALL THE PLACES. But I looked hawt so whatevs. #zerocaresleft #momlife #perfectmemories

Daily #ketoeats: quick, ugly #lunch edition. Fried egg atop pan fried cheese (seriously. Cheese in a pan, fry that ish up...

#ketoeats: lunch! Leftovers. Hardboiled eggs from breakfast and veggie/turkey sauté from lunch yesterday. Added some extra turmeric, pink #Himalayansalt, and my favorite #tessamaesdressing.

Somehow they are old enough for #sleepawaycamp and this #mamaheart is experiencing a bit of shock. Conflicted somewhere between FREEEEEEDOM!! And #theyababy is where you'll find me while they are gone for a WEEK. Their cousins (3 of them!) and friends (2!) are along for the memories and our wonderful friend and his wife are the director of #campdonbosco so I'm finding comfort in that. Even IF they didn't kiss their mama goodbye. #turds #growingup #leavingmebehind #bittersweet #summercamp

#nineyearsold, you're kind of #thebestever. Little enough to still want cuddles and snuggles and can be parented by size alone but big enough for #allthechores. #momlife #ihatedishes

When it's #90degrees before noon in a place where more than 75% of homes do not have central air, #Target is the place to be to soak up the AC. Coupled with some #noshameinmygame bribes for good behavior and I can turn a 'quick trip' into a 90+ minute excursion and still only have to spend 10'minutes in the #toyaisle. #parentinghack #momlife #fourandnomore

Trying to figure out a game plan for this is wet mess is actually rather stressful. At the LEAST I'm replacing all batteries, chargers, sync cords, remotes, and memory cards as I was still blowing water out of them this morning. Thankfully, the #mkiii and 5 lenses (3Ls, a #Canon fisheye which was the wetter of the lenses, and a #Sigma) don't show any signs of condensation/fogging/water to the naked eye in the areas I can see. I was rather worried about the battery compartment in the body as that is where the most water was in the camera but that was dry this morning as far as I could tell even with the compartment being closed over night. Do I file an insurance claim? No idea. My business insurance is with the same company as our homeowners and we just had a 80k homeowners claim after #floodpocalypse in our kitchen. I don't want to get dropped... #whenboatssink #camerasdontswimwell #myentirebusinessiscameras #howtostress #dryout #thebigterribleawful
