Yay Luigi!! 😻 This beautiful boy was adopted during our recent Clear the Cat Shelter campaign. He was with us for 2 months before he found a home. “I love Luigi's temperament. I wasn't sure how it would go with our other rescue cat of 9 years, but Luigi was so calm when they first met and tried to groom him on day 1. Such a gentleman. Luigi loves being picked up and cuddled when he's not playing with our other cat. He's a real snuggler. I'll always adopt adult shelter cats. They have loads of years left, and so much love to give.” – Morag . . . #LostDogsHome #adopted #cat #catsofinstagram #instacat#catstagram #catoftheday #pet #petsofinstagram #instapet#petoftheday #shelterpets #rescuepets #sheltercat #rescuecat#instagood #family #love #foreverhome #adoptdontshop

What a great way to end our #Cranbourne pop-up #adoption weekend, with this beautiful senior cat finding his forever #home! 😸🏡 Over just 2 days, 88 cats and kittens were ADOPTED! 😻 At 9.5 years old, Pumba wasn’t a popular choice. He curled up in his favourite box and watched as people came and went with their newly adopted pet. We didn’t think today would be his lucky day. As we were about to start packing up this afternoon, a lovely family came through the doors ready to #adopt a #cat in need. Samuel and Kathryn fell in #love with Pumba's gentle, friendly nature. They weren't put off by his age. In fact, it was a bonus! Here is their first photo together ❤️ Thank you to all the kind people who came along this weekend to adopt and change the life of a homeless #pet. And thank you to all of you who shared our posts to get the word out. Pumba - and many other #cats like him - are now curled up in bed or on the couch with their new families. YOU made this happen! . . . #LostDogsHome #adopted #catsofinstagram #instacat #catstagram #catoftheday #pet #petsofinstagram #instapet #petoftheday #shelterpets #rescuepets #sheltercat #rescuecat #instagood #family #foreverhome #adoptdontshop

Peter was down on his luck after many years of hardship. When a volunteer gardening role became available at The Lost Dogs’ Home, he seized the opportunity to keep active and enjoy his passions – gardening and animals. Whether he’s mowing the lawn, raking leaves, trimming the garden or hanging fairy lights for an adoption event, Peter takes great pride in his work. His first task of the day, though, is to say hello to the shelter dogs 🐶 Peter was recently reunited with his son after 20 years apart. He proudly showed his son around the shelter and shared his admiration for his work and love for the dogs. Peter is one of more than 200 animal-lovers who kindly donate their time to help in a variety of volunteer roles at the Home. We couldn’t do it without them ❤ . . . #LostDogsHome #volunteer #volunteering #gardening #gardener #animals #instagood #feelgood

#Pet lovers of #Melbourne! Our Foster Program is desperately low on #toys and beds for #foster pets. These items give joy and comfort to pets who are too little for #adoption, recovering from surgery, or in need of extra TLC. If you have any of the below items (in good condition) that you don’t need, or if you'd like to buy any as a present, we’d #love to give them to a deserving foster pet ❤️ 1️⃣2️⃣6️⃣0️⃣ pets were placed into foster care over the past year, including more than 8️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ #kittens 😻 Our foster carers do such a wonderful job. We want to make sure they have everything they need to help their foster pets feel at #home 🏡 . . 🐱 Wish list for #cats & kittens - Toys - Food bowls - Beds - Scratching posts - Cat carriers . . 🐶 Wish list for #dogs & #puppies - Enrichment toys such as Kongs - Soft beds - Crates (for dogs recovering from surgery) . . 📍 Drop-off points - North Melbourne shelter: 2 Gracie Street - Cranbourne shelter: 920 Thompsons Road ❤️ THANK YOU for anything you can do to help ❤️

“Puss Cat is a good boy, he just has one eye but he's my best friend.” – Demi, (nearly) 3 years old.

This is Maggie. She came to us in such a sad state; very skinny, dehydrated and with fly-bitten ears. She also had other health issues that needed emergency surgery at our hospital. It’s sad to think that she may never have known human kindness until the day she arrived at our shelter. Maggie has been with us for many weeks and has also spent time in a loving foster home. Nobody has fallen for her more than her foster carer, Melissa. “Once Maggie has become comfortable with a person, she shows unconditional love and gratitude towards them... It will be really sad to see her go, but I hope someone can give her the life she deserves.” Maggie is a special girl looking for a special home where she must have a constant doggy friend. She’s staying at her foster home at the moment, so if you’re interested in adopting her, please call us on (03) 9329 2755 so we can organise for her foster carer to bring her in to the shelter for a meet-and-greet with you. . . . #LostDogsHome #dog #dogstagram #dogsofinstagram #instadog #dogoftheday #shelterdog #rescuedog #pets #petsofinstagram #petstagram #instapet #shelterpets #rescuepets #adopt #adoptme #adoptdontshop #instagood #love

Poor little Oreo has been through so much already 😿 We don’t know what happened to this beautiful kitten in his first months of life, but he came to us with an awful injury. Part of his tail had been pulled off. Oreo never let that dampen his spirit, always seeking smooches and cuddles from his carers at the shelter 🐱💕 Oreo needed surgery at our shelter hospital to amputate part of his tail. He made a smooth recovery under the care of our attendants and vet team, and is now ready to find a safe home. Do you know anyone who’s looking to adopt a furry friend?

This poor ol’ guy came to us after an adventure that could have gone horribly wrong. Turbo climbed up into the engine bay of a car. He was found after the car had been taken for a drive, and had wounds over his body 😿 He was so lucky to have been found before it was too late. Our vet and cattery teams have been taking care of Turbo, nursing him back to health. Thankfully, his injuries weren't severe and have started to heal. Turbo is looking for a safe new home where his adventures will be a little more low key. He’s nearly 12 years old, so is looking forward to a peaceful life of snuggles and chin wags. We'd love for Turbo and his fellow shelter #cats to find new homes as soon as possible, so there's NO FEE to #adopt a #cat and it's HALF PRICE to adopt a #kitten until 11 Feb 2018. Turbo, animal ID 859855 . . . ‪#LostDogsHome #cat #catsofinstagram #instacat #catstagram #instagramcats #catoftheday #sheltercat #rescuecat #rescued #kitty #pet #petsofinstagram #instapet #petoftheday #adoptme #adoptdontshop

This beautiful girl is settling in to her forever home so well ❤ “When I first met Peaches, I fell in love straight away. She was so happy and bouncy and excited by people. She is everything I want in a dog. Since we brought her home, she's loving meeting new people and trying to jump up on the couch. She's taken over one of my teddy bears who she now sleeps with. The Lost Dogs' Home has some beautiful animals in it, all of which I wish I could take home with me. I am so happy that we have been able to give Peaches her new forever home.” – Laura . . . #LostDogsHome #dog #dogstagram #dogsofinstagram #instadog #shelterdog #rescuedog #dogoftheday #pets #petsofinstagram #petstagram #instapet #shelterpets #rescuepets #petoftheday #adopt #adopted #adoptdontshop #love #family #home

Our special boy Chester found a #home today! 😻 Anna came to meet another #cat with special needs, not realising he'd already been #adopted. Our attendants immediately thought of Chester - a special cat who had a rough start to life and had an eye removed. They introduced him to Anna and it was #love at first sight ❤️ Could the story get any better? YES! Anna's friend came with her to our adoptions centre, as she was also on the lookout for a furry companion. She also fell in love and adopted a cat! . . . #LostDogsHome #catsofinstagram #catstagram #catoftheday #rescuecat #kitty #instacat #petsofinstagram #petstagram #instapet #adoption #adoptdontshop #instagood #family

Finally, he was freed from the discomfort.‬ ‪ ‬ ‪Chester loves it when you spend quality time with him, playing and patting. He dreams of finding a #family that will include him in the daily happenings around the #home.

These #kittens came to us separately, but fate brought them together 🐱🐱 Strawberry was left in a box outside our shelter. One of our attendants found her. She was scared, but she was ok. Blueberry was #rescued by our animal ambulance. She had a nasty injury to her right ear, which had likely been there for some time. Strawberry and Blueberry ended up in the same foster homes. That’s where they found #love – possibly for the first time in their lives 🏡❤️ These precious souls are now ready to find forever homes. Do you know anyone who’s looking to adopt?

This beautiful boy found his perfect forever #home a few weeks ago. Yay Ruffy! 🏡❤️ “I haven't had this much joy and laughter in so long! He absolutely loves his new home and as far as I can tell is very taken with his new mum as well. Ruffy's favourite thing to do is lie on the rug next to the couch, preferring to position himself within range of a dangling foot for a lazy scratch. His overall temperament has been very affectionate, sweet, at ease and sometimes very cheeky. Thank you so much for your care and commitment in helping Ruffy in his early days and assisting him in finding his forever home.” – Sammi . . . #LostDogsHome #dog #dogstagram #dogsofinstagram #instadog #shelterdog #rescuedog #pets #petsofinstagram #petstagram #instapet #shelterpets #rescuepets #adopt #adopted #adoptdontshop #love #family

Happiness is… a forever home 🏡 “Fifi has turned into a dog-loving, cuddle obsessed 4-year-old at heart.

Sometimes you’ve got to let your fur down and be a little silly 😸 This is Sox, and she’s looking for a new #home 🏡 Sox enjoys snuggling on the couch, but she can be a little shy at times, so likes to take things at her own pace. Once she feels comfortable, she’ll be asking you for chin rubs and smooches. Sox would love to find a home with teenage kids or just adults, who will let her explore and flourish in her own time. She has lived with other cats in the past and may be happy sharing her new home with another kitty.

Loving home needed 🏡❤ Rafa was only a kitten when he arrived at our shelter, but he’d already been through so much in his short life. He came to us from a house where he was living among more than 50 other cats. Rafa's left eye was missing from the socket, so he needed surgery at our shelter hospital 🏥 He spent time in a foster home to recover from his operation and build his confidence. Rafa's now ready to find a new home. He can be shy at first, but he’s becoming braver by the day. If you give him gentle love and affection, he’ll return the devotion tenfold ❤ Rafa (ID 1033578) is up for #adoption at our North #Melbourne #shelter #LostDogsHome #cat #catsofinstagram #instacat #catstagram #catoftheday #pet #petsofinstagram #instapet #petoftheday #adopt #adoptme #adoptdontshop #shelterpets #rescuepets #sheltercat #rescuecat #home #foreverhome

Loving home needed ❤🏡 Have you got room for 2 sweet kittens? Periwinkle and Simon came to us separately, but fate brought them together when they ended up in the same foster home. That was the start of something special. Peri and Simon really depend on each other, so we can't split them up. They're looking for a home where they can stay together forever 🐱❤🐱 “Peri has taken on a big brother role and shows Simon how to be brave. Simon relies on Peri to help build his confidence. Simon copies everything Peri does. On the other hand, Simon has a calming effect on Peri and shows him how to take a break and relax. Peri is a total clown. When he sees you walk into a room he will instantly start kneading the air. Simon has such an endearing personality. Despite being scared, he still wants to interact and trust you. Someone is going to be so lucky to have Peri and Simon in their life. Peri will be right at the door waiting to greet you when you come home and Simon will be there to warm your lap.” – Gemma, foster carer.

It’s awful to think of the pain he would have endured 😿 Quin needed multiple surgeries to wire his jaw back into place and remove misaligned teeth, which were making it hard for him to eat.

Puss in Boots is only 7 months old, but he's already been through so much hardship 😿 When he arrived at our shelter last month, he was suffering from lots of medical issues that had gone sometime without treatment. Puss in Boots was underweight, had severe cat flu and gum disease. Even more shocking, his right eye was missing from the socket, which was badly infected. It took a team of people – vets, nurses, attendants and a foster carer – to nurse Puss in Boots back to health. And now he needs YOU to help find someone who will give him the #love and #care he deserves for the rest of his life ❤ If you’re not ready for a cat, PLEASE TAG anyone you know who could offer a caring #foreverhome to this #beautiful boy 🏡 Read Puss in Boots’ story @ dogshome.com/puss-in-boots/ #LostDogsHome #cat #catsofinstagram #instacat #catstagram #catoftheday #pet #petsofinstagram #instapet #petoftheday #adopt #adoptme #adoptdontshop #shelterpets #rescuepets #sheltercat #rescuecat #home

Happy #Adoption Day to Amy, who was #adopted from the Home 2 years ago today! She shares her life with a wonderful #family and fellow adoptee, Stanley. 🐶❤️🐶 "Amy and Stanley are each other's best friends. Amy is the louder of the two and enjoys getting her nose into everything. She loves being outside and will always come back inside a lot dirtier than when she went out. She loves chasing after her soft toys, especially after she notices Stanley having too much fun with them, so she makes sure to take them into spots he is too big for. Stanley's favourite place is anywhere inside. He loves being near anyone and loves car rides and walkies, especially when Amy goes too. Shelter dogs make the most wonderful family members. You can see in their eyes how much they love you and enjoy doing everything with you, even if it's just having cuddles on the couch. It makes us sad to think of the life they led before we found them, and being able to give them a great second chance at life is a feeling no words could describe." - Alice #LostDogsHome #dog #dogsofinstagram #dogstagram #instadog #dogoftheday #pet #petsofinstagram #petoftheday #instapet #adoptdontshop #shelterdog #rescuedog #shelterpets #rescuepets #home #foreverhome #love #instagood #bestfriends
