For the first time in five years, I won’t be at the #AIGAretreat, so today’s throwback charts my dubious recent path of professional design leadership: . 2013: naïve newbie 2014: tough troublemaker 2015: minor celebrity 2016: fading spokesman 2017: desperate clown . Warm regards to all my AIGA pals! Don’t do anything on a pool table that I wouldn’t do, especially if you’re not paid for your work. . Also I apparently own exactly three shirts.

Cool stuff on today’s 21-mile #KeirByBike: new playground on the Avenue and new fix-it station (with map!) on West Main just outside town. Not-cool stuff: the fifth flat in a row from a treacherous front tire/inner tube. After so many failed attempts to handle it myself, it’s definitely time to Seek Professional Help. Thanks @ohlneeme for coming to rescue me.

March Mapness 3/31, the finale, is for me: hand-lettered/inked neighborhoods of Ventura, CA. It's not entirely accurate—the names and boundaries are a mix of local travel bureau, municipal, and uh...Nextdoor maps—but it's close enough for this 14-year resident. Also included is a process piece (in pencil, with deleted rural Taylor Ranch, Ortonville and Hillsides areas). Thanks to everyone who requested a map, and thanks in general for the indulgence. More fun map news coming soon, via @tightshipdesign. Stay tuned! . . . #march_mapness #mapillustration #maps #mapdesign

March Mapness 3/25 (belated edition), for @vasha321: "An environment or path of journey travelled from a book you’ve read." I chose to loosely map the journey of the Greek hero Theseus, as told by Mary Renault in her historical fiction novels "The King Must Die" (1958) and "The Bull from the Sea" (1962). I first read them at 13 and was mesmerized. Renault characterized her Theseus as a legend with an inferiority complex: a cunning, womanizing, overcompensating little punk whose insane adventures in an utterly foreign time period were rendered as realistic as possible from a 20th-century perspective. The locations are: Τροιζήν, Ἐλευσίς, Ἀθῆναι, Κρήτη, Νάξος, μάραθον, Πόντος, Ἐπίδαυρος, and Σκύρος. . . . #march_mapness #mapillustration #maps #mapdesign

March Mapness 3/15 on this Throwback Thursday is for me: it’s a Michigan doodle from the 2015 AIGA leadership retreat in Grand Rapids. It was my favorite of the five retreats I attended from 2013-17 and I was definitely “smitten with the mitten” as @aigawm once described it. Didn’t go very well for the U.P. on this one, though 😑 . . . #march_mapness #mapillustration #maps #mapdesign #aigaretreat #tbt

March Mapness 3/11: New Zealand 🇳🇿 for @awapuhi_54. Second slide is a peek at the process.

Because a "best 9" ain't enough, here's 17 for '17 (plus one). This year's big hits: co-launching my first business, visiting two new states/several new cities, warping impressionable minds at multiple schools, staying healthy despite medical scares, and (as always) griping about design/baseball/music/the burning world with anyone who'd listen. Thanks everybody.

Flashback Friday 12/15/97: it's the 20th anniversary of my first band's first CD release! Check out @mybandrocks20 all day for shameless Photoshop mockups of my Mojo Wire album artwork redesigns. I created all-new PDF booklets for all four Mojo Wire albums and set them up on Bandcamp as "digital reissues," because people can be a bit weird about their first band. Especially if their first band was actually three different bands.

Just discovered that #Mapvember is a thing, and while I don’t have anything *new* for #mapvember2017, earlier this year I did organize all my old original made-up/D&D maps going back to about 2003. Some of these are based on the stuff I used as a middle-schooler in the late ‘80s. No names, because I’m re-naming everything!

The modern theater-going experience is degraded to the point of uselessness. However, some films are still worth seeing in theaters. This one is, all 2:45 of it. It's that good.

I'm told that musicians get the biggest cut of their album sales from what's sold at concerts, so I waited til tonight's LA Greek Theatre show to get the latest @thewarondrugs album. They opened with a Tom Petty cover ("Time to Move On") and then kept going up from there. 5th time seeing them, and 2nd time at this venue. Really needed it this week. #ChampionshipVinylCA

Dueling Downtown #Wayfinding: marking the spot where, many years ago, the Gaslamp Map defeated the Marina Map, knocking it sideways with the full force of gentrification. The two maps are now memorialized at the same 20 paces which they faced each other on that fateful day.

Throwback Thursday 5/27/07: rehearsing with Honey White at the Corridan Gallery in SB almost exactly 10 years ago. The band would only get together and jam 4 more times, and that wasn't til Nov/Dec 2010. The Milpas St. gallery was always one of my favorite places to play because of the resonant wood floors and the inspiring art on exhibit. Photo by Owen Salisbury.

Unbelievably, last night's PJ Harvey show at the LA Greek Theatre was the first time I saw her play live. Recent stuff dominated the set, and it sounded great in concert, but the handful of '90s classics near the end definitely brought the house down and warmed us up on an unusually cold May night.

Flashback Friday: my first U2 show, April 28 1997 in San Diego. Forget all this Joshua Tree 30th anniversary stuff--PopMart was sensational, even the early shows like this one (2nd overall of the tour) where the band was definitely still working out the kinks. The venue was called Jack Murphy Stadium back then, and I went with a big crew including @dubiousbryn and @adamhilltri. 20 years is a long time, but it'll melt away under the right circumstances.
