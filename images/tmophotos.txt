Outer reefs of #pipeline from a few years ago.  Super bummed I missed out on a work trip to Maui with some friends I haven’t seen/worked with in way too long. Then Facebook reminded me of this shot.

This canyon in #bearsearsnationalmonument is one of the true hidden gems of Utah.  Super hard to get back into. Once you make it to the end of the road there are some incredible hikes in there.

Huayna Potosí 19974’ to the summit of this monster. I didn’t have any of the proper clothes or equipment to even think of attempting one of these truly amazing peaks. If I ever get a chance to return to this area and northern Peru I will be spending all my time at the unreal elevations of these mountains.

This shot was the start of a pretty cool adventure out into one of the largest lakes in the world at an insane high elevation.  You can take a small boat out onto one of the islands and live with a family for a few nights to really experience the way of life they have out there. It was also the first time I ever felt the effects of high altitude and had to scrap all my plans and just lay low in town and take it easy for a day. If you ever visit this area of the world stock up on school and art supplies in town to give to the kids and schools that are out in the lake.  There is even an entire community that builds houses out of floating reeds and they just drift around the lake

One of the many ladders on the ascent to the top of Putucusi mountain.  This has to be one of the most incredible Machu Picchu sunrise spots I found.  I heard all the ladders were removed and it’s nearly impossible to get back up to the summit now.  I really want to go back and find my way to the top again.

The southern Milky Way over Machu Picchu I probably suffered more for this image than any other photo I attempted in my life.  I spent nearly two weeks in the tiny tourist town on Aguascalientes waiting out weather and scouting the surrounding mountains during torrential rains trying to get to a location with a view of the ruins at night.  It involved a crazy hike up a half a dozen sketchy wet ladders that have since been removed because the hike was too dangerous, a crystal clear night that turned into an insane lightning storm and wrapping myself in garbage bags to stay dry.  Even after all that I would go back to get this shot again. 24shot panoramic

Had to do a seal team 6 move to get this shot while snorkeling in the Galapagos.  These penguins were pretty skittish so I dove under the surface about 50’ away and swam underwater as close as I could.  When I approached the rock I popped the camera above the surface and fired off as many shots as I could before surfacing.  As soon as I broke the surface of the water they took off and swam away.

I flooded my camera housing from going too deep chasing these sharks. (If I was Icarus I would probably have melted off my wings as well). When I got down to to the bottom my nose started bleeding (I didn’t know it at the time). I stayed down there for a few seconds and all the sharks suddenly woke up and started swimming around. The naturalist signaled me to get out of the water so i jumped in the zodiac and pulled my mask to see blood everywhere.  There is nothing like chumming the water with your own blood while swimming with sharks The camera survived a few more weeks of getting punished while traveling on the lowest budget farm animal busses in Peru and Bolivia before dying while shooting the Milky Way in the ruins of Pisac Peru.

More #rainbows from #bearsearsnationalmonument  This section of comb ridge was apparently saved (and renamed to a new monument) in the preliminary maps. It’s absolutely unreal the amount of land that was removed from the #grandstaircase and Bears Ears #nationalmonument Help save these areas and show up to the rally at the capitol this Saturday in Salt Lake City.  The cultural history that will be lost from this decision is unimaginable.  #defendbearsears #standwithbearsears

There is a rally at the capitol this Saturday and on Monday when the official announcement is made.  The maps were released today and Cedar Mesa was actually removed from the monument.  This opens up huge areas to oil wells, uranium mines and coal mines. It’s one of the most culturally rich areas in North America.  #defendbearsears #standwithbearsears

Another massive #Ullr fire from a few years ago on aspen mountain under the gondola.  These were 12-18” logs that were 10’ long. I think this one burned for a few days.

Back in Utah.  The cops showed up to make sure nobody bothered me while I flew around in some stiff winds.  Check out my aerial account for some Utah vids over the next few days @tmoaerials I am resurrecting my Instagram accounts after a few months break.  This account, @tmoaerials @tmopanos @blackrockphotos  will all be getting updates.

Just finished up an amazing @muenchworkshops River trip on the San Juan.  The first half of the trip was rock art and ruins and the second half was deep desert canyon shooting and rafting. The stars and Milky Way we're unreal from down in the narrows.  I missed the super dark sky shots helping everyone but got this one just after a 3/4 full moon  came up behind the canyon. I managed to stand up ducky most of the upper section of the river. I have never tried a sup board but this was pretty damn fun #savethenationalmonuments #defendbearsears #bearsears #utah #nationalmonument

Interior chamber of a ruin on cedar mesa. The outer wall was riddled with little peep holes that were like looking through a straw to a strategic point outside the fort (only way down the other side, other buildings, other routes into the canyon). It was so incredible to be able to wander these ruins so many years after they were abandoned. #defendbearsears #bearsears #utah #savethenationalmonuments

Bears Ears National Monument really should be a National Park.  You could spend a lifetime in these canyons and not find half of what is hidden in the sandstone canyons. #defendbearsears #savethenationalmonuments

Finally got a nice sunset out here after spending the last ten days in Bears Ears with clear blue skies the whole time (no good for timelapse or sunrise/sunset light) I tucked the truck into a juniper forest last night to get out of the wind and sent up the #drone to check out the surroundings. As soon as I got the @arb4x4usa awning set up it actually rained on me for about an hour.  It's been many many years since I have been in a rainstorm in the desert. So much fun exploring this area with full solar power.  The freezer is making ice for my cooler. The quadcopter batteries, computer and cameras are all recharged using the power of the sun. I have been parking at a central location then hiking an area for 2-3 days. It's amazing how long a tank of fuel will last when exploring like this.  #solarpower #getoutstayout #bearsearsnationalmonument #defendbearsears #arb4x4usa  #toyotausa

It's been so much fun exploring the last ten days in Bears Ears. I am moving off the mesa I was on and down into a new area of Comb Ridge.  This whole monument is one of the gems in terms of public lands and American history.  #defendbearsears #utah #bearsearsnationalmonument

There are a lot of canyons like this in #bearsearsnationalmonument, many many hundreds.  At first look you would think meh.  just another sandstone canyon. This one and every one of the canyons I have explored over the past ten days are different.  There are 40 1000+ year old ruins tucked into the right wall and probably more that I didn't see - - #defendbearsears #utah #desert 📷@tmoaerials

It's kind of scary out here at night.  I have been seeing huge cat prints everywhere I have camped since coming down to #bearsears and any little noise or ruffling fabric of the awning totally puts me on edge.  I might have to escape to the mountains for a day or two. I passed through some of the most incredible grassy forest that I have ever seen in utah on the way to arch canyon near #cedarmesa #defendbearsears

Windy dunes are some of the most challenging conditions (for both your gear and yourself) but can also make for some great images.

Balanced rock in @archesnps .  I just finished up an amazing photo workshop with @muenchworkshops and a bunch of really talented students. This is a shot from a while ago during the Perseid meteor shower but we got a chance to shoot the Milky Way behind balanced rock (I was not shooting during the workshop)

It's crazy seeing people posting images of fall colors from around the USA where it's just starting or still looking amazing. It's been a few weeks since we have had leaves on the trees in the high elevations of colorado. Can't wait for a new season to start. We have more snow in the forcast for the next few days!  #blurred #aspen #colorado #autumn #fall #abstract #motion

Thank you so much @polarpro for sending out a huge box of goodies to trick out the phantom 3 quad.  PolarPro is now making gimbal guards (very nice and mandatory accessory for the p3 in my opinion) and they have a gimbal lock that is far easier to use than the crazy puzzle that Dji ships with the gimbal.  It's not a good idea to carry or store the quad without something to hold the camera in place.  The best part of all was the new filters. The neutral density gradient filters are absolutely amazing for getting even exposure between the sky and ground without having to bracket the photos and the huge assortment of solid nd filters will tame the shutter speeds for shooting video or long exposure still photos. I am not sure what I would do without these filters. If you shoot video with a p3 you really need to get at lease a set of nd filters (nd8, nd16,nd32 or the newest nd64). They screw right on to the phantom lens and hardly weigh anything. #teampolarpro
