This is called a zukin. Kids are required to have one at school and wear it when there is an emergency situation. His French school supplied one but his Japanese school required that we purchase one. It‚Äôs literally a pillow with a strap. Some shops sell for $100. I think a hard hat makes more sense - I took a course in emergency evacuation and it protects your head from hard objects.

Sometimes I think that Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea are less about the rides and more about matching outfits, popcorn buckets and flavored popcorn. üçøThe lines for popcorn rival Dole Whip at the OG Disneyland. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The available flavors on our most recent trip included: *Milk Chocolateüç´ *Blueberry *Herb-Tomato (tasted like pizza)üçï *Curry *Garlic Shrimpüç§ *Caramel *Salt *Black Pepper ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä We used a few websites to figure out which ones were vegan and we all really liked Herb-Tomato. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä If you don‚Äôt like the available bucket at your popcorn stand of choice there‚Äôs a store where you can purchase a different popcorn bucket (they are really well made) with a voucher for popcorn. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä For the record we really miss Disneyland and California Adventure. #LALove ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #disneyphile #disneyig #disneyfood #disneypopcorn #tokyodisneysea #tokyodisney #popcorn #flavoredpopcorn #disneysea #disneyfan

The Japanese micro season or k≈ç for June 16 - 20 is "Plums Turn Yellow" Ume no mi kibamu. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Ume is the word for plum in Japanese, however Japanese plums are similar to apricots. Back in March we experienced beautiful ume blossoms that bloomed well before the sakura üå∏ (cherry blossoms). ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä In the past week or so plums in Tokyo have ripened and are starting to litter the streets. In fact, the very first "free fruit" box I have seen here had plums in it. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Umeboshi is pickled or salted plum. We've eaten it in onigiri üçô and sometimes I chop it up and put on top of riceüçö. We also buy a vegan plum salt that we sprinkle on rice. It's purple and looks really pretty. There's also an alcoholic drink ü•Émade from umeboshi. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä When we were enjoying the ume blossoms there was a little stand with hot tea and hot ginger with ume and it was quite delicious. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #Japan #japanüáØüáµ #Seasons #Microseason #72microseasons #Sekki #Ko #Ume #Umeboshi #Plums

The Japanese micro season or ko for June 11-15 is ‚ÄúRotten grass becomes fireflies‚Äù Kusaretaru kusa hotaru to naru. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Ripley and I saw glowing fireflies in a little patch of grass (it wasn‚Äôt rotten, ha) when we were on Ishigaki Island - it was as if they were reflecting the stars in the sky. üåü We don‚Äôt have fireflies on the west coast of the US and Canada, and I never see stars in Tokyo because of the light pollution, so it was a truly magical moment. I believe that fireflies are one of the few magical things left in the mundane world. üí´ ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä In a week or so we are going to enjoy watching two types of Japanese fireflies twinkling about in a botanical garden.

#yourdailytree is a metasequoia. üå≤ A tad smaller than the sequoia in Norcal where you will find some the largest trees in the world. Nevertheless, some of the Americans in our walking group paused and thought of home.

It‚Äôs important for your physical and mental health to take a moment and enjoy and be grateful for the things that make you genuinely smile. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Positivity is good for your health (not removing negativity but rather increasing positivity). Fake smiles (the ones where you smile with your mouth but not your eyes) are literally bad for your health. Your body knows when you‚Äôre faking it. Our brain and body are connected and yet because specialists work on specific areas of our bodies they have been researched as disconnected and that information gets relayed to us. I highly recommend Barbara Fredrickson‚Äôs research on positivity if you are interested in learning more. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The things that have made me genuinely smile this morning are: - when Ripley made a funny comment about people who try to be zen - a kid that walks to school every morning like his teeth are getting pulled out - Ripley‚Äôs bus chaperone showing us his phone with a selfie that Ripley took with his fingers up his nose - these bikes ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä And it‚Äôs not even 8:30am.

Today was the final Cub Scouts meeting of the school year. Ripley earned many belt loops and patches today for making, growing, outdoorsing and learning about the Japanese culture (like Shinto religion). He was the only one to receive a ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù badge for making the best working catapult out of popsicle sticks so that made his day. The Boy Scouts organization has its faults, but is getting better. I appreciate that it‚Äôs international but locally relevant and encourages being in nature, learning about a variety of topics and how to be a productive and thoughtful member of society. This pack welcomed Ripley immediately and we are so grateful to the caring family who runs it. I was a Brownie and Girl Guide and Sean was a Boy Scout and we‚Äôve got mad skills! ;) Thank you Far East Council Pack 5 in Tokyo!

Rainy season (June) is starting to hit Tokyo. ‚òîÔ∏è We missed it last year because we moved here in August. What we did learn is that you must be very diligent about dehumidifying on the daily otherwise your stuff will get moldy. We have mini dehumidifiers all over the house and a machine that sucks up all the moisture. The seasonal changes here have been quite something to experience. We had it easy in LA except for the whole drought thing. It‚Äôs funny, I left Vancouver for California because I was sick of the rain and now I am glad for it.

Reducing nature deficit disorder (and related imagination deficit disorder) one outdoor playdate at a time. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä We went to the Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park that‚Äôs very near to Haneda Airport.

The butterflies loved Sean‚Äôs legs. And the Japanese tourists loved taking photos of Sean‚Äôs legs covered in tattoos and butterflies. ü¶ã

We took a water buffalo cart to and from Iriomote Island and super tiny Yuba Island. The island seems to be only a park - they had baby Asian Water Buffalo (I want one!) and pretty flowers and butterflies. I preferred this ride over Taketomi Island because the buffalo walked through water, and they had a bathing spot. They were well taken care of - after each ride (15 mins) they were unharnessed, brushed, fed and sometimes watered down. I‚Äôm in love with their fuwafuwa mimis (fluffy ears) and long eye lashes. üêÉüèù . . . . . #japantravel #okinawa #iriomote #yuba #yaeyama #ryuku #waterbuffalo #waterbuffalocart #asianwaterbuffalo #tropicalisland #expatlife

In the Berkeley Science of Happiness course I learned about the power of having ‚Äúawe‚Äù moments. This remote spot on Iriomote island definitely fit the bill, in fact I think my jaw actually dropped open when we stepped out of the car to take it all in. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä If I had taken a pano you would see that green hills surrounded us on all sides and this serene inlet stretched out before us. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Iriomote is called the Galapagos of Asia and one of the last frontiers of Japan. I hope it stays this way ‚Äî a lot of the island is designated national park and you can‚Äôt trek through the jungle without permission, so crossing my fingers.

This is Kabira Bay. It‚Äôs a famous spot on Ishigaki Island. It looks pretty, right? We took a tin can with a plexiglass bottom out to see fish üê†. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä I booked it for Rips before he learned to snorkel. I thought we would just slowly meander the bay, but no. The captain would spot something and call it out, the passengers would cheer and then he would motor back and forth over the same spot. Then he did it when a turtle üê¢ was spotted. I wanted to cry. I wanted to get out. The real devastation was all the dead coral. We saw one purple coral and everything else was brown. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä On the plus side, Ripley and I talked about the coral and I told him about Reef Quest, a citizen science organization created by a kid named Dylan in LA to crowdsource photographing reefs üì∏ to track and help protect them. Rips said he wants to take part because he thought the coral should be colorful üåà and not broken and brown. He also hated that the boat was disturbing the turtle. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä We can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt shield our kids from this stuff because hopefully something will bother them so much they will want to do something about it, whether it‚Äôs taking pics, writing to politicians or choosing a career in that field. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä From Japan Times, ‚ÄúRoughly 90 percent of Yaeyama‚Äôs coral was bleached in 2016 and, according to the Environment Ministry, more than 70 percent of the largest reef, the Sekisei Lagoon, died. In January, the ministry reported that roughly 49 percent of the remaining coral was bleached in 2017; we still don‚Äôt have accurate figures on how much has died. None of this is normal.‚Äù ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #yaeyama #okinawa #ishigaki shigaki #kabirabay #coral #deadcoral #coralbleaching #climatechange #japan

#yourdailytree üå≤ is technically a herb but we don‚Äôt care because bananas üçå are delicious. Seeing them always signals tropical paradise to me. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä This variety is called a shima banana, aka island üèù banana or monkey üêµ banana. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä In Okinawa it‚Äôs commonly found growing around residential areas and fields like where I took these photos.

This is the only female cart pulling water buffalo on Taketomi. She‚Äôs popular because she wears a flower not because she‚Äôs female. Oh Japan.  BTW European water buffalo have curved horns and are pretty lazy and Asian water buffalo have straight horns and just get the job done. I am in love with them all and want to take them home with me.

#yourdailytree üå¥ is a sago cycad (also known as the sago palm, although this is a misnomer as cycads are not palms). Sotetsu in Japanese „ÇΩ„ÉÜ„ÉÑ. This plant is native to the Ryuku Islands in Japan üèùüóæ where we are currently vacationing. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The yellow cone means that this is a male sago cycad. It has giant seeds that are NOT edible ü§¢. In fact, all parts of the plant are toxic and the seeds contain the highest level of the toxin cycasin ‚ò†Ô∏è. Cycasin causes gastrointestinal irritation, and in high enough doses, leads to liver failure. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Most pets die if they eat it, and the problem is they think it‚Äôs a tasty plant. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Starch is extracted from the plant‚Äôs pith (tissue in the stem), which is used like tapioca or potato starch, but it requires a lot of care to extract for obvious reasons. Palm starch seems like a better idea to me! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #moretreesplease #toxictrees #treeswithbenefits #knowyourtrees #foraging #sago #sagopalm #japantravel #yaeyama #ishigaki #okinawa

We‚Äôve seen this cat stroller quite a few times now and this time decided to take a closer look. Rips counted and he said there are 10 kitties but it‚Äôs hard to say because they are tucked in all over the place. The undercarriage has a litter box ‚Äî not really sure how they get to it. I‚Äôm curious how the owner trains them all to be so damn chill. Is he making money off these cars or is he just a super cat person? The owner doesn‚Äôt seem very friendly but he does constantly comb the kitties so they look perfect for your photo. I‚Äôm sure I can google and figure it all out but for now I‚Äôll just make up stories in my head.

For longer than I can remember I‚Äôve been learning about the benefits of being in nature, and for the past 6 months I‚Äôve been more serious about researching the topic specifically focused on mental and physical health. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Sure, I post #yourdailytree üå≤ but IG isn‚Äôt the best medium to share beyond images.

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #yourdailytree üå≤ was once a person. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä I posted about this eco-friendly burial method 2 years ago but it looks like more people are talking about it now. Literally every month or so I remind Sean that this is what I want - to be placed in the burial egg ü•öwith my mushroom death shroud on. In fact I am going to put it into my will because it‚Äôs very important to me that my wishes are carried out. Heck, I probably should just buy the egg now. The question is, where can my egg be buried that isn‚Äôt a cemetery and where my tree can grow? ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Capsula Mundi is a fully biodegradable urn. An egg planted in the ground and a young tree, chosen in life by the deceased, on top of it as a legacy for the future. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä FAQs What does the name Capsula Mundi mean? It is a Latin construction that recalls the transformations of our body between the mineral, vegetal and animal worlds: the three key elements of life on Earth. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä How does Capsula Mundi interact with the soil? The¬†material used for the Capsula¬†does not impede the natural transformation of organic substances from which we are made. In time, the transformation process will bring the body to mineralization, due to the action of microorganisms in the soil. Minerals are nourishment for the plant world and therefore for the tree planted over the Capsula. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä What is the process for burial and how do you manage rigor mortis? The body will be laid down in the Capsula in a fetal position before rigor mortis set in or after it passes. After rigor mortis passes, the body will again become soft and malleable. Once the body is laid within the Capsula, it will be planted in the earth like a seed. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä How can you locate the tree of your deceased loved ones in the sacred forest? The trees will not bear any kind of sign or marking, however each tree will be plotted on a GPS system, so that you will easily be able to locate the tree that memorializes your departed loved one. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #moretreesplease #sacredforest #memoryforest #greenburial #ecofriendly #urn #ecogreen #burial #instatree #treelovers #treesofinstagram

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #yourdailytree üå≤ fights on. (This story may require some ü§ß tissues). ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The only pine tree out of 70,000 that survived the 2011 tsunami on the beach in Minami-Soma, Japan and became a symbol of resilience was cut down on Dec. 27, 2017. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä A ceremony was held on the beach to bid farewell to ‚Äúthe lone pine of Kashima.‚Äù ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚ÄúWe received great strength and moral support from you,‚Äù Kazuo Goga, 77, leader of a volunteer group that worked to preserve the tree, said in a speech at the ceremony. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The Great East Japan Earthquake spawned a tsunami that washed away the thousands of 100 and 200 year old trees on March 11, 2011. Other trees later died after being submerged in seawater for a prolonged period. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä This tree was the sole survivor but then started to die because despite all the valiant efforts, nature had other plans (16 feet of steel was pounded into the earth around the tree plus a caisson to pump the seawater away from infiltrating its roots). ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The decision was made to fell the pine tree because the entire coastal area is scheduled to be tidied up for the creation of a new disaster prevention forest. The decision did not come lightly, keep in mind that more than 20,000 people lost their lives so this tree was very much a symbol of strength and resilience to the survivors. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Wood from the tree will be used mainly for nameplates on the home of local residents. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä But this isn‚Äôt the end of the Lone Pine/Tree of Hope/Miracle Tree, in order to preserve its DNA, cuttings from it‚Äôs branches were grafted onto similar trees that are growing in a nursery and will one day be transplanted ‚ù§Ô∏è. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #moretreesplease #pinetree #lonepine #japan #fukushima #tsunami #2011 #311 #fighton #treeofhope #miracletree

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #yourdailytree üå≤ found the perfect tree to sit under and read the new Forest Bathing book üìñ that came out by Dr. Qing Li. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä This is a sakura tree, not too long ago it was full of blossoms, however, they are hakanai (fleeting) and so now the tree has a new purpose - to provide me with a backrest and shade. ü§ó ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä The days are starting to get hot here in Tokyo and yet I don‚Äôt want to be stuck inside all day using A/C. If you get to the park before noon, then it‚Äôs still cool enough to chillax without a lot of people around and avoid the oppressive heat and humidity. (BTW, cities with a lot of tree canopy can help keep everyone cool and cut down on A/C). ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä My challenge this year is to read 50 books, I think I‚Äôm half way there.

#yourdailytree has a deadly scream! üò±üå≤ j/k this isn‚Äôt a Mandrake from Harry Potter üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è which will kill you if you hear it scream, but we bought it because it looks like one. Swipe ‚¨ÖÔ∏è to compare between this tree and a mandrake. This is actually a ficus microcarpa ginseng plant. ‚ÄúGinseng‚Äù is a Chinese word for roots. And what cool roots it has. Fun fact - the branches are actually crafted onto the trunk. This plant is super easy to care for. It requires indirect light and minimal watering. It‚Äôs a great first bonsai because they are quite forgiving to mistakes. They will cry like a Mandrake baby if you move them so pick a spot and leave it! üò≠ . . . . . #moretreesplease #instadaily #bonsai #ficus #easyplants #ginseng #ficus #houseplants #indoorplants #harrypotterbooks #mandrake #harrypotterfandom #plantsmakepeoplehappy #instadaily #instatree #treesofig #houseplantclub

#yourdailytree gets educated üå≤üë©‚Äçüéì. Today is Earth Day and I think one of the best things anyone can do for our planet is to get more knowledgeable about nature and how to care for it and treat it with the respect it deserves. We are part of the ecosystem not some sidelined observer. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I am doing these daily tree posts is to educate myself and share with others. Walking around Tokyo you‚Äôll find trees and shrubs and flowers with name labels. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to educate the public. Today, thanks to the label, I learned that this is a „Åè„Åô„ÅÆ„Åç kusunoki tree which is a camphor tree. It‚Äôs native to SE Asia and you may know that camphor oil exhibits many health benefits. I wish you a wonderful day celebrating how fortunate we are to be alive on this beautiful and wondrous spinning rock. üåéüåçüåè . . . . . #moretreesplease #earthday #earthday2018 #earthdayeveryday #japan #tokyo #naturewalk #savoringwalk #educational #treeeducational #dailytree #treesofinstagram #igtrees

#yourdailytree inspects the empty lot next door. üå≤üßê I recall reading an article about getting your kids into nature and the author suggested that if you don‚Äôt have access to a park or green space then to explore empty lots. My son is getting over a bad cold so we decided to stay close to home. He wanted to do some crafting and needed sticks so we walked around to the back of our house to search üîé in the empty lot. We had fun - we saw butterflies, discovered what look very much like California poppies and of course found the perfect sticks. I‚Äôm very grateful to that tiny but mighty leafy lot üå±because we are tucked in closely to our neighbors‚Äô houses and the tall trees prevent me from feeling claustrophobic and pinned in. The trees and flowers attract birds and butterflies ü¶ã (including a giant black species that can be mistaken for a bat) ü¶á that I can view from my balcony. Some research I came across ‚Äî In Cleveland, Ohio there are 27,000 ‚Äúferal‚Äù lots. A study looked at 53 of them and discovered vacant lots contained three times more trees and twice the leaf biomass found in other settings. On a per-hectare basis they sequestered more carbon, removed more atmospheric pollutants, prevented more stormwater runoff, and‚Äîby blocking wind and casting shade‚Äîsaved more energy than the trees on residential and suburban lots. üëå So next time you see an empty lot, maybe you‚Äôll think twice before considering it an eyesore and instead a gift from and for nature. ‚ù§Ô∏èüå≤ . . . . . #moretreesplease #vacantlot #emptylot #urbanspaces #instadaily #instatree #treesofig #naturefinds #japan #tokyo #smallspaces #expatlife #gaijin #canadianexpat #americanexpat

#yourdailytree had to get up with the early birds to get this shot in Yoyogi Park without people in it! üå≤üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like people, I‚Äôm just comfortable being hitori de (alone) a lot and as part of my mental and physical health practice I like to hangout in nature without the distraction of lots of other people. Which there are a lot of here in Tokyo, the largest metro area in the world. You might ask, why the heck did you move there if you don‚Äôt like being around lots of people? Well, Japan is marvelous and and the countryside is a sight to behold. Tokyo is incredible and mind blowing in small doses. The husband‚Äôs office is in Shibuya and there is only one French school in the area, so we did our best to find a quiet neighborhood. Almost every week day I get into green areas and escape to the country on weekends. I am privileged to live in Japan and I hope to one day move closer to the countryside here or back in the PNW where I can have goats and a horse again üê¥üêêand see monkeys in my backyard. üêí . . . . . #moretreesplease #koen #park #urbanpark #greenspace #tokyo #tokyolife #expatlife #japantravel

#yourdailytree loves birds and birds love me. üå≤üê¶ I was running through Yoyogi Park, the largest urban park in Tokyo, when I came upon this little bird house with two puffy birds hanging out on its peak. I looked a little closer at the house and saw the stamp ‚ÄúWild Bird Society of Japan.‚Äù The thing that‚Äôs awesome about birding is that you hangout around trees and learn a lot about them in addition to birds, being their habitat and all. The purpose of wild bird societies‚Äô is to educate and protect birds and their habitats. Protect birds AND trees. Win Win in my book. üå≤‚ù§Ô∏èü¶âIf you get the chance, I highly recommend participating in at least one bird watching walkabout, I used to do them all the time in Los Angeles. It‚Äôs a great way to meet new people, discover new places, see birds you probably wouldn‚Äôt notice on your own, and get outside! . . . . . #moretreesplease #japan #woodland #urbanpark #birdhouse #wildlife #birders #wildbirds

#yourdailytree enjoyed the view with those that have passed on. üå≤üèîRips and I were in search of macaques üêí and needed to get closer to the trees, so we walked up a hidden path lined by bamboo and came upon this cemetery. You come across many of them around the countryside but this one is my favorite. Tucked in among the trees it felt really peaceful and enchanting. I thought maybe some kodama (Japanese forest spirits were lingering about). üßöüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here‚Äôs something I learned recently related to chopstick etiquette and the dead ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚Äî most Japanese people are cremated, the relatives go back and pick the bones out of the ashes and transfer them to an urn ‚ö±Ô∏è using large chopsticks or metal picks. Sometimes, two relatives will hold the same bone at the same time with their chopsticks in order to move it. This is the only time in Japan when it is proper for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. ü•¢ . . . . . #moretreesplease #japan #countryside #cemetary #vista #morningmist #scenicview #kodama #yama #forest #forestspirit

#yourdailytree is a ki no isha (tree doctor). üå≤üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è. In her BBC series about trees, Judi Dench has a tree stethoscope and was listening to water flowing through vessels in her oak tree, so we wanted to give it a try. This isn‚Äôt the right kind of stethoscope and you want to listen to hardwoods in the spring time when the water and sap is flowing. Bamboos are hollow so it didn‚Äôt work but Rips had fun. #stemeducation #bambooforest #japan #fukushima

#yourdailytree is monkeying around with kids in a forest park. üå≤ Not only did trees provide the logs for the 40 activity structures in this athletic park for children, but these trees mask the concrete jungle surrounding the park. They muffle the sounds from the nearby streets and create an eye-soothing canopy of green. The trees also absorb the dust and wind (it was a seriously blustery day today) and reduced  glare when the sun made an appearance. Not to mention blocking the UV rays. Oh and of course trees reduce all the pollutants in the air. . . . . . #moretreesplease #treesarelife #airpollution #uvprotection #dust #wind #adventurepark #japan #tokyo #tokyokids #playdate #playground

#yourdailytree is spending time in a Japanese garden with kids. üå≤ This park is called Rikugi-en and was constructed between 1695 and 1702. The benefits to getting kids outside and into nature are numerous. I became a member of the Children & Nature Network because I feel so strongly about it. Here are a few research backed reasons: 1. It encourages exercise. The kids I was with were running and hopping and jumping and climbing all around the park. One study found that the physical activity of 11 to 13 year olds rose relative to the amount of tree-filled space in their neighborhoods. 2. It reduces anxiety. Granted we are in a very zen Japanese garden, but the kids sat in a shelter and calmly drew the beautiful setting before them. 3. It improves focus. One study of kids in Illinois found that even just a twenty-minute walk in the park led to a substantial attention boost. And some other research has shown that it helps kids better connect to their community and family and even increase their interest in the environment. . . . . . #moretreesplease #trees #tree #instadaily #park #naturekids #naturelovers #japan #japanpark #tokyolife

Rips took pics of me at my first archery class. The entire lesson was in Japanese (10 weeks of nihongo lessons does not begin to cover all that vocab!) but thankfully the visual instruction and kindness of two fellow classmates translating for me got me through. And the staff was so kind and watched Rips for me and made sure he could safely take pics. My first try was not so good but it made me laugh. My subsequent attempts landed me a few bulls eyes! I had so much fun. üèπ

#yourdailytree is rare. üå≤üåº This is a very rare kind of sakura called Ukon. The name Ukonzakura comes from its color resembling textiles dyed with ukon (turmeric) stem and root. I was looking at the tree wondering if it was a sakura because it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen this color, when a man came up and explained to me how rare it was.

#yourdailytree is ephemeral. üå≤üå∏üëã Just a few days ago this tree in my hood was full of pink sakura blooms. Now they are almost gone and little green leaves have taken over. SWIPE üëÜ to compare before and after. As Ferris Bueller said, ‚ÄúLife moves pretty fast. If you don‚Äôt stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.‚Äù . . . . . #moretreesplease #sakura #sakura2018 #japan #tokyo #shibuya #expatlife #beforeandafter

#yourdailytree is not forgotten. üå≤üå∏ ‚õ© We came across this shinto shrine named Kibune when we went for our morning constitutional (walk not üí©) to checkout Odaka. It was incredibly quiet on the streets. We passed a few people and a handful of cars drove by. It was the relief I needed from the mega metropolis that I now call home. People have been slowly returning to Odaka and surrounding towns after the trifecta disaster so there‚Äôs hardly anyone here. It‚Äôs really a bizarre feeling to only hear birds and the sound of the river after coming from Shibuya where you can‚Äôt hear yourself think. And the air was so clean smelling. I didn‚Äôt have a particulate sensor with me, but with few cars and lack of people to burn, etc. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs pretty great air quality. üëÉAnyway, the bell in the shrine didn‚Äôt work because it was rusted and the offering box was full of cobwebs, but the grounds were taken care of. It had one of the most beautiful cedar trees I‚Äôve ever seen. Not too far from here, across the river and into the woods is where we saw macaques (Japanese snow monkeys). Most people think they need to see the monkeys in Nagano where they lounge in hot springs, but nope. They live all over Japan üóæ and I saw them hanging in the trees and fields here. ‚úÖüõ¢üìãüêµ . . . . . #moretreesplease #treesofinstagram #igtrees #dailyig #instadaily #sakura #sakura2018 #üå∏ #japan #fukushima #odaka #minamisoma #shintoshrine #countryside

#yourdailytree visits Fukushima. üå≤üå∏ This is Odaka shrine. ‚õ© It‚Äôs far north from Tokyo and so I didn‚Äôt expect to see blooms but the sakura trees are blooming here early. This is very near to where many people lost their lives after the March 11th, 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear plant meltdown. üòû Our host said it wasn‚Äôt until recently that people started to visit the shrine again and yet the sakura trees bloomed each year without anyone to admire them. (I wonder if the trees feel happy to be cherished again). I thought it was time that I visited the area where the #Safecast team has been spending much of their time these past 7 years to work with residents to collect radiation data. I have the honor to live in Japan because Sean is part of the Safecast team. More photos to come of my visit. On a more entertaining note, this is one of the three shrines that sponsor the 1000 year old Samurai horse festival in July. üêé . . . . . #moretreesplease #trees #tree #sakura #sakura2018 #fukushima #jinja #shintoshrine #japan #japantravel

#yourdailytree is poppin‚Äô üå≤üå∏ This little tree is in our neighborhood and we thought it was unique but then I read this tidbit ‚Äúthe color of some varieties' cherry blossoms may change while they are in bloom. For example, a blossom may open as a white flower and change color to pink over the course of a few days.‚Äù Waaaaaaa. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs changing colors or has two different colored blooms.

#yourdailytree is a loner. üå≤üå∏ There is something really special about walking through a valley of evergreens and then coming across a lone sakura tree. The color pops brighter. The joy of discovering it is stronger. There aren‚Äôt a million people crowded around trying to get their selfie with it.

#yourdailytree escapes the sakura crowds. üå≤üå∏ I was feeling a bit wiped after being around a lot of people on Saturday, so we decided to go on a nature break away from the photo snappers. We ended up at Todoroki Valley, the only one in all of Tokyo. It was absolutely lovely and I‚Äôll definitely be back. There was a quiet walk alongside a river, lots of shrines, a Japanese garden, and a waterfall that is used by Shugendo followers for ascetic, mountain-dwelling practices since a long long time ago. Oh and there were sakura! Even room for a proper hanami so I sat down and ate some fruit and crackers under a tree even though I didn‚Äôt have a tarp. ü§£ There is a belief that by spending time in this valley you will feel rejuvenated. This ‚Äúpower spot‚Äù is believed to contribute to replenish your energies and to keep you healthy‚Äîor as the Japanese say: genki (fit, healthy, cheerful, full of energy). . . . . . #moretreesplease #japan #tokyo #sakura #valley #forestbathing #shinrinyoku

This first photo is taken by a very fun woman that was on our hanami boat ride. I got up the courage to ask her to take our photo, in Japanese. She got down low in the middle of our boat to take the shots. We shared lots of giggles. After the ride was over she and her friends waved to us. It‚Äôs not easy making a connection living in a mega city that has more people than your entire native country. The next two pics are selfies. And are blas√©. I‚Äôve come to really dislike selfies. If you are out in the world as opposed to home alone, they signal to me that perhaps you can‚Äôt be bothered with anyone else enough to ask them for assistance in taking your photo. Or you feel bad asking. Or you are worried they will take a bad photo. Or you are in a hurry to go do whatever. Harsh? Perhaps. l‚Äôm not trying to judge you if that‚Äôs your artistic expression. But consider my POV. Research has proven that as a whole we are a much lonelier society. We have fewer friends. We make fewer close connections. So, next time you want a photo of yourself, consider reaching out to another human and asking them to take a shot. Make a connection. It may unexpectedly brighten your day. #hanami #sakura

#yourdailytree is a mournful yet hopeful tree. üå≤ üòî Known as the ‚Äòmournful tree‚Äô by the Greeks and the Romans, the cypress tree was sacred to the Fates and Furies as well as the rulers of the underworld. The tree would be planted by a grave, in front of the house or vestibule as a warning against outsiders entering a place corrupted by a dead body. Romans would carry branches of cypress as a sign of respect and bodies of the respected were placed upon cypress branches previous to interment. üåø It is such for reasons as this that the tree still survives in the Muslim world and in Western culture, the cypress designates hope, as the tree points to the heavens. üôè Here, there is a great continuity of usage for the tree, as despite its cultural interchange, it still remains understood for the same purposes in death. . . . . . #moretreesplease #cypress #tree #trees #mourning

#yourdailytree represents üå∏. This very tree is used by the Japan Meteorological Agency to officially determine the start of cherry blossom (sakura) season in Tokyo. Each prefecture has a designated ‚Äúindex tree‚Äù to report kaika (first blossoms) and mankai (full bloom).

#yourdailytree is honorable and sacred.üå≤üôè It is believed that Japanese deities inhabit certain natural objects such as rocks and trees. Many shrines in Japan are located in forests known as ‚ÄúChinju-no-mori‚Äù (guardian trees). Because they are sacred, these wooded areas have been preserved, so there are many such trees that are hundreds of years old. These include cedars, camphor trees, and Japanese tabunoki trees. A giant sacred tree is called a ‚ÄúGoshinboku‚Äù and is marked by a shimenawa or sacred rope. Written as Honorable (Go) Sacred (Shin) Tree (boku) these particular revered trees indicate the spots where the divinities descended to Earth. . . . . . #moretreesplease #respect #trees #japan #goshinboku #sacredtree #shinto #igtrees #instatree

#yourdailytree is a crime buster! üå≤üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èUniversity studies have shown a reduction in minor crimes as well as domestic aggression and violence due to trees in the environment.üå≤üëÄ Fast Facts from UofW Urban Forestry Research: ‚û°Ô∏èThere are, on average, about 3,800 crime victims per 100,000 population in the U.S. each year. Among minor crimes, there is less graffiti, vandalism, and littering in outdoor spaces with natural landscapes than in comparable plant-less spaces. ‚û°Ô∏èPublic housing residents with nearby trees and natural landscapes reported 25% fewer acts of domestic aggression and violence. ‚û°Ô∏èPublic housing buildings with greater amounts of vegetation had 52% fewer total crimes, 48% fewer property crimes, and 56% fewer violent crimes than buildings with low amounts of vegetation. ‚û°Ô∏èStudies of residential neighborhoods found that property crimes were less frequent when there were trees in the right-of-way, and more abundant vegetation around a house. ‚û°Ô∏èIn a study of community policing innovations, there was a 20% overall decrease in calls to police from the parts of town that received location-specific treatments. Cleaning up vacant lots was one of the most effective treatment strategies. ‚û°Ô∏èVegetation can be managed to create a reassuring environment, reduce fear, and increase citizen surveillance and defensible space. Principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) suggest how to achieve safer places.üíö . . . . . #moretreesplease #arbordayfoundation #urbanforest #tree #trees #crimeprevention #urbantrees #greentrees #instadaily #igtrees #instatree

I‚Äôve been pondering on this post by the very talented @bymariandrew and will now attempt to share my thoughts. For the past month I‚Äôve been taking a course on the science of happiness and reading a lot of research on mindfulness and so that‚Äôs why I am digging in more than just giving it a like. Initially when I read her post, I thought, yep, I wrote my early life narrative very much like she wrote #1. And so naturally I thought about writing it with a different lens on to see if I could achieve #2. But then I thought about something I learned in class ‚Äî we are happier if we accept ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions just as we accept ‚Äúpositive‚Äù emotions. Our emotions, positive and negative are not mutually exclusive; there aren‚Äôt 2 separate narratives but rather 1 narrative (we are one person after all) that has a range of emotions and they are intertwined. We need to learn to accept them all and refuse to shame ourselves or let society shame us for thinking in ways it deems unacceptable. I know I felt bad and sad about many things growing up and that it continues to affect me in my adult life. I can‚Äôt rewrite those feelings, but I can try to remember the positive feelings that I also had. June Gruber‚Äôs research shows that we are happier if we build acceptance of our current emotional state, whatever it may be, instead of pursuing happiness. So when you are feeling a negative emotion, instead of being even more upset or even mad at yourself for feeling that way, to sit with it and to accept it. Through meditation I have been learning to ‚Äúnote‚Äù my feelings and now after a lot of practice am now more quickly able to move on from it and not dwell in that emotional state for too long.

#yourdailytree has big (c)ones.üå≤ The Coulter Pine, native to the coastal mountains of Southern California and northern Baja California, üå¥ produces the largest cone of all pine trees. The large, spiny cones are 20‚Äì40 cm (7.9‚Äì15.7 in) long, and weigh 2‚Äì5 kg (4.4‚Äì11.0 lb) when fresh. They go for about $15 on eBay.

#yourdailytree is smarter than Snow White. üå≤üçè‚ò†Ô∏è According to the Guinness Book of World Records this is the most dangerous tree. A member of the spurge family, this endangered tree is the manchineel (Hippomane mancinella) of the Florida Everglades and the Caribbean coast. üå¥The sap that its trunk exudes is so poisonous and acidic that the merest contact with human skin causes a breakout of blisters, and blindness can occur if it touches a person¬¥s eyes. ü§ï Even standing under it in the rain is enough to cause blistering if the skin is wetted by raindrops containing any sap. In addition, a single bite of its small green apple-like fruit causes blistering and severe pain, and can prove fatal. And if one of these deadly trees is burned, the resulting smoke can cause blindness. üòµ This tree isn‚Äôt all bad. Despite the inherent dangers associated, the tree has been used as a source of timber by Caribbean carpenters for centuries. It must be cut and left to dry in the sun to remove the sap. A gum can be produced from the bark which reportedly treats edema, while the dried fruits have been used as a diuretic. It provides excellent natural windbreaks and its roots stabilize the sand, thus helping to prevent beach erosion. üèù . . . . . #moretreesplease #yeseventhisone #trees #tree #appleofdeath #guinness #poison #death #deadly #igtrees #instatree #florida

#yourdailytree is definitely tapping that. üå≤üòã It‚Äôs Maple Syrup season and we can all agree that maple syrup is delicious, but what you might not know are these handy sugar maple survival uses (from Willow Haven Outdoor). Note that maple syrup is made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple or black maple trees. *In late winter/early spring when the sap is running, the sugar maple is an excellent source of drinkable water (sap) that needs no purification. Maple sap is nature‚Äôs version of an energy drink ‚Äì rich in sugar and nutrients. I‚Äôve filled a 1-liter canteen in as few as 15 minutes before. Maples don‚Äôt have fully developed (or any) leaves during this time of year ‚Äì hence the importance of being able to identify in all four seasons. üå∫‚òÄÔ∏èüçÅüå¨ *The seeds inside the little helicopters are edible, just like edamame. I just boil them and lightly salt. They can also be fried or added to stews. Remove the outer helicopter. üöÅ *I almost always use maple branches for wilderness cooking. Whether it‚Äôs a spit roast, a hot dog stick, or utensils, I can always find a maple branch suitable for the task. Maple branches naturally have a lot of forks, which is great for pot holders and other wilderness kitchen uses. I also use the leaves to wrap fish or other small game animals when cooling in an earth oven. üç¢ *Young maple leaves are also edible. Toss them into a salad or boil them down with other spring greens. They get bitter and rough as they mature.ü•óüá®üá¶ . . . . . #moretreesplease #trees #tree #sugarmaple #mapletree #maplesyrup #survivalskills #wilderness #wildernesscooking #outdoorsman #igtrees #treesofig #instadaily

#yourdailytree is almost passed over. üå≤ I‚Äôve walked by this tree almost every day for the past 8 months and not once have I stopped to admire it. I noticed it today because it looked so bleak against the cement house and gray clouds overhead. I‚Äôve been practicing being curious during my daily routine such as walking Ripley to and from the bus stop, which in turn helps me to be present. With my new curious lenses on I noticed things on my route that I hadn‚Äôt bothered thinking about before like this tree. üßê I wondered how the owners chose this tree to compliment their home. I imagined how it looks when it‚Äôs in bloom. I considered all the hidden processes happening as spring approaches. I also thought, as I often do, how under appreciated trees are when they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and how we look to the future anticipating their leaves and bloom (except for hay fever sufferers who probably love them like this! üëÉ). When the tree is in bloom I‚Äôll take another pic and we can compare. üå∫ . . . . . #moretrees #moretreesplease #wintertrees #bleak #curious #bepresent #treesofinstagram #tree #trees #landscaping #tokyo #japan #shibuya #morningwalk #ki #awe

#yourdailytree is smelling the oud. üëÉüå≤ What you see here is oud and it comes from the wood of the endangered Southeast Asian agar (aquilaria) tree. When the wood becomes infected with a particular type of mold, the tree reacts by producing a dark, scented resin, which is often called ‚Äúliquid gold.‚Äù First-grade agarwood is one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world. The current global market for agarwood is estimated to be in the range of US$6 ‚Äì 8 billion and is growing rapidly. There‚Äôs a lot of corruption and money involved in the agarwood business, and subsequently the human cost is also rising. Forest guards increasingly face the threat of being killed or injured by illegal poachers. If you buy products made from agar including incense and perfume, make sure you are getting it from a reputable source. . . . . . #moretreesplease #instagood #instadaily #instatree #dailytree #agarwood #oud #agar #endangeredspecies

#yourdailytree learns about forest stewardship (cuz I want one!!). üå≤üíöüå≤ Families and individuals üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ own the largest portion of America's forests. üá∫üá∏üå≤The Forest Stewardship Program helps them to create a long-term vision and plan for their woodlands, so they will stay healthy, productive, and free from subdivision. üíî The Forest Service knows that unfragmented, working landscapes benefit us all, and we know local expertise best meets the needs of owners. For some, their timber creates a nest egg for retirement, while others hold forests for their beauty. Most owners have multiple motivations and goals they meet with the benefits from working woodlands. The Forest Stewardship Program (FSP) provides assistance to owners of forest land where good stewardship, including agroforestry practices, üå≤üåΩü•ïüçÜüçìüå≤ will enhance and sustain multiple forest resources and contribute to healthy and resilient landscapes. The program also helps create jobs in rural communities by sustaining local markets for forest products and increasing demand for qualified private forestry consultants and state field foresters. üí∞ . . . . . #moretreesplease #instadaily #trees #tree #forests #woodland #woodlands #foreststewardship #steward

#yourdailytree gets a sweater. üå≤üë©üèª‚Äçüé§#yarnbombing is considered by some to be a very aesthetically pleasing addition to public spaces including benches, poles, sculptures and trees. It‚Äôs important to note that the yarn can be harmful to the trees, so please keep the following in mind if you would like to knit your favorite tree a sweater: 1. Use a natural fiber, do not use acrylic yarn, which is a synthetic fiber made of plastic. The yarn isn‚Äôt biodegradable and is incredibly unhealthy for the tree. 2. Yarn absorbs moisture and could harm the tree. Keep an eye on your sweater and remove it if it‚Äôs getting too wet. 3. Be mindful of creatures that call your tree home. Or harmful insects that you‚Äôll attract to your tree. 4. Be mindful of your pattern and make sure it doesn‚Äôt restrict a tree‚Äôs growth or sap production.¬†¬†5. Take your yarnbomb down after it‚Äôs served its time.

#yourdailytree loves black panthers hanging out in trees. üå≤ Our inspiration is from watching the incredible Marvel movie. üé• Did you know: A black panther isn‚Äôt its own species but is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species. Black panthers in Asia and Africa are leopards (Panthera pardus), and those in the Americas are black jaguars (Panthera onca). Black panthers are found in areas with dense vegetation, where light levels are lower.  They aren‚Äôt that common in tropical parts of Africa, but have been found in Ethiopia, the forest of Mount Kenya, the Aberdares and a single sighting was recorded in the equatorial forest of Cameroon.

#yourdailytree ties the knot. üå≤üíöüë∞üèΩ Via Cosmo: Women in Mexico are marrying trees, and no, it‚Äôs not a result of bleak dating prospects in 2018 or because they gave up on human marriages. The women are activists who hold marriage ceremonies to raise awareness about illegal logging, or clearing the land, in San Jacinto Amilpas, Mexico. The event is called ‚ÄúMarry a Tree‚Äù and is meant to honor the environment and protect the Oaxaca state, which is one of the regions in Mexico that are most affected by deforestation. Peruvian actor and environmentalist Richard Torres, who married a tree in Colombia in 2014, led the event.

#yourdailytree fights climate ignorance. üå≤üí° Trump Forest was founded in March 2017 by British climate scientist Dr Dan Price, American PhD candidate Jeff Willis and French-New Zealander Adrien Taylor. If the Trump Forest covers an area of approximately 100,000 square kilometers (37,000 square miles), about the size of the U.S. state of Kentucky, it will offset the additional carbon in the atmosphere if the Clean Power Plan is removed. To do this, it is estimated that WE (you and me) need to plant 10 billion trees. üå≤üëç The backward steps of the Trump Administration will be negated until it sees the light and steps up to its duty of leadership, or a sane and logical government that bases its decisions on scientific advice wins the next election. üë©‚Äçüî¨üÜó To participate, donate to a local tree planting organization or The Eden Reforestation project and send the receipt to Trump Forest who will add your trees to the map.

#yourdailytree is a ponderosa pine turned Cub Scout derby car. üå≤üèé My son and his Dad üë®‚Äçüë¶ are in the process of building a car out of a block of ponderosa pinewood for a Cub Scout derby car race. These races have been held for generations all over the world. üèéüåè When I saw the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù block of wood that my husband bought from Boy Scouts of America, I figured that quite a few have been made for Scouts over the years (23 million to be exact) and wondered where the wood was sourced and what sustainable methods, if any, were used to provide the lumber. Yesterday my son went on a day long forest hike and learned how to be a good conservationist so I cared a lot about where the wood came from and BSA endorsements thereof. The trees apparently come from a sustainable forest (where cut-down trees are replaced by seedlings) in Idaho. The Boy Scouts of America are partnered with the Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI). I looked into SFI which is only in the US and Canada. üá∫üá∏üá®üá¶ ‚ÄúIf a product has the SFI label it means it was sourced from a certified forest and by a company that cares about how forests are managed. Look for the SFI label when you buy stuff for your home: food containers, boxes, napkins paper plates and cups, printer paper, grocery bags, lumber, envelopes, and even maple syrup and much more. ‚Äúüå≤üíöüå≤ ‚ùìSFI & Scout Facts *Philmont Scout Ranch ‚Äì One of BSA‚Äôs four national High Adventure Bases in the U.S; BSA achieved certification of 90,000 acres in New Mexico to the SFI Forest Management Standard in 2008, and has maintained certification ever since.\\ * In 2013, BSA launched its new Sustainability merit badge highlighting Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification within the text. This merit badge was added to the list of required merit badges for Eagle rank. \\ * BSA‚Äôs two magazines, Scouting (for Scout leaders) and Boy‚Äôs Life (for Scouts) both carry the SFI on-product label for the paper these publications are printed on. \\ * All new BSA Merit Badge books also carry the SFI on-product label. \\ . . . . . #moretreesplease #instadaily #ponderosapine #derbycar #pinewoodderby #pinewood #sustainableforestry #sfi #forest #forestry #conservation #maker #cubscouts

#yourdailytree and #mydreamhouse. This is exactly what‚Äôs been in my brain for the past 6 months or so. I want to build an eco-friendly house on a creek or river that is surrounded by trees. Trouble is I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense to do it here in Japan or in B.C. or ? Plan is to run various environmental related experiments on the property amongst other activities. I think it‚Äôs an airbnb so a road trip to Germany may be in order. . . . . #Repost @tinyhousemag with @get_repost „Éª„Éª„Éª House Rheder II Weekend House, Rheder, #Germany by Heike Falkenberg | Photo by Thomas Mayer #BookOfCabins #Prefapedia #interiors #interiordesign #architecture #decoration #interior #home #design #camper #homedecor #decor #prefab #diy #lifestyle #compactliving #fineinteriors #cabin #shed #tinyhomes #tinyhouse #cabinfever #inspiration #tinyhousemovement #treehouse

yourdailytree in the mystic forest of Yaku-sugi üå≤ I have a very long list of places that I have my heart set on experiencing here in Japan and Yakushima is at the top of that list. üìú Yakushima is a southern island in Japan üóæ known for its wildlife and subtropical cedar (sugi) forests. üå≤üå≤It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe island of ancient forest and water‚Äù because of the huge Yaku cedars, which are over 1,000 years old, moss and abundant water system (it‚Äôs the rainiest place in Japan)üåß. One of the many waterfalls, Toroki Falls, is the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea. üåä It is the largest nesting ground for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle in the North Pacific. üê¢ Shiratani Unsui-kyo forest is the backdrop in the anime film ‚ÄúPrincess Mononoke‚Äù by Miyazaki. One of my son‚Äôs favorite films.üë∏üê∫ One of the oldest trees in Japan, J≈çmon Sugi (Jomon Cedar) is found on this island.  It is estimated to be between 2,170 and 7,200 years oldüéÖ(Don‚Äôt they have scientific devices these days to figure out the age of trees?). I‚Äôm keen on learning more about the pollution levels as the island is downwind of heavily polluted areas in China. Yakushima white pine in the forest on the island may have been affected by combustion products from coal burning and automobile exhaust. üò∑ Back to the good stuff, it has onsens and deer ü¶åthat walk right up to you.

#yourdailytree we hope! ü•ë When you live in California üå¥ it‚Äôs easy to take for granted how abundant and delicious the avocados are. We eat a lot of avocados ‚Äî pasta sauce, avocado toast, veggie sammy, milkshake (once and never again) and of course avocado rolls üç± (haven‚Äôt seen them here ‚òπÔ∏è). Now that we live far far away we miss our California grown green buttery fruit. If only Postmates could deliver chips and guac to us from Hugo‚Äôs! The last time I was in LA, avocados were dropping on the roof of my AirBnB all night and raccoons were playing soccer with them. ‚öΩÔ∏èü•ë I wanted to take the whole tree with me back to Tokyo. The avocados here aren‚Äôt bad but they aren‚Äôt great and they are a bit expensive. I don‚Äôt even know where they are grown. Anyway, the reason we are attempting to grow avocado plants is because Ripley is going for a Cub Scout belt loop and I want more plants in the house. üå± Hopefully the leaves aren‚Äôt poisonous to catsüêà because there is no doubt Vincent will take some nibbles. A few fun facts I found as we are attempting to grow them.  Sometimes avocado plants will begin growing fruit after they‚Äôre 3 or 4 years old, others take 15+ years to grow fruit, and some never do. It helps to have several avocado trees growing together to aid with pollination. However, don‚Äôt expect the fruit to be anything like the avocado that yielded your seed. Commercial avocados are grown from grafted branches to control the outcome of the fruit ‚Äì a naturally grown avocado may be very different than its parent! ‚ùìAny tips you can provide to aid us in this journey is appreciated! üôè . . . . . #moretreesplease #avocado #grow #growtrees #avocadolove #avocadoseed #avocadoplant #cubscouts #beltloop #houseplants

#yourdailytree and rice fields. üå≤ üçö Since we moved to Japan üáØüáµ, our rice intake has increased tremendously. When I saw this sign at the park I stopped to pause and really think about how this message written a very long time ago still applies to everyone who buys rice, many who depend on it to live, and the plight of rice farmers. (One of my favorite dishes is natto on rice with ume sprinkles on top - ooshii desu!) Back to rice fields and trees. It should be no surprise that rice fields are under threat from climate change, land degradation, water scarcity, and over-exploitation of natural resources. Combined, they put at risk the security of farmers‚Äô livelihoods and food supply. üëé Enter agroforestry, a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland. üå≥üå≥üë©‚Äçüåæüë®‚Äçüåæüå≥üå≥ Trees in and around rice fields help farmers become more resilient to climate change,  increase biological diversity, regulate hydrological and nutrient cycles, protect the soil and improve their incomes. üíØ Adding trees help spreads the risk. Trees are stronger and more resilient to storms, floods and droughts. They can continue to produce both food and income even immediately after a storm or flood that has destroyed a rice crop. Trees endure long droughts much better than even irrigated rice if the source of irrigation water is depleted. üí™üí° One example of this in practice is in Central India where small hold farmers have planted babul trees (Acacia). The trees provide products including fuel, fencing, furniture, farm implements, gum and seeds. Just 20 babul trees per farm have increased their income by 10%. üí∞ Agroforestry practices may also realize a number of other associated environmental goals, such as: * Odour, dust, and noise reduction üòÑ * Green space and visual aesthetics üå∑ * Enhancement or maintenance of wildlife habitat üê∏ü¶äüêª Note: I pulled most of this information from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. . . . . . #moretreesplease #instadaily #trees #tree #agroforestry #permaculture #climatechange #biodiversity #habitat

#yourdailytree protection. üå≤ We visited Koishikawa Korakoen Garden üå≥ next to the Tokyo Dome in Bunkyo. It is a garden from the Edo period dating back to the 1600s. I was interested in the weeping plum trees but they were in the early stages of bloom üå∏ so it was difficult to get many decent pics. Instead we learned a few techniques to protect trees from frost (shimo) üå¨ snow (yuki) üå® and insects. üêú I added a few other pics from the park which is very kirei. Yuki-tsuri translates to ‚Äòsnow suspenders‚Äô. Trees are given extra support by bamboo poles with ropes attached to limbs. If you scroll back, on Jan.15th I posted a pic of this practice at Tsuruga Castle in Aizu, Fukushima. üèØ Yuki-gakoi or ‚Äòsnow shed‚Äô involves creating a wooden shed for a tree or gathering the vulnerable branches of garden shrubs that might be crushed or broken and the use of straw rope to bind them up into a tight living bundle. This technique is also used on old houses. When the house has a thatched roof, the grass used to protect the house in winter is later used for the roof so that there is no waste.‚ôªÔ∏è Shimo-yoke means ‚Äòfrost protector‚Äô. It seems like the same or very similar method to yuki-gakoi. Braided straw is wrapped around the plants to protect them from the cold. üåæ Komo-maki means ‚Äòstraw mat wrapping.‚Äô Its used to collect insects that climb down the tree to winter in the ground to stay warm. The top is loose and the bottom is tight so they just hang out in the warm wrapping until spring when the komo-maki is removed and disposed of along with the harmful insects. ü¶Çüóë . . . . . #moretreesplease #instadaily #japan #tokyo #kouen #trees #tree

#yourdailytree üåø may be the most magical edible plant I‚Äôve learned about to date. üí´ Moringa oleifera is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Moringa (13 species). I learned about Moringa when by chance we bought some tea üçµ at our favorite farmers market at the UNU. üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ Recently I watched a video about a permaculture designer who grows Moringa on a farm in Florida and he said that the leaves have the highest % of protein by weight (more than eggs too). That‚Äôs a BFD for us plant eaters. üí™ I‚Äôm itching to know if I can grow it here in Tokyo or on my future plot. Here‚Äôs more about Moringa! Common names include: moringa, drumstick tree (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), üçó horseradish tree (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree, or benzoil tree (from the oil which is derived from the seeds). It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as vegetables. It can also be used for water purification and hand washing, üö∞ and is sometimes used in herbal medicine. With its high nutritive values, every part of the tree is suitable for either nutritional or commercial purposes. ü§© The leaves are rich in minerals, vitamins and other essential phytochemicals. Extracts from the leaves are used to treat malnutrition, augment breast milk in lactating mothers. It is used as potential antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial agent. M. oleifera seed, a natural coagulant is extensively used in water treatment. üíØ .üå≤ .üå≥ .üå¥ .üåµ .üå± #moretreesplease #instadaily #trees #tree #moringa #drumstick #benzoil #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #veganpower #vegan #protein

#yourdailytree shaping üå≤üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (also known as pooktre, arborsculpture, tree training, and more) is the practice of training living trees and other woody plants into artistic shapes and useful structures. From Horticulture and Soil Science: Tree shaping has been practiced for at least several hundred years, as demonstrated by the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people people of India. Early 20th century practitioners and artisans included banker John Krubsack, Axel Erlandson with his famous circus trees, üé™üå≥ and landscape engineer Arthur Wiechula. Contemporary designers include "Pooktre" artists Peter Cook and Becky Northey, "arborsculpture" artist Richard Reames, and furniture designer Dr. Christopher Cattle, who grows "grownup furniture". These are incredible examples of patient gardening and artistry.

#yourdailytree with Dame Judi Dench. üå≤ Beloved award winning actress, 82 year old Judi Dench, has a 6 acre property in the most wooded county in Britain, Surrey. She‚Äôs been caring for her trees these past 7 years and for one year was filmed working with scientists to learn more about her tree friends. üîç I want to get ahold of the instrument she used to hear water rushing through an oak tree. üëÇüö∞ (BTW I‚Äôm starting to realize that everything I know comes from the BBC and UK actors. üá¨üáßüí°) Here‚Äôs the description of the BBC film, Judi Dench: My Passion for Trees üé• ‚Äî The film follows Judi's experience through the seasons ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏èüå∏üçÅand her mission to understand the vital role of trees in history and the future. Judi joins some of the best tree scientists and historians to unlock the remarkable secret lives of trees and the stories that they cannot tell. With the latest scientific techniques and equipment at her disposal, she is able to truly understand how trees work, and gain an insight into their secrets. She meets a designer with a special microphone to hear the trees around her pulsing with life in spring, as water rushes up the trunks to the newly-unfurled leaves (piezo?). Plus a scientist with 3D scanning technology reveals her favourite oak in a new light, uncovering an astonishing 260,000 leaves and a vast network of branches measuring over 12km. üò≤ Through the cycle of the four seasons, Judi discovers how trees feel, learns how they communicate and how they fight off invading armies and extreme weather. From NASA satellite imagery üì° , Judi is shown just how effective trees are as carbon capture machines that are fighting to protect our planet. A fungi expert also shows Judi the incredible action going on beneath her feet, revealing an astonishing underground fungal network that looks up to the tips of tree roots, connecting many trees in a forest together. It's an incredible system known as the 'wood wide web'. It's confirmation for Judi that trees aren't just trees, they are a real community that help each other, humans and the planet.üåè‚ù§Ô∏èüå≤ . . . . . #moretreesplease #BBC #JudiDench #trees #tree #science #treescience #woodwideweb #kindredspirit #treelove

I would like to direct your attention to not #yourdailytree üå≤ per se but instead something really cute that lives in trees, the Tree Kangaroo. üêªYou see, I was casually listening to Benedict Cumberbatch on a BBC documentary about the South Pacific Islands üèù when footage of a bear appeared on the screen. The thing is, BC insisted the bear was a kangaroo. It‚Äôs Benedict Cumberbatch on the BBC so I couldn‚Äôt exactly ignore the facts and so I played Sherlock and I dug around. Lo and behold tree kangaroos exist. And apparently kangaroos actually started out living in trees and then ended up on the ground like the ones we are used to seeing boxing around Australia. 14 species of tree-kangaroos had enough of the ground and headed back into the rainforest trees of Queensland, Australia, New Guinea and surrounding islands. They are threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction. Wouldn‚Äôt you feel bad if these adorable critters had no homes??? üò≠ Their natural predator is amethystine pythons üêç which also climb and live in the forest treetops. So there you have it. Doctor Strange is correct, this is in fact a kangaroo, not a bear. üíØ . . . . . #moretreesplease #kangaroo #treekangaroo #macropod #marsupial #funfacts

#yourdailytree üå≤ that I‚Äôm hoping you can identify. I‚Äôm leaning towards Japanese Pine. We were out and about after weeks of being sick and my kid was feeling really tired. üò∑ He spotted this tree and decided to go hangout under it. I was interested in why because we had just spent a bunch of time hanging out among beautiful plum blossoms. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I asked him what attracted him to this particular tree and he said the trunk because of the way it grew sideways. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He called it a ‚Äúbig bonsai tree‚Äù which basically means it‚Äôs a tree. üíö Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size trees. We gave Rips a bonsai growing kit which is just a pot, soil and a seed, I probably could have saved a bunch of yen if I just got some seeds from a pine cone. ü§ó  If you are interested in growing a bonsai tree  then check YT. If you are interested in learning about the benefits of kids hanging out in nature and how to make sure they do more of it, I recommend Children and Nature Network. üëßüèΩüßíüèªüë¶üèºüå≤ . . . . #moretreesplease #pinetree #japanesepine #bonsai #japan #tokyo #trees #childreninnature #naturewillsaveus #tree #treestagram #tree_lovers

#yourdailytree üå≤üå∏ Plum blossoms (ume) are also known as Japanese apricot. Before the Nara period (10-794 AD), hanami (flower-viewing) referred to plum blossoms, not cherry blossoms (sakura). Note! cherry blossoms have split-ended petals, whereas plum blossoms don‚Äôt. Also, several cherry blossoms bloom from a single bud and are attached to the branch by a long stem, while there‚Äôs only one plum blossom per bud. The fruit of the tree is used in juices, as a flavoring for alcohol, as a pickle and in sauces. It is also used in traditional medicine. We tried dried ume snacks and I literally spit it out. ü§Æ IMHO they are good chopped up and sprinkled on gohan (cooked rice). üçöJapanese tradition holds that the ume functions as a protective charm against evil üëπ, so the ume is traditionally planted in the northeast of the garden, the direction from which evil is believed to come. The eating of the pickled fruit for breakfast is also supposed to stave off misfortune. üåã We trained over to Hanegi Park, located in Umegaoka (which means ‚Äúplum blossom hill‚Äù). There are 650 plum trees and we were lucky to see some of them in bloom today. We enjoyed a hot honey plum drink which I highly recommend trying. There‚Äôs a wine version but I had just had hot sake and didn‚Äôt want to get too crazy in the middle of the afternoon. üç∂ü§§ . . . . . #moretreesplease #tokyo #japan #plumblossom #ume #hanami #blossom #flowerviewing #iphonex #pinkflowers #pinkflower

Funny how silly rhymes stick in your head but you never think too much about them. üë∂ Many species of Eucalyptus, though by no means all, are known as gum trees because they exude copious kino from any break in the bark (kino is the name of the plant gum produced by various plants and trees, particularly Eucalyptus, in reaction to mechanical damage, and which can be tapped by incisions made in the trunk or stalk. Its red colour, together with the tendency of some species to ooze large amounts of it from wounds, is the source of the common names "red gum" and "bloodwood".). üíâThere are 700 species of Eucalyptus and most are native to Australia but can be found in other parts of the world. I absolutely love the smell of eucalyptus.üëÉThere are pros and cons to these trees depending on where they are - they can drain swamps which helps reduce malaria, but on the flip side they guzzle water. I‚Äôll post more about this tree in the future. . . Here‚Äôs the lil diddy üéº I‚Äôm referring to: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree Merry, merry king of the bush is he Laugh, Kookaburra! Laugh, Kookaburra! Gay your life must be . . . . . #day23 #instadaily #moretreesplease #gumtree #eucalyptus #kookaburra #kingfisher #australia

Day 22 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ It‚Äôs snowing like a mofo in Tokyo, which is rare, so you are getting snow covered trees at the famous Shibuya Crossing. üå® My bus isn‚Äôt running. The train line is hundreds of people deep. Taxis are sliding around the streets. So, I‚Äôm trudging home in the snow. Maybe I‚Äôll rest in a love hotel for an hour or so. Wish me luck. . . . . #day22 #instadaily #trees #snow #tokyo #gambatte

Day 21 of 365 days of #yourdailytree üå≤Waiting for Sakura (cherry blossoms)!! Sakura is the flower of any of several trees of genus Prunus, particularly the Japanese cherry. üå∏ . Just over a year ago we announced that we were moving to Japan. After reviewing photos of a few different neighborhoods, I decided that I absolutely had to move to Meguro. I saw a photo much like this one (taken by @xseanbonnerx) but with the cherry blossoms in full bloom. I was sold. Thankfully a few friends who knew the area explained that it was a bit far in relation to the Safecast office and all the normal activities that we would be doing. Not to mention the mosquitoes! (Thanks @18628679a). Nothing against living in Meguro, I mean, it has the Parasitological Museum (gross) and the park we went to in #day20. We‚Äôll be back to take photos of this river with the gorgeous üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏. I‚Äôve never actually seen them because I always visited in February so I‚Äôm excited, although I grew up in Vancouver which also has lovely cherry blossoms and much closer to see for west coasters. üá®üá¶üå∏ Stay tuned! I‚Äôll be watching the sakura zensen (cherry blossom front) and taking photos just as soon as my iPhoneX arrives. . . . . . #day21 #instadaily #moretreesplease #cherryblossom #sakura #japanwinter #japan #tokyo #meguro

Day 20 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ Today we went for a little forest bath. The Institute for Nature Study is a sanctuary for plants and animals in the middle of Tokyo. They only allow 300 people in at once to preserve the area and so the park can be enjoyed without bumping into a fellow human. I appreciate that because I get very overwhelmed with the number of people in Tokyo ü§Ø and desperately need to recoup on the weekends as far away from other people as possible. Our favorite tree was the "Fabled Pine." My son and I thought it had the perfect reading branch - a good thickness so you wouldn't have to think about balance too much and and it curved up at the right angle for leaning back on. Apparently this pine has been around since the Edo period in the 1600s so I have got to imagine that someone at some point climbed onto that branch and read a book. üìö Back to shirin-yoku or forest bathing.üå≤üõÄüèª It's winter so many of the trees were bare of leaves, but the birds were having a heck of a time. They were eating bugs in the pond and in the dried up leaves. We saw an egret in the aquatic pond that made us a bit homesick for Glendale Narrows in LA. üå¥ We saw a few air sensors in the park and I'm curious to find out what the readings are. I am in the early planning stages of an experimental outdoor space and want to know what instruments are being used in parks around the city. The Forest Bath helped. I went in feeling a bit crabby and came out feeling a little more light. Of course I can't prove that scientifically. Yet. üë©‚Äçüî¨ Thanks to @xseanbonnerx for taking the photos with his new fancy iPhoneX. ‚ù§Ô∏è P.S.¬†Shinrin-yoku is a term that means "taking in the forest atmosphere" or "forest bathing." It was developed in Japan during the 1980s and has become a cornerstone of preventive health care and healing in Japanese medicine. üáØüáµ . . . . . #day20 #Saturday #instadaily #moretreesplease #forestbathing #shinrinyoku #Tokyo #Japan #NatureStudy #pine #fabledpine #edoperiod #foresttherapy

Day 19 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ It‚Äôs Friday and I‚Äôm in love with arborglyphs. Archaeologists have discovered that carving shapes and symbols into living trees has been practiced by civilizations throughout the world but for obvious reasons don‚Äôt last as long as petroglyphs. From the 1850s to 1960s aspen tree carvings were made by shepherds, many of them Basque and Irish American, throughout the Western United States. Archaeologists have discovered many names and dates, as well as drawings and even entire poems on the tree trunks. The herders occupation would have them alone for months at a time in remote forests, so they had a lot of time to hone their tree carving. The herders cut the tree lightly, using pocket knives or nails, to create the desired design. After about a year, the tree ‚Äúcured,‚Äù and their carvings became visible. Recording is important, because aspens live only about 80 years, then fall to the forest floor and decay. Sometimes the shepherds left messages for each other, such as ‚ÄúNever will I camp here again,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGuess how long I‚Äôve been here,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFor the Last Time Farewell.‚Äù Soldiers in WWI and WWII who were in a war zone recorded as much information as they could, carving things such as girlfriends, wives, times, dates, thoughts and feelings. #day19 #instadaily #moretreesplease #tree #trees #aspen #basque #arborglyph #treegraffiti #shepherd #herder #graffitiart #treeart #landart #ephemeral #archaeology

Day 18 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤üëªüå® I‚Äôve got goose bumps! ‚ÄúSnow Monsters‚Äù or ‚ÄúIce Trees‚Äù are referred to as juhyo in Japanese. The formation of a juhyo requires a combination of strong winds from Siberia, low temperatures and snowfall on Aomori fir trees. Since they develop differently depending on the weather conditions and the shape of each tree, no two juhyo are alike. You can‚Äôt really see in these pics but there are ice crystals on the branches. From Wikipedia, ‚ÄúSoft rime is a white ice deposition that forms when the water droplets in light freezing fog or mist freeze to the outer surfaces of objects, with calm or light wind. The fog freezes usually to the windward side of tree branches, wires, or any other solid objects.‚Äù It can be dangerous boarding or skiing near these trees because you can get caught in a pocket, so be careful! If you wanna take it easy you can head to Miyagi Zao Sumikawa Snow Park, located in western Miyagi Prefecture, and take an ice monster tours from the comfort of a snowcat from mid-December to early March.

Day 17 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≥ Let‚Äôs talk about when social media ruins nature. This is the not so lonely Wanaka Tree in New Zealand. (Photo by @tomarcherphoto). Thanks to a few posts and articles highlighting this (willow?) tree, it now gets around 100 visitors per day. Some of those visitors have broken the branches to get a good selfie with the tree or for the perfect wedding shot. When I started viewing all of the photos of this tree I bookmarked in my head to go visit it when I travel to NZ. I mean, I want to sit at the edge of the beach and lose myself in the serenity. The thing is, it‚Äôs very unlikely that I‚Äôll ever visit the tree in this bucolic solitary setting like the photo promises because there will be many other people there sharing the experience with me. Probably poking me with their selfie stick. So it‚Äôs very likely I‚Äôll be disappointed. The good news is that I can skip the crowds, enjoy this photo from my phone, add some deep quote to it, and still receive some health benefits. ‚Äú...short durations of viewing green pictures may help people to recover from stress,‚Äô‚Äô says Magdalena van den Berg, who led the study at the VU University Medical Center. . . . . . #day17 #instadaily #moretreesplease #thewanakatree #wanakatree #newzealand #tree #trees #health #socialmedia #humansruineverything #phototherapy #greentherapy

Day 16 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ Let‚Äôs drift into the artwork of Japanese artist Nagato Iwasaki. üáØüáµ I grew up in Vancouver where driftwood litters every beach. I doubt a single Vancouverite left their childhood behind without making some sort of art piece out of driftwood. Needless to say, I‚Äôm drawn to wood that‚Äôs been out to sea for a bit. Over the past 25 years, Iwasaki has been crafting these driftwood sculptures he calls ‚Äútorso.‚Äù The sculptures are life-sized at around 180 centimeters tall, or 5 feet 9 inches and made entirely of driftwood the artist collects in various locations in Japan. My 7 year old is studying land art and he just reminded me that land art doesn‚Äôt last forever...which makes me love natural art that much more. . . . #day16 #moretreesplease #instadaily #instadailyphoto #landart #driftwood #driftwoodart #sculpture #japanart

Day 15 of 365 days of #yourdailytree üå≤ The conical rope structures on these trees are called yukitsuri or ‚Äúsnow suspenders.‚Äù They are to protect trees and shrubs from the crushing weight of snow. As many as 800 ropes can be used on a single tree. As with so many things here in Japan, this functional practice dating back to 1600 is also very beautiful. I took this photo at the beautiful Aizu-Wakamatsu (Tsurugajo) Castle in Aizu, Fukushima. #day15 #instadaily #moretreesplease #yukitsuri #japan #aizu #fukushima

Day 14 of 365 days of #yourdailytree Go Climb a Tree üå≤ When I was a kid, I climbed a tree or two. The other day I saw a little kid climbing a tree in order to retrieve his kite that was stuck high up in the branches. I thought to myself, gosh, I wish I was a kid again so I could climb trees. When I think of adults and trees, I usually think of arborists and loggers. Much to my surprise and delight, I discovered the Global Organization of Tree Climbers and Tree Climbers International. Tree climbing for fun isn't just for kids! Both orgs offer guidelines on how to choose trees to climb safely and how not to harm the trees. There are courses you can take if you want some 1:1 time with an instructor. I was ecstatic to find a group in Tokyo. So, if I can get over my fear of heights, one of these days I might post a pic of me high up in a tree. http://treeclimbing.com/ http://www.gotreeclimbing.org/ #day14of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #trees #tree #treeclimbing #climbatree

Day 13 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ Let‚Äôs talk Cedar Oil. I enjoy aromatherapy because it does a great job of masking obnoxious smells. I do sniff peppermint oil to wake up and spray lavender oil at night and feel some benefits, but until recently I thought scientific health benefits were BS. I think it‚Äôs the marketing that sucks and the producers should be pointing at real scientific studies. (BTW the pics are of a Virginian Juniper (Juniperus virginiana) where some of the most expensive cedar oil is extracted from). In 2009 Japanese scientists published a small study that found inhaling tree-derived compounds ‚Äî known as phytoncides ‚Äî from certain types of pine and cypress trees reduced concentrations of stress hormones in men and women and enhanced the activity of white-blood cells known as natural killer cells. Another study found that inhaling cedar wood oils led to a small reduction in blood pressure. Cedarwood oil is used as an antibacterial and fungicide against athletes foot and toenail infections. Cedar leaf oil derived from the Western red cedar was evaluated as a safe and acceptable broad spectrum antimicrobial agent, with a view to its potential applications in buildings, including the alleviation of sick building syndrome. One of the elements found in many cedar trees is cedrol. Depending on the amount of cedrol in a specific species of cedar can determine its pesticidal effect on insects. Cedrol strongly attracts pregnant female mosquitoes after they have fed, which can be used to create cedrol-baited traps. Studies have also been done to use cedrol as a pest control agent against ants and ticks. American oil production utilizes waste wood from trees felled for timber as well as the considerable areas where the junipers grow as invasive "weeds".¬†Note! International (ISO) standards exist for Texas and Virginia cedar oil but not other countries. You can‚Äôt trust the % of pure oil you are getting from other origins.

Day 12 of 365 of #yourdailytree. Mango trees for children in Haiti. üå≥ Like you, I was appalled by the ‚Äúshithole country‚Äù comments made by 45. As a newly minted American I‚Äôm chomping at the bit to vote out his ass and every other GOP member that has stood by him. In the meantime, I will take this opportunity to tell you how mangoes can help children in Haiti go to school. You see, kids in Haiti can‚Äôt go to school unless they pay tuition, and many families can‚Äôt afford it. 50% of the children don‚Äôt attend school and many families live on just $2 per day. There are nonprofits like The Haiti Plunge that raise funds to sponsor children. ‚ÄúThe Giving Tree Project, a Jane Goodall Institute Roots & Shoots campaign, was launched nearly eight years ago by Haiti Plunge. Through the Giving Tree Project, mango trees are distributed to Haitian children ranging in ages from newborn to seven years old. Within 3-4 years, the trees begin to produce fruit, helping to alleviate food insecurity and providing extra income for families. The money from selling the fruit is often used to cover school tuition. Additionally, the planting of trees contributes to reforestation in Haiti and the roots of the trees secure soil, preventing soil erosion.‚Äù Please consider sponsoring a child in Haiti at http://www.thehaitiplunge.org . . . . . #day12 #instadaily #moretreesplease #mango #mangotree #Haiti #givingtree #shitholepresident

Day 11 of 365 days of #yourdailytree - Friendship Tree I had the great pleasure of hanging out with my friend who is in town from Los Angeles. Living abroad in a land where you don't speak the language can be a bit lonely, and even though there is the internet, it's been more difficult than I imagined to to stay in touch with the western world that seems more far away than ever. So when a pal comes through town and makes the time to hangout with me it means the world. Today's tree is in honor of my dear friend Xeni who gifted me with her time, love and hugs, who deeply understands my pursuit of a more analog life and connection with nature and her encouragement to follow my interests, wherever they may lead. The Friendship Tree is a unique citrus tree, in the Friendship Tree Garden Museum and Subtropical Botanical Garden, in Sochi, Russia. The Friendship Tree grew to prominence from the numerous citrus sprigs grafted to it by people of 167 countries from around the world, as symbols of international friendship and living in harmony with nature. The Friendship Tree was planted as a scientific experiment to create a new hybrid of mandarin orange, by FM Zorin in Sochi Agricultural and garden Experiment Station. The tree's experiments became a collection of 45 different types of citrus fruit grafted on it;¬†lemons, tangerines, grape-fruits, etc. #day11of365 #instadaily #friendshiptree #hybridtree #citrusfruit #russia #friendshipgarden #grafting #science #experiment #thursdaythoughts #treestagram #treelovers #tree #trees PHOTOS By Andrey Dumchev - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0

Day 10 of 365 days of #yourdailytree üå≤‚ù§Ô∏è Apparently there are some tree lovers that do a lot more that just hug trees. ¬†Dendrophilia, or arborphilia, literally means ‚Äòlove of trees‚Äô. From Dr. Marcus Griffiths, "This may involve actual sexual contact with trees and/or (as Raymond Corsini notes in his 1999¬†Dictionary of Psychology) veneration as phallic symbols. In his 2009 book¬†Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices,¬†Dr Anil Aggrawal (Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India) defines dendrophilia as arousal from trees or fertility worship of them‚Äù whereas Dr. G.R. Pranzarone in his online¬†Dictionary of Sexology¬†says it is the love of trees. But categorically states¬†‚Äúit is not a paraphilia‚Äù¬†(but doesn‚Äôt give any reason as to why)." // This question was raised in a support group for intense tree lovers.¬†‚ÄúIn my deep, deep contemplations of issues, I am wondering, would it be considered an abusive relationship to use sandpaper or other means to smooth the tree to avoid splinters?‚Äù // A few years ago the 31-year old woman in the photos declared that she fell in love with a poplar tree named Tim and that it was the best sex she‚Äôs ever had, "One night, I took off my top and rubbed my naked breasts against Tim's trunk until I orgasamed." // Happy Hump Day! . . . . . #day10of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #trees #tree #poplartree #Dendrophilia #arborphilia #wednesdaywisdom #humpdayhumor #humpday #treehugger #treehuggers #treelovers #treefetish

Day 9 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. Forestry in a treeless land. Iceland has become a popular destination for many of my friends this past couple of years, some attracted to its alien-like landscape. Forests form a very small part of the Icelandic landscape, only 2%. However, at the time of human settlement almost 1150 years ago, birch forest and woodland covered 25-40% of Iceland's land area. Some scientists thought it was due to the cooling climate, but upon further research, the deforestation is due to those menacing Vikings who chopped down trees for livestock grazing and fodder. By 2100, the hope is for 12% of Iceland to be afforested through both planting and natural forest extension. Interestingly enough, it looks like the warmer weather tied to climate change may be that it's helping to increase the elevation at which trees can grow. From the Icelandic Forest Service (Sk√≥gr√¶ktin): "A century ago, most Icelanders had never even seen a tree and knew that trees could not grow in Iceland. Sixty years ago, few Icelanders believed that trees of any size to speak of could grow in Iceland. Planting trees was the harmless hobby of a few eccentrics, but forests for timber production were out of the question. Today, forestry for timber production, land reclamation, and amenity is being carried out by thousands of people all over Iceland. Growing forests are both an outcome of and cause for optimism. In a treeless land, developing a forest resource is obviously beneficial, a no-brainer as some would say. From a historical perspective, it can be seen as rebuilding a resource that was lost and doing it in a way that meets society's current needs. From an ecological perspective, it is a way of reclaiming biological productivity, preventing soil erosion, enhancing ecosystem resilience and much more. From an economic perspective, it can be a way of meeting certain needs in a sustainable manner.‚Äù Photos CC By-Sa 2.0: Sveinn Joelsson, Doryce, Alaporte #day9of365 #instadaily #moretreesplease #iceland #birch #trees #birchtrees #treeless #afforestation #climatechange #reforestation #vikings

Day 8 of 365 days of #yourdailytree üå≤ In 2013 officials in Melbourne, Australia assigned trees ID numbers and email addresses to make it easier for citizens to report problems like dangerous branches. The unintended but positive consequence was that people did more than just report issues. They also emailed directly to the trees, which have received thousands of messages‚Äîeverything from a quick greeting and questions about current events to love letters and deep thoughts. If you are really lucky, a tree will reply to you. Other cities have created email addresses for trees. IMHO, I think that sending treemails is a much better use of my time than reading tweets from megalomaniacs. #day8of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #loveletters #elm #peppermint #oak #melbourne #citsci #citizenscience

Day 7 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ My second favorite tree is the cacao tree because chocolate. üç´ The cacao tree's botanical name is Theobroma Cacao. "Theobroma" means "food of the gods". There are three common species of Cacao trees: Criollo (Central America), Forastero (West Africa and South America),and Trinitario (all cacao regions). The pods come in various colors depending on genetics and degree of ripeness‚Äîgreen, yellow, orange, red, purple or maroon. They grow directly from the tree's main branches and trunk, not from a stem like an apple does. The pulp inside the fruit contains 20 to 50 seeds or beans. It takes about 400 beans to make one pound of chocolate. //MEDICINAL BENEFITS Chocolate has properties that combat heart disease and¬†lowers cholesterol levels. Cocoa butter is used in medicines mainly in suppositories and ointment base. Note: Cocoa may be a trigger factor for migraine headaches due to the presence of phenolic flavonoids. //DELICIOUS BENEFITS¬†The pulp of the cacao fruit (which surrounds the beans) is edible with a flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon-flavored mango and is used by some to make juices and jellies. //FUN FACTS Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. The pollination process of the flowers of the cacao tree is done by flies, not bees. //ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES¬†NOAA claims that 89.5% of land used to cultivate cacao will not be suitable by 2050.¬†UC Berkeley is trying to use CRISPR technology (a way to edit genomes) to modify the DNA of cacao plants to make them¬†better suited to the rising temperatures. #day7of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #Cacao #Cocoa #Chocolate #theobroma #foodofthegods #cacaotree

Day 6 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ The Weeping Willow is my favorite tree. They are magical, graceful, comforting, protective and perfect for meditating or reading a book under. When I was 5 years old I went to live with my Dad, quite a distance away from my Mom. My favorite tree in our yard was a willow tree. I couldn't hang out near the tree because the ground was too soggy around it. So, I'd sit on a hill near the tree and stare at it, wanting so badly to¬†sit underneath it. And, when I looked at that tree, I would hear a song in my head that my Mom sang to me when I visited her. The lyrics in my head went something like, "where is she, is she underneath the willow tree, that I've been dreaming of..." I actually didn't know until today what the song was until after I did a search for the lyrics. I don't even think I've ever told my Mom how much that song has haunted me. The song my mom used to sing to me is Where is Love? A song from the Tony Award-winning British musical Oliver! and the 1968 film Oliver! based on the novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. Where is love? Does it fall from skies above? Is it underneath the willow tree That I've been dreaming of? Where is she? Who I close my eyes to see? Will I ever know the sweet "hello" That's meant for only me? Who can say where she may hide? Must I travel far and wide? 'Til I am beside the someone who I can mean something to ... Where...? Where is love? Who can say where...she may hide? Must I travel...far and wide? 'Til I am beside...the someone who I can mean...something to... Where? Where is love? ‚ù§Ô∏è //Do you have a favorite tree? Or one that has deep meaning to you?

Day 5 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ If you are into freaky nature or ritual magic then this is the tree for you! Dracaena Cinnabari or Dragon's Blood Tree is only found on the island of Socotra, in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Yemen.¬†The island has been separated from mainland Arabia for 34 million years and 37% of its plant species are found nowhere else. Dracaena is¬†from the greek word ‚Äúdrakainia‚Äù meaning female dragon.¬†üê≤ When you cut into this tree, it bleeds red resin or what the locals call 'emzoloh'.¬†One legend states that¬†Dracaena cinnabari¬†grew from blood on the ground after a great battle between an elephant and a dragon! üêòüêâ //FUN FACT Singapore's Super Tree design was inspired by Dracaena Cinnabari.¬†The man-made mechanical forest consists of 18 supertrees that act as vertical gardens, generating solar power, acting as air venting ducts for nearby conservatories, and collecting rainwater. //MAGIC! Here are a few ways that Dragon's Blood is used in spells and rituals: cleansing¬†and¬†exorcism¬†of a space /¬†empowerment and protection for dream journeys or astral travel / increase courage and protect those going forth to meet danger¬†/ add to a love spell especially if you hope to receive a marriage proposal. / related to the previous? encourage someone who has left to return / draw money and luck and to increase personal power. //MEDICINAL BENEFITS The resin was¬†used and traded by the Roman empire as a medicine as early as the 1st Century BC.¬†It's used as an antiseptic, antiviral, anti-diarrhetic and more. ¬†The antioxidant properties of its extract are used by the cosmetic industry in the production of anti-ageing skin creams. Studies are also being conducted to verify its anti-cancer properties.¬†The resin is also smoked as a narcotic, but the effects are very mild. NOTE!¬†It's important that consumers identify the source of any dragon's blood that they buy because it comes from a few different plants and certain resins may be more dangerous than others.üë®‚Äçüî¨ //PHOTOS CC By-SA 2.0: Rod Waddington, Welcome Images #day5of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #dracaenacinnabari #dragonsbloodtree¬†#dragonsblood #FreakyFriday #magic #spells

Day 4 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ The Douglas-fir isn't a fir tree at all. It's an evergreen conifer native to western North America and has been naturalized in many other parts of the world due to its economic benefits and¬†reputation as a species that may be able to deal with climate change. There are two varieties, the¬†Coast Douglas fir that lives between 500-1000 years and Rocky Mountain Douglas fir that lives up to 400 years.üéÑ //ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS There is general agreement that the Douglas-fir is at the top of the list of trees that give off the most oxygen release. On the flip side, the Douglas-fir is one of the trees¬†especially good at absorbing and storing CO2 (carbon sequestration). üå± //DELICIOUS BENEFITS The buds have been used to flavor¬†eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy.üç∑ //MEDICINAL BENEFITS. Although the USDA likes to refer to these practices as "in the past", look into bioprospecting and biopiracy and you might start to rethink natural remedies. Ethnobotanic: Douglas-fir needles were made into a tea and drank by Isleta Puebloans in New Mexico to cure rheumatism. Douglas-fir resin was used by the Shasta in northern California to poultice cuts and the Yuki along the California coast used a decoction¬†from spring buds to treat venereal diseases. The Sinkyone of California made Douglas-fir bark tea which eased colds and stomach ailments. The Kayenta Navaho of Arizona used the tree to treat stomach disease and headaches.ü§ï //WILDLIFE BENEFITS Douglasfir seeds are used by blue grouse, songbirds, squirrels, rabbits and other small animals. Antelope, deer, elk, mountain goats and mountain sheep eat the twigs and foliage. It provides excellent cover for a wide range of animals. When these trees are cut down,¬†rare wildlife species like northern spotted owls lose valuable habitat.ü¶â //PHOTOS The tree-only photos are at Cathedral Grove on Vancouver Island in B.C. üá®üá¶CC By-2.0: Province of B.C., Sang Trinh, Minette Layne, Tom Brandt, grotto #day4of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #douglasfir #cathedralgrove #pinecones¬†#CO2¬†#carbonsequestration #oxygen #eaudevie #oldgrowthforest #bcforest #climatechange

Enjoying the winter sun and clear blue skies. Feeling a little sad because Vincent didn‚Äôt come home last night and I‚Äôve been sick and cooped up in the house. Sean went to the office so Ripley and I bundled up and checked out a park in Shinjuku with a lovely greenhouse. It cost us a whopping 250 yen to get in. The park has a French garden that we are excited to see in the springtime in hopes it will transport us back to Paris without the long flight. On our way home Ripley was really smiley and I asked him about it, he said it was because he was around all of the lovely plants in the greenhouse and he ran around the trees in the park. I caught myself smiling a lot in the greenhouse too. Nature = happiness. Hopefully when we return home Vincent will be there waiting for us. (Update, he was!)

Day 3 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ Tree Mountain - A Living Time Capsule by artist¬†Agnes Denes. "The tree is made by nature, mathematics by people. And combining the two is creating this beautiful alliance between humanity and nature. That's why my forests are mathematical expansion systems, all of them." - Agnes Denes In 1992, 11,000 people planted 11,000 pine trees on an artificial mountain near Yl√∂j√§rvi, Finland forming a mathematical pattern based on the golden ratio. The golden ratio appears in all forms of nature and science including flower petals, seed heads, pine cones, tree branches, hurricanes...The trees¬†will bear the names of the planters and remain their property through succeeding generations. The trees can change ownership‚Äîpeople can leave their tree to their heirs, or transfer it by other means, even be buried under it‚Äîbut¬†Tree Mountain¬†itself is legally protected for 400 years. Photos and illustrations are from the original planting and recent photos. Shoutout to @xseanbonnerx for the ht!

Day 2 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ A few years back we went on a school camping trip to the Los Padres National Forest in Southern California. Our forest service guide stopped at some pine trees and told us to take a couple of needles off a branch and eat them. She mentioned that each needle had more Vitamin C in them than eating multiple lemons or oranges. üçäüçã She also warned not to eat too many because you will experience a laxative effect. üò≥üí© /// It piqued my interest and I started learning about forest foraging (I‚Äôd love to go around Tokyo if you are into it too!). IMHO pine needles taste better in tea. üçµ There are 126 accepted pine species worldwide and I think it would be a lot of fun to have a pine needle tea-tasting! ‚Äî‚Äî üö´Warning: don't ingest pine needles if you are pregnant and don't confuse them with Yew or Cypress trees. In fact, don't go forest foraging without expertise or an expert. ‚Äî‚Äî Health Benefits: ‚Ä¢Pine needles contain essential oil components such as Œ±-oinene, Œ≤-pinene and camphene, and flavonoids, pinitol and chlorophyll, vitamin A, vitamin C, protein, fat, phosphorous, iron, enzymes and minerals. ‚Ä¢Research has been done to reveal antioxidant activity and a mixture of pine needle, black, and green teas decreased body weight and a fat in overweight human subjects. \\\ Environmental Benefits: ‚Ä¢Scientists have discovered a way to make plastic out of pinene, the fragrant chemical that gives pine trees that Christmas smell. ‚Ä¢Pine needles can accumulate organohalogens from the air, which can then serve as a biomonitor to check levels of organochlorinated contaminants (carbon, chlorine and other elements) in the environment. ‚Ä¢Research is being done on pine needle gasification - to use fallen pine needles as an energy source. ‚Ä¢Unfortunately, due to warming temperatures, there is a Bark (Pine) Beetle epidemic that is destroying forests. Nearly 100 million acres of forests in Western US and Canada have been affected. üêûüëé /// Photos under CC BY-SA 2.0: Plant Image Library, Tara Brown, kensbirds, tattoodjay, Don Graham. #day2of365 #moretreesplease #instadaily #pinetree #pinetrees #pineneedles #pineneedletea #pinecone #foraging

Day 1 of 365 days of #yourdailytree. üå≤ Welcome to my research project on the various mental, physical and environmental benefits of trees. I might misidentify and get some facts wrong, so feel free to gently correct me. üòÉ I‚Äôm doing this in the open because I hope it will increase my speed of learning and to make new tree lover friends. I'll post more information including my projects and references on a site that I'll publish soon. Thanks to @handpaintedbyjanis who inspired me to do this. In honor of the Year of the Earth Dog, our first tree is Cornus Kousa, Japanese Dogwood (Hanamizuki -- hana (flower), mizu (water) ki (tree)). It is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. There are more than 30 varieties of dogwoods including Pacific Dogwood from my home province of B.C. Kousa Dogwood has edible berries that some say tastes between a mango and pumpkin. The berries are used to make wine, and in pies and jams. The tree attracts birds and butterflies. The seeds are eaten by squirrels and birds. Research suggests that the fruit contains calcium and fat similar to avocados. Research has found that the fruit includes antioxidant compounds kaempferol and hyperin and the leaf extract could have pharmacological effects for the treatment of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. You can grow this tree as a bonsai which is known for psychological health benefits.

Happy Year of the Earth Dog! üåèüêï We got up in time to see the first dawn of the year in the land of the rising sun. üáØüáµ Then we walked to the prestigious shinto shrine Meiji Jingu to pray to the deities for good health and fortune. üéç I wish you a very happy new year and I hope that 2018 is a wonderful year for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è Highly perceptive, the Earth Dog is kind, efficient and skilled in communication. As earth produces metal in the zodiac cycle, 2018 is expected to bring prosperity, particularly to those who, like the dog, are proactive, work hard and communicate well. Moreover, experts predict that those who show generosity to others will reap the greatest benefits throughout the year. This is because the notion of fair play and social justice is fundamental to the Year of the Dog. Historically respected in China as a work animal (albeit also as a backup food source) and for showing solidarity in a pack, the dog represents integrity and equality. Zodiac readers are therefore predicting a rise during 2018 in the number of citizens demanding change for themselves and others. Social awareness and action, for the many rather than the few, are expected to be the overarching themes of the year. #HappyNewYear #NewYear #2018 #YearoftheDog #CatismostpopularanimalinJapan

Left is 2017. Right is 2018 and represents how I‚Äôm reframing my thought processes and approaches this upcoming year. My goal is to focus on my own path and not what I think I should do to please others. I hate using popular terminology, but for this once I will because it really is about my truth. I am grateful for everyone this past year that has spent time with me, sent me a message or comment. I wish you a year that brings you hearts and hugs in whatever form brings you joy. xo -ttb

Holiday light displays are called Illuminations in Japan. There are articles written and maps made to explain where all the best ones are. This is the Hello Kitty Illumination at the Shibuya Scramble, shining over the Hachiko statue. We came upon it because we were saying hi to some vegan meetup friends at the animal rights demonstration. We sadly learned that there are no regulations on how animals are treated during animal testing, or being grown for meat or fur. This means that I need to take a closer look at any cosmetics made in Japan. Please get to know where your food comes from and how your clothing and household goods are made. There are fantastic alternatives to leather and fur and down and wonderful animal friendly companies that don‚Äôt test on them.

My Shinola has proven to be a trusty mount through the streets of Shibuya-ku. My local bike shop installed the basket and I purchased the second hand waterproof military-style bag at Tokyo Hands. I‚Äôm not sure how much I‚Äôll want to ride when it‚Äôs super cold here because I‚Äôve become a SoCal wimp. We haven‚Äôt owned a car for 4 months now and life is that much better. It‚Äôs a wonderful feeling to live in a culture where riding is part of everyday life and you walk or take public transit to get around the city or bullet trains to go further out. It reminds me of when I lived in San Francisco the second time before Sean dragged me to LA and I had to buy a car again. lol. Living in Tokyo suits me just fine.

Gorgeous day on Mount Takao for autumn color viewing. I wish my iPhone could capture the colors, but maybe it‚Äôs best it doesn‚Äôt because beauty like this should always be enjoyed with the naked eye. Thankfully we got to the mountain at first chairlift because the line was 100s deep to come up when we were leaving. If you want to avoid queues and a ton of people, always get to popular places before they open. Also, we got something cool for our Robot Flyer Winter Surprise! customers. #kayo #autumnleaves #fallcolors

I keep thinking about this canopy of Ginkgo (Gingko) trees we walked under along with thousands of other people that were there that day. I wonder how many people will pay attention to these trees once the leaves are gone and the branches are bare. From the Smithsonian: In Japanese decorative art, the ginkgo's distinctive fan-shaped leaf has carried symbolism along with its singular beauty: the ginkgo has been a symbol of longevity (the tree can live for a thousand years) and of a more profound endurance (four ginkgos survived the blast at Hiroshima and are still growing today). #ginkgo #gingko #ginkgobiloba #maidenhair #fallcolors #fallcolor #koyo #autumncolors

We know better than to go anywhere on the weekend that‚Äôs a popular tourist spot, but the kid is in school during the week so sometimes you have to suck it up and enjoy spectacular autumn colors with a few thousand people taking selfies. #tokyo #autumncolors #koyo #gingko

Me and the crew enjoyed my birthday concert. Thanks, Rips!

I get asked all the time if I‚Äôm starving in Japan because there isn‚Äôt any vegan food. I want you to all know that it‚Äôs been tough, but I‚Äôm surviving. #vegansofig #veganjapan #veganfoodporn

I married a radioactive monster. Apparently the last Godzilla movie references Safecast a lot. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but that‚Äôs a pretty sweet nod. #godzilla #shingojira #safecast

Scenes from a coffee shop. Just returned from Ripley‚Äôs school where I read a book about Canada to two second grade classes. The kids seemed to enjoy it. The librarian had to translate because some of the kids knew very little English. A couple kids from each class were from Canada - Ontario and Quebec. They were my helpers and very eager to explain what a moose and maple syrup is. Now I‚Äôm at my fave coffee shop working on my #nanowrimo2017 novel waiting for Ripley‚Äôs bus and listening to a Japanese manager tell off an English speaking software developer with a translator. The guy getting reprimanded looks miserable trying to explain to what seems to be a very old school manager what agile is. I thank the universe every day that I am not working for a company (here or abroad) that doesn‚Äôt respect work/life balance and working myself to death which literally happens. Literally!

After being stuck in the house for a week because Rips had CP, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better first outting than tasting sakes from all over Japan. Also I love our new kappa sake cups. @junyamadera the Fukushima sake was a fave!! #sakeflea7 #ilovetokyo

Just say no to borrowing ass oatmeal. We don‚Äôt have a lot of vegan brunch options in Tokyo so we‚Äôve been making breakfast at home a lot more. I‚Äôve actually never cooked so much in my life and I‚Äôm starting to experiment more and have fun with it rather than approaching it like a chore. Ripley devoured his breakfast so that‚Äôs winning for this Mom.üëçOatmeal, Raisins, Cacao sauce, Bananas, Cacao Nibs, Chia seeds. #breakfastofchampions #veganprotein

Does this disturb and anger you as much as learning about a human being raped? (The story and obviously this photo is about chimps but mentions the orangutan so that‚Äôs why this pic doesn‚Äôt line up. Source @nytimes) Y / N
