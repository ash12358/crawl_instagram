“This is opportunity” says Brig. Gen. Monteith, moments before triggering the demo of historic LC17 at CCAFS & @45thSpaceWing, cleared for use by @MoonExpressInc. 325 missions were launched from these pads over 61 yrs; last launch was a DeltaII nearly 7 yrs ago.

Without a doubt, the #SpaceX #CRS15 launch was the prettiest I've seen, and it was one of the best-captured launches (there were so many great shots taken of this launch), so I'm humbled and positively thrilled that my launch streak is NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) ("APOD") for today, July 4, 2018. In a full embrace of the 4th of July, the very apt title for this APOD is "Dawn's Early Light, Rocket's Red Glare." - I extend gratitude to APOD authors and editors Jerry Bonnell and Robert Nemiroff for selecting my photo (and for giving the APOD post such a great title). Also, my thanks to my We Report Space colleagues, and in particular, to Bill and Mary Ellen Jelen whose support (and constant good-humor) was critical for this (and every) launch. (Also, I think it wasn't my turn to be on the roof of the VAB; they were kind enough to let me jump ahead of them in the rotation.) - Many if not all of the rocket images we capture have, in some form, been tried before, and I have the great benefit of having learned from some of the best photographers, anywhere. As it relates to this shot, Mike Deep (@mikedeep88 ) was the first to explain to me the concept of noctilucent clouds, or, the idea that the plume could be lit by the Sun well before it appeared on the horizon. Deep was awarded an APOD in 2015 for his similar capture of the MUOS4 rocket. He kept that streak running well beyond the norm (a full 90-seconds or more longer than my shot of that launch), and I approached this CRS-15 launch with that in mind. Friday morning, Deep reminded me to "let it run," and after 277-seconds, this is what I captured.- Bonus: In the description, Drs. Bonnell and Nemiroff used links to the launch article on NASA Spaceflight.com that features Nathan Barker's streak (and images by Chris Gebhardt and Brady Kenniston) as well as links to both of Mr. @johnkrausphotos ' well-deserved APODs.

The March of the Shadows, or, Night, Day and Then Night Again (working title) I was extremely fortunate to have a very cool vantage point for the #SpaceX #CRS15 #Falcon9 launch early Friday (June 29) morning: 526 feet in the air on the roof of NASA's iconic Vehicle Assembly Building. During the day, the view is just incredible, but at night (or early morning), it is dark on the roof. Floodlights light the rocket on the pad (SLC-40, 4.75 miles away), but everything else is dark. Save for some aviation lights mounted to the building, flashlights we carry with us, and, in this case, a nearly Full Moon behind us, a small group (Craig Bailey captured a great shot of a few of us shooting the spectacle; it's in the Florida Today gallery) waited in the dark  to be amazed and delighted. At 5:42 am the rocket ignited, bathing the Space Coast in light. Although I am aware of how bright this light is, and I know how it (briefly) affects things (see: Chris Gebhardt  and the 15-foot alligator), seeing it from above is fantastic. At the time of launch, a thin layer of haze had begun to settle over the area, and (in addition to being an irritant to everyone shooting at ground-level) it served nicely as a palette onto which the bright light of ignition cast sudden and long shadows. As the rocket climbed toward space, the shadows moved, growing shorter. It was a hypnotizing dance that caught my eye shortly after the rocket cleared the tower (and my initial frame), as I was removing the camera from the tripod to get ready for the epic downrange plume. Although the plume lit by the rising Sun was undoubtedly the signature feature of this launch, watching the light move across and interact with the land below will, for me at least, be a very memorable thing. This tight crop of my streak shot doesn't do the scene justice, but you can make out the haze and some faint (and sadly, not moving) shadows from trees and such. Too Long; Didn't Read: Rockets are bright. (Pic: me / We Report Space)

This was the pad shot I was hoping for: a wide view of the #SpaceX #CRS15 #Falcon9 rocket, with the very bright 98.5% illiminated (and one day post Full) Moon looking down on the scene. What I hadn't counted on was the enormous LOX cloud blanketing the ground. Initially I was a disappointed by the lack of definition in the foreground, but now it's grown on me. For reference, I used a cool, similar shot by Ben Cooper (@launchphoto ); this shot has certainly been done before, and Ben's shot is really great. Also of note, Bill Jelen did an amazing sequence, with the Moon marching toward the pad in 5-minute increments before the launch. And, no, this is not a composite. I realize the Moon looks like it was placed in the frame after the shot, but it really was that bright at the time of launch. (Photo me aka @mseeley20 / @wereportspace ) — at Kennedy Space Center.

This was a very rare occasion where the #sunset color prediction app got it wrong: tonight was rated at the lowest probability of pretty colors (50%). To my eye at least, the app was very wrong. Many showed up to watch the Saturday night color show, seen here over Lake Washington in Melbourne, Florida. Pic: me

A stormy first day of Summer suddenly came to a dramatic close tonight: over the space of three or four minutes, the #sunset exploded, turning a mostly gray sky into a fiery display of red and orange, seen here over Lake Washington (Melbourne, Florida). (Pic: me)

The skies over the Space Coast and Central Florida were quite clear this (Tuesday) morning, and the Moon was generally cooperative in setting at 12:52am, which made it a great morning for Milky Way hunting. I wanted to head further inland to try some new locations, but in the interest of getting at least *some* sleep, I stuck with the nearby Bull Creek Wildlife Management Area and was not disappointed. I had settled on a spot where the road led perfectly in the direction of Mars (low, bright and to the left of center), but a few minutes after I arrived some ground fog moved in, so I went in further to this location for a few quick shots. Despite the fog .25 miles behind me, the air was very clear (normally, the flashlight would be refracted through the humidity) and it was just a lovely scene. For the technical details, this is my first time using Canon's in-camera long-exposure noise reduction feature. I confess that I'm not really sure it helped, especially because I was using a shorter exposure time (10-seconds vs. 25-seconds). But this was shot at ISO5000, 10-seconds and f2.8 with a Canon 5D4 and a Rokinon 12mm full-frame fish-eye lens. Edits were done in Lightroom, Dfine2 (more noise reduction) and then Photoshop (removal of a short airplane streak). (Photo by Michael Seeley)

#Sunset tonight looked pretty much like the end of the world, it was so orange. I was vexed that I wasn't at the lake in time for peak color, but I did make it in time for this neat show. This is a composite of 5 frames captured over the course of 12 minutes. However cool it may look here, it was even better in-person.

We’re in a bit of a lull between rocket launches and it’s been too cloudy for decent views of the Moon, so here is a picture of a crocodile (and two dragonflies). No photographers were harmed during the capture of this image, although I suspect he could probably reach me if he were hungry enough.

I'm of course exaggerating (but only slightly) when I say that I had almost forgotten what the Sun looks like, given how rainy and generally dreary it's been here for the past several days, maybe weeks. But, tonight, the Sun put in a guest appearance in time to paint some clouds at #sunset, seen here over Lake Washington in Melbourne, Florida. (Photo was taken May 22, 2018, by me aka Michael Seeley)

We all practically lost our minds when we saw this: That's a #FalconHeavy side booster, temporarily parked in front of the hangar. We were out there to set up remote cameras to capture the #Bangabandhu1 #Block5 rocket sitting on the pad, but this fleeting moment of cool was such a treat. This rocket is notable because it is carrying a ton of national pride for the country of Bangladesh, and because this is the first "Block5" rocket, the latest variant of the Falcon9 designed with the intent of being reusable 10 or more times with minimal if any maintenance between flights. In a press briefing Thursday afternoon, Elon Musk indicated that the goal is to be able to fly a Falcon9 rocket again within 24-hours of landing. The Block5 is also the rocket that will carry astronauts to the International Space Station. The Thursday launch was scrubbed. The next attempt is set for 4:14 pm (ET) on Friday, May 11, 2018.

Even though the #PinkMoon isn't supposed to be pink, I guess it was sort of a pinkish-orange as it rose tonight. Here it is opposite a fiery sunset, seen from Satellite Beach, Florida (aka Satty Beach).

This month's full moon has also been called the full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon and the Fish Moon." Pic: me

Three lights against the universe, or, 10,000 apologies (working title) With 10,000 apologies to the numerous and incredibly talented Milky Way purists that I'm friends with, this was the scene this (Thursday) morning at 5:22 am. @johnkrausphotos (right), @marcuscote_photo (left) and I (center) met up at Bull Creek Wildlife Management area to photograph the Milky Way. The skies were clear, and we had to wait for the Moon to set. I started with some shots using a prop I brought with me for the foreground (not the telescope; more on that later, in a future post). But, not long after that, a layer of fog settled over us, showing no signs of letting up. So, resigned to the foggy conditions, we resorted to the ultimate in kitschy Milky Way shots: Flashlights. Three of them, one of them (mine) red. I admit to thinking that this shot is too over the top to post, but I managed to catch something streaking through the frame (top right), maybe a shooting star, probably a satellite. And, it was a fun (if not entirely too damp) morning spent with talented colleagues, making pictures. In this image, even with the fog (and the flashlights; Marcus' is laughably bright), the Milky Way is murky but still visible. Do take a look at the fantastic images John Kraus Photos and Marcus Cote Photography captured. In addition to the Milky Way, they stuck around through sunrise and captured some lovely landscape. Details: ISO2500, f2.8 and 25-seconds with a Canon 5D4 and a Rokinon 12mm fish-eye lens.

Found during memory card cleanup, (another) shot looking straight up 525 feet from floor level inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The last time I attempted this shot, I wasn't exactly centered and used Lightroom's "transform" feature to get the lines straight. But, this time I'm pretty close - this is exactly as I shot it. Photo was taken March 1, 2018, on our way down from the roof after the successful launch of the GOES-S satellite. Details: ISO5000, f4, 1/125 sec at 17mm.

"I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier. Not as something to be conquered but to be explored." (Neil deGrasse Tyson, @neildegrassetyson , 2011) All week the Space Coast night skies have been clear and crisp (by Florida standards, at least), and the Moon hasn't been around to interfere with early-morning star gazing. Every morning this week, I've set my alarm for 3:30 am, and finally, this (Thursday) morning, I didn't shut the alarm off and go back to sleep. An hour later, stargazing ensued. Details: ISO2500, 25-secs, f2.8 shot with a Canon 5D4 and a Rokinon 12mm fish-eye lens from the Bull Creek Wildlife Management Area.

There were quite a few cool things to see at Yuri's Night Space Coast / Yuri's Night at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, but perhaps the coolest was catching the International Space Station as it cruised within sight of KSCVC at 9:14 pm (ET). So, astronauts were on stage inside (including the ever-cool Nicole Passonno Stott), and six astronauts were outside, orbiting the planet. Here is the ISS, seen in 20 10-second increments, with the always-cool Rocket Garden in the foreground. It's the thin line streaking from low right to middle left, rising above the Command Module on the massive (and horizontal) Saturn rocket. And, the stars are streaks as well, as the planet rotates just that much over the course #SpotTheStation

Star Wars cosplay last night at Yuri's Night Space Coast and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. I should add that I labor over posing people in group photos, so much so that I avoid group shots. But this group was so gloriously in-character, all I had to do was point the camera. They were great. (Pic: me)

When my alarm went off at 3:30am, I saw the forecast had changed from "clear" to "mostly clear," and when I went outside and saw the clouds over my house, I nearly went back to bed. I didn't, and after a 45-ish minute drive inland, this happened. This shot was late in the series (taken at 4:55am), and it wasn't until I processed the photo that I saw the thin cloud that had passed overhead (it looks like a faint smudge in the middle of the picture). But, I like this photo (smudgy cloud and all) because of the rather bright satellite that is photobombing the image near the top left of the frame. And, a big shoutout the the mega-talented @marcuscote_photo who was also shooting the scene. His shot is just amazing - go check it out. Details: ISO3200, f2.8 and 25-second exposure, shot with a 12mm Rokinon fish-eye on a Canon 5D4.

Although I really like my engine close-up, this image of the #SpaceX #CRS14 #Falcon9 launch might be my favorite. This is a 15-second exposure of the rocket leaving the pad, successfully sending the “flight-proven” #Dragon capsule on its way to the @iss (atop a “flight-proven” 1st stage). The pad camera is pointed toward the West, and some particularly foreboding clouds (as well as the Sun). In the end, the clouds weren’t an issue. The foreground shows an assortment of the sound-activated cameras we use to capture these pad images. Congratulations to Elon and the SpaceX team! (Photo by me / @mseeley20 / @wereportspace)

I spend a ton of time looking at the Moon, and this is, in fact, the first time I've happened to catch an airplane-lunar transit. And what an airplane it is: that's most likely the HC-130 from the 920th Rescue Wing from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and if you look closely, you can see that the loading (and maybe, in this case, unloading) ramp is down/open. I was in the backyard trying to shoot the 89% illuminated waxing gibbous Moon through the trees, and this plane came into view. I didn't have time to switch equipment (I had the right lens but the wrong, full-frame, camera), but it all worked out well enough. (Photo by Michael Seeley / @mseeley20 )

I get to photograph some cool things, and this is top tier cool for me: meet the B-2 Stealth Bomber. The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber [made] a rare and unique appearance at the upcoming Melbourne Air & Space Show on Saturday, March 24, at approximately 1:45 p.m. to help commemorate the fifth anniversary of the event at Orlando Melbourne International Airport. The B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber [flew] a multi-pass profile with a wide sweeping turn allowing spectators in the event site to see the aircraft from multiple angles including a partial head on view. The B-2, also known as the Spirit, is a strategic multi-role bomber designed to penetrate deep into hostile territory undetected. The B-2 features stealth technology making it virtually invisible to enemy radar allowing it to pass by anti-aircraft defenses to deliver its payload and return to base. The B-2 is a tailless flying wing design and carries a crew of two. It is capable of all-altitude missions up to 50,000 feet with a range of more than 6,000 miles on internal fuel and over 10,000 miles with one mid-air refueling. Northrop Grumman (@northropgrumman ) built the B-2. It is the only aircraft that combines stealth technology and long-range strike capabilities with precision guided munitions delivery.

Moon, Venus, and Mercury (L to R). And, a light from a boat. A post by Phil Plait aka @thebadastronomer alerted me to this alignment tonight, and the view over Lake Washington (in Melbourne, Florida) was marvelous (but overrun with mosquitos). This is about 45 minutes after #Sunset, and the Moon was only about 2.4% illuminated, but ISO4000 brought out some faint details in the dark non-illuminated section of the Moon's face. (I believe that's called Earthshine.) (Photo by @mseeley20 / me)

I've labored over appropriate and creative ways to memorialize Stephen Hawking, and have scoured the interwebs for a quote of his (other than the obvious) to serve as inspiration for how we proceed without his towering influence on science and beyond. In the end, I settled on waking up early, finding some dark, clear sky, and I looked up. And, the obvious (and oft-used) quote, well, it just works. Perfectly. “Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious." -Stephen Hawking, 1/8/1942 – 3/14/2018 Photo details: Single exposure taken at 5:20 am on March 16, 2018, on Route 441 in Kenansville, Florida using a Canon 5D4 with a Rokinon 14mm f2.8 lens. Settings were ISO4000, f2.8 and 20-second exposure time. IT WAS COLD OUT, and not just by Florida standards. My car thermometer read 34 degrees, but the benefit was the air was crisp, and thus the Milky Way was quite visible to the naked eye. Initial edits were done in Lightroom, mostly to try and bring out the foreground. I didn't have any available lights with me (other than headlights), so I'm stuck with pushing sliders to get any detail from the road. And, final edits were done in Color Efex (detail extractor). The bright object near the top right of the frame is Jupiter, and running toward the bottom-left corner from there you can see Mars (in the cloud) and nearby is Saturn. And, although I have seen that quote hundreds of times, I don't know where or when Hawking first wrote/said it, but for here, I lifted it from this NYT article: www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/world/europe/stephen-hawking-q...

Three of my favorite subjects: The International Space Station, the Milky Way and, of course, the still-beached sailboat named "Cuki", captured in 2 frames this morning in Melbourne Beach, Florida. Frame 1 is the Milky Way, taken at 5:48:30 am (ISO3200, 25 seconds, f2.8) and then the second frame was at 5:49am (immediately after the first frame, ISO500, 169-seconds, f5.6) is the ISS, streaking over the Space Coast, heading out over the Atlantic Ocean. And, I was using the Rokinon 12mm Fish-eye for this one, mounted on a Canon 5D4 (full-frame) camera. In my first version of the composite, the star trails were cool, but distracting, because only the brightest stars left trails. So, this composite is only the ISS streak from the second frame, merged using the "lighter color" setting in Photoshop. Also, this was all just before the official start of Nautical Twilight, but (as you can see) the color coming up on the horizon is very apparent. #SpotTheStation

I didn't spend much time on this shot in the moments after the #SpaceX #FalconHeavy launch (and landings!), but after revisiting it this morning, I find myself liking it a lot. The three bands in the streak are cool, as is the bend at the top of the frame as it heads out over the Atlantic. This edit adds some contrast (since that seems to be the thing for FH launch images) and in particular, more detail, so the 3-streaks are more discernable. And it's a vertical crop; my first version was still in landscape. Details: ISO100, 25-seconds, and f32 through a 70-200mm lens with a 10-stop ND filter on a Canon 5D4. Edits in Lightroom and Color Efex4 (detail extractor). (photo by @mseeley20 / @wereportspace )

#SBIRS #AtlasV by United Launch Alliance, on 35mm film Because of processing time, I get to post these images from last week of the #SBIRS #AtlasV launch by @ulalaunch for the first time as a #FBF. (That’s a thing, right?) This was my second foray into film after a 20+ year digital-only run, and this time I was using Kodak Ektar 100 shot with the 40-year-old Canon A1 that used to belong to my dad. This image of the mighty AtlasV rocket was taken 2 days before launch on January 17, 2018. The #sunset behind the rocket made for a stunningly beautiful scene. And, as with my last roll of film, processing and high-resolution scanning was done by The Darkroom. I'm quite happy with their service. Of note: the DSLR version of this shot appears in my IG feed so you can compare film vs. digital. (Pic by me aka @mseeley20 and @wereportspace )

On the morning of December 28, 2017, the Falcon Heavy rocket was raised upright for the first time at Launch Complex 39A for a fit test. This shot was taken from the 7th story of the Exploration Tower in Port Canaveral, Florida, approximately 14 miles to the south of the pad. (Photo by Michael Seeley / We Report Space)

#TBT: Two years ago today, a stunning return to flight and the first-ever return to land for SpaceX. This was the first time I had ever shot launch from Jetty Park and it worked out perfectly, although I continue to be obsessively aggravated by the blue squiggly lines in the frame from a guy with a cell phone, recording (and waving the phone around) the whole time.

I’m a bit behind in my posts, but here is my view from the roof of the Vehicle Assembly Building. At 10:36 am on December 15, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the #CRS13 payload atop a "flight-proven" Falcon9 booster. The Dragon capsule (also flight-proven) is bound for the International Space Station and contains scientific experiments and supplies for the astronauts onboard. This launch was the debut of the renovated SLC-40, which has been undergoing repairs following a pad mishap on September 1, 2016. Approximately 9 minutes later, the Falcon9 first stage would successfully land at SpaceX's "LZ1," treating the Space Coast of Florida to two sonic booms as the first stage descended.

SpaceX Falcon9 landing (!) streak This is a composite of 2 20-second exposures of the #CRS13 #Falcon9 first stage returning to LZ1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. I mis-timed the exposure, so I needed a second to capture the landing burn all the way to landing. That’s the reason for the break in the streak (and if you look closely you can see a faint outline of the rocket at the top of the second streak). Also, note the unsteady streak - when I first saw the frame on my camera, I thought I had bumped the tripod. But, later I realized that those are the adjustments the rocket makes as it is descending toward the center of the "X" painted on Landing Zone 1.

Last Monday night, SpaceX had planned for a late night viewing opportunity of the CRS-13 Falcon9 after it went vertical. Given how cold and clear it was last night, I thought a short series of star trails above the rocket would be in order. But, it wasn't to be. The launch was delayed (at least) one day; the rocket remained horizontal, and I drove home without rocket images, and without star trails. So, I made a brief stop near home to shoot 24-ish minutes of trails over the interesting (at least to me) Junk and Company store, located in a former (and very brightly lit) Greek Orthodox church in Melbourne, Florida. I would have liked to shoot for longer, but it was cold, and I was tired. Details: This is a series of 70 x 20-second exposures, shot at f8 and ISO200 on a Canon 5D4 with a Rokinon 14mm lens. Stacking was done in Photoshop (so I could remove trails from a plane that rudely and brightly flew through 5 of the frames).

May I present my final contribution to the #SuperMoon2017 festivities: The @iss and NASA Astronaut Randy "Komrade" Bresnik, Joe Acaba, Mark Vande Hei, Sergey Ryazansky and Paolo Nespoli cruising over the Space Coast of Florida, seen here against the still very Super full Moon of December 3, 2017 at 11:50pm (ET). This photo was taken near the entrance to the @45thspacewing , @kennedyspacecenter , and within sight (albeit a few miles) of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 where we hope to see @spacex launch cargo to the ISS with #CRS13 on Friday (12/8). Joining in the fun this evening was @surfjunkiejustin , @marcuscote_photo and the legendary @johnkrausphotos . We were 4/4 tonight, with all of us getting the shot, no mean feat, as the transit lasted just .58 seconds. This picture is a composite of 17 images extracted from the 4K video recording I took of the transit. The camera (@canonusa 5D4) was set at ISO800, 1/4000sec shutter speed and f6.3, and I was using my new Sigma 150-600mm lens for this one. (Edited to add the following quote/endorsement/analysis from Mr. Kraus: ".58 * 29.97 = 17.38 = 17. Seeley isn’t a fraud!") #SpotTheStation

We were originally going to go to the Cocoa Beach Pier for the rising of the #SuperMoon, but at the last minute decided to stay closer to home and headed toward Satellite Beach / Satty Beach instead. On the way, I commented that we might be able to catch a cruise ship for the foreground. Thank you to Royal Caribbean International and the Captain of the Oasis Of The Seas for the lovely photobomb of the rising Super Moon. I've rarely had a photographic prediction work this well, at least not on such large scale. The pictures don't do the scene justice; it was amazing to see in person. (Photo by me / @mseeley20 )

I guess I should tag this post with *WARNING - SPOILERS*, in case you ever plan on visiting, but I've seen the show nearly a dozen times now, and I'm never bored. Even though I know what to expect, my heart still races and I gasp every single time. Jenn and I accompanied friends Max and Mason (and their parents; foreground of the pictures) to @kennedyspacecenter / Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex's Atlantis exhibit. The show is excellent (the shot of Atlantis approaching the International Space Station = fantastic), but my absolute favorite part is when you hear the words "Atlantis, welcome home!"

Well, it's magical. #atlantis #kennedyspacecenter #kscvc #space #nasa #spaceshuttle #igdaily #igsg #instagram #instagood #instagramhub #webstagram #photography #photographer #photooftheday #bestoftheday #picoftheday #love #beautiful #florida

#GoodMorning to the Space Coast of Florida, and to the @iss and @nasa Astronauts @astrokomrade and Joe Acaba, seen here flying over Melbourne Beach (and the notorious and still-present "Cuki", washed ashore after #HurricaneIrma). The high and bright pass was first visible at 5:35 am and was visible for approximately 5 minutes. I ended the exposure early because a beachcomber wielding a very bright flashlight was approaching, and I didn't want the light to mess with the exposure. (You can see the light reflected off the stern of the sailboat.) Aside from the flashlight, everything worked well for this shot, most notably, the skies we clear and the tide was low enough that I could set up (and stay dry) on the west side of the boat. Specs: 149-second exposure, ISO500 and f5.6 taken with a 14mm lens on a @canonusa 5D4 (full-frame).

I’m a bit late getting this posted; sorry. The Space Coast of Florida was treated to clear skies for the Full Beaver Moon Friday night, and we had a front-row seat to the International Space Station's encounter with aforementioned Full Moon at 4:19 am. This is the second time in 2017 we were able to see a Full Moon ISS Transit here, and both times, the centerline was in Titusville, just a stone's throw from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Shortly after setting and aligning the telescope, I began to realize I had underestimated the effects of the weather, specifically, the temperature. The lens started to fog up immediately, and by the time the transit occurred, the image was this semi-blurry thing (left), made visible by a metric ton of clarity and dehaze adjustments in post-processing. I did bring a second camera and was able to capture a crisper image (right). However, I was only shooting through a 400mm lens, and for that, I shot stills (vs. video with the scope), so the victory here was that I was able actually to get seven frames using the "spray and pray" method of photography. The other thing I learned is that last night's Full Moon was closer to the Earth, and therefore, bigger than the last Full Moon ISS Transit I shot (in September). That last one was just barely fully in the frame, but the Moon last night (or this morning) was too big, even with the .6 focal reducer. I was going to Photoshop the top of the Moon into this frame but decided to leave it as-is. Also, @johnkrausphotos  And @marcuscote_photo were on hand for the late night/early morning fun and they captured great images of the transit.

SpaceX Falcon 9 in Port with some North Star Trails. (Full disclosure: I've taken some liberties with this image, AKA how I deal with missing epic shots of a rocket arriving in port at sunset.) I wasn't able to see the #SpaceX #KoreaSat5A #Falcon9 arrive in port last Thursday (11/2) night because I had a previously scheduled dinner for work. (The Health First Foundation was recognized with a Humanitarian award; it was lovely.) The sunset arrival was beautiful, and well-covered by many excellent photographers (@johnkrausphotos among them), too many to fully mention here. I did manage to make it to Port Canaveral late that evening to see the landed first stage and snapped some images. In the sky, in the general direction of the rocket was, in fact, Polaris, aka The North Star. So, that's what this interpretation represents: one hour of star trails (literally) above the rocket. I say literally because I wasn't getting great long exposures pointed directly at the rocket, so, this is a composite of two frames. The first is with the rocket (ISO2500, f4, 1/6 sec at 70mm) and then the second was taken just above the freight crane (ISO640, f2.8, 4 secs at 70mm). I didn't have time to hang around for an hour (I had a 7:30 am meeting the next day.), so using Photoshop, I "turned" that star field around the North Star 15 degrees, creating fake but generally accurate star trails. And then that became the sky behind the rocket using a tedious layer mask. I'll add that after Googling how to do this, it seems that the fake star trail method is used more often than I realize, and many photographers aren't inclined to disclose their process. Enjoy. #rocket #igdaily #igsg #instagram #instahot #instagood #beautiful #love #nightphotography #night #composite #photoshop #canon #latergram #webstagram #instagramhub #picoftheday #photooftheday #photography #photographer #bestoftheday

I'm sorry, but, I'm not sorry. The Press Site flag + countdown clock + rocket (!) combination is just too good to not turn into a Tiny Earth photo. So, may I present the #KoreaSat5A #SpaceX #Falcon9, in Tiny Earth form. At 3:34 pm on Monday, 10/30/17 @SpaceX successfully launched the KoreaSat5A satellite atop a Falcon9 rocket and, a few moments later, landed the first stage of the Falcon aboard the "Of Course I Still Love You" droneship about 400 miles out in the Atlantic. This is the view from the Kennedy Space Center Press Site, with the countdown clock and the SpaceX webcast visible to the right. #rocket #tinyearth #ksc #rocketlaunch #kennedyspacecenter #florida #igdaily #igsg #instagram #instagramhub #instagood #instagreat #instahot #webstagram #latergram #photography #photographer #canon #love #beautiful

United Launch Alliance successfully launched the #NROL52 satellite atop an #AtlasV rocket at 3:28 am on October 15, 2017, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This was the 5th attempt to launch the rocket, after several scrubs due to weather and one due to a transmitter that was replaced on the rocket. It was a cloudier than we would have preferred; the best streaks were taken off-base, where the clouds were less of an issue. Congratulations to the United Launch Alliance Team and thanks again to the 45th Space Wing for their support and for being such gracious hosts.

I think I can safely speak for the Space Coast when I say that we're tired of the weather, but I shudder to think about the stresses the weather is placing on this #AtlasV rocket, and on the United Launch Alliance team responsible for it (and the #NROL52 payload). The rocket, shown here (with admittedly comic amounts of detail to bring out the clouds), has been sitting on the pad since Tuesday, and ground winds foiled the attempt to launch early this (Thursday) morning. This photo was taken yesterday (Wednesday) morning, during a rainy and very windy remote camera setup, and the standing water in the foreground is an unusual sight. At least in my experience, this area of SLC-41 at 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Fla. is usually (mostly) dry. The next launch attempt is set for tonight (Friday morning) at 4:03 am (ET), although the weather seems to be an ongoing challenge: the current probability of favorable weather is at 30%.

Ghost boat ("Cuki") at night. In the continuing saga of the "Cuki," the 45-foot sailboat washed ashore in Melbourne Beach, Florida, I present this image from Wednesday evening. Unhappily, the boat has become a target for looters. When I arrived, @iangronoskyphotography had chased off a guy and his teenage son who were trying to make off with the canopy, and it seems several things (including the mannequins!!) are missing. Please note that because it is still sea turtle nesting season, lights are prohibited on beaches until after October 31. I planned to shoot in the dark, but Ian called the police to deal with the looters, and the police used big flashlights to check out the scene. And, the top of the mast isn't discolored, but rather it is orange from the cast of the streetlights from the road/parking lot behind me, and the mast is just tall enough to reflect the light that shines over the berm that separates the beach from the road. (Some of the lines are reflecting it as well.) Details: This image is a merge of 78 30-second exposures (ISO3200, f8) to show the movement of the stars, and then I had one frame from when I was setting up and framing the shot that was shot at ISO800 and f5.6 for 54-seconds that captured the officer's flashlight sweeping over the boat. Initial edits were done in Lightroom, and the stacking was done in Photoshop.

Meet the "Cuki," a 45-foot sailboat that washed ashore in Melbourne Beach, Florida sometime Monday night. Fox 35 WOFL is calling it a "ghost boat," a title it surely deserves, as it is entirely devoid of life. It did, however, have mannequins on board. (If you think I'm kidding, simply hop over to Ian Gronosky's / @iangronoskyphotography post to see.) The boat is labeled as coming out of New Rochelle, New York, but according to the Fox35 report, "a representative for the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office said that the boat is registered in Key West and deputies believe it was washed northward by Hurricane Irma and other storms raging through the Atlantic. The Sheriff’s Office has contacted the Coast Guard to track down an owner." Interestingly, a Google search revealed some information about the boat's owner, including an image of the boat from May 2016 (and the mannequins!) posted to a sailing blog titled "Make Like an Ape Man." In the blog, the author describes the boat's owner Jeff and a dog named Cinnamon as having lived on the boat. I don't know what happened to Cinnamon, but, after a little more poking around, it seems that Jeff is (essentially) fine, or at least not drowned, because he's in jail...

I've been admiring some of the really great post-Irma surfing photos in my feed the past couple of days (including some really great drone work) from the many talented photographers in the area (too many to list here, sorry). I'd like to add that although I've been around surf for some time now, I really don't know all that much about riding it. But, thanks to Justin's posts/comments, I've recently learned two things: 1. It's not cool to "blast" a great surf location, and, 2. The word "shorepound", which I'd love to use in a sentence, but until I know what it is, I'll refrain. Anyway, here's my attempt to take a surfing picture, seen from Satellite Beach, Florida, Saturday afternoon. #beach #surfing #florida #satellitebeach #waves #ocean #love #beautiful #igdaily #igsg #instagram #instagramhub #instagood #webstagram #latergram #photography #photographer #photooftheday #canon #sports

Watching, waiting, wondering and 'murica: The Saturday scene from Satellite Beach, Florida as the Space Coast awaits the arrival of Hurricane #Irma. We ventured over to the beach for a few moments earlier and found many curious to see how the ocean was doing. We didn't see anyone surfing, maybe because those who have tried have already been sucked out to sea, or because the hardcore surfers are waiting for things to pick up even more.

I ventured out for my nightly pre-Irma foraging expedition and found things to be fairly calm. Our local Publix was well provisioned, and after topping off our supplies (how could I have forgotten chips and salsa, or, perhaps more importantly, wine?) I explored a bit. This picture was taken from the Eau Gallie Causeway, looking toward the Melbourne Causeway and downtown Melbourne. It's rained off and on today, and we've (as you can see) had some thunder and lightning, all as the Space Coast prepares to meet Irma.

With a hurricane bearing down on Florida, the Space Coast was still able to see the International Space Station and astronauts Paolo Nespoli, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Commander NASA Astronaut Randy "Komrade" Bresnik meet the Full Corn Moon of September 6, 2017, seen here from Titusville, Florida, just across the river from NASA's Kennedy Space Center and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. The transit occurred at 3:39 am (on September 6, 2017), and it lasted for 1.06 seconds. Of note, at least to me: this is just 36 minutes after the Moon was 100% illuminated. In other words, this is probably the fullest Moon I've ever photographed, and it happens to have the ISS passing in front of it. Also, the forecast called for mostly cloudy skies, and in fact, when I woke up (at 2 am), the skies above my house (45 minutes away from the centerline) were completely cloudy. But, the sky above Titusville was clear. And, full of mosquitos. Technical details: This was shot using a Canon 5D4 in 4k video mode at 29.97fps at ISO800 and 1/2500 sec. For optics, I'm using a Celestron 8" telescope with a focal reducer. 34 individual frames (each of the ISS frames and two frames of just the Moon) were extracted, processed in Lightroom, combined using the "darken" mode in Photoshop, and then final adjustments were made (again) in Lightroom. To plan the transit, I used transit-finder.com and calsky.com.

At 2:04 am (ET) on Saturday, August 26, 2017, Orbital ATK successfully launch the ORS-5 satellite from Launch Complex 46 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The satellite was launched atop a Minotaur IV missile/rocket. Many Space Coast residents stayed up late (or got up early) to watch the launch. This was the first time since 1999 that SLC-46 has been used. And, the last time a Minotaur rocket was launched was in September 2011.

This is the #solareclipse as seen from Shaw Air Force Base and the @20fighterwing over F-16s from the epically cool @viperdemoteam. I'm showing two scenes mostly because #instagram doesn't handle vertical shots all that well, so the shot on the left is just the #totality, and the shot on the right is a time lapse showing two hours of the Sun moving through phases of a partial eclipse, with totality in the center. Note that the second photo was taken just as totality was ending, so you can see a bit of the "#diamondring" effect. Big thanks to staff from the Shaw AFB PAO and the Viper Demo team for making this photo shoot happen.

I guess this is an #SPS, or slow post Sunday, as these photos are from this past Friday morning. For the #TDRSM #AtlasV launch, we met at the Press Site at 6 am, and on our way to load the bus that would take the media to our respective viewing locations, we were treated to a fantastic sunrise, complete with my newly learned-about phenomena, anti-crepuscular rays. Legend: Top left: 6:42 am, 12 minutes before sunrise, with crepuscular rays in the sky. Note the Press Site flag, the countdown clock and special guest: the crescent Moon. Top right: 6:48 am, looking over the turn basin. Bottom: This is at 6:52 am, as the sun is about to pop over the horizon, behind me. This photo is looking directly opposite the sunrise, from the parking lot (I stepped off the bus to quickly snap this picture). Visible in the sky are rays, converging at a point on the horizon directly opposite the sunrise. Also, this is a three frame panorama so that I could get the magnificent Vehicle Assembly Building in the frame.

My first field use of the 8" Celestron scope that I intend to use for the eclipse resulted in this: a solar transit of the International Space Station / @iss , seen here from Sebastian, Florida. at 5:10 pm on Thursday, August 3, 2017. I didn't have much time to set get set up, particularly because the rain was coming down in buckets until just about 15 minutes before the transit occurred. But the real thing I learned is quite obvious: I've got too much zoom. Even with a full-frame camera, I can't get the full face of the Sun in the frame. Specs: ISO640, 1/2000 exposure time, shot at 29 fps using a Canon 5D4. 24 frames extracted and combined in Photoshop, with initial edits done in Lightroom.

This is the pool at the Costa d'Este Beach Resort & Spa in Vero Beach, Florida with 18-ish minutes of star trails in the background over the Atlantic Ocean. This is a composite of 54 images: 53 of them were shot at ISO800 and f4 with a 20-second exposure (I would have done more, but the sky was getting cloudy), and then one frame was shot at ISO320 and f22 with a 30-second exposure. The 53 frames were combined in Photoshop to create the trails, and the overexposed foreground was masked out and then all that was combined with the properly exposed single image, creating the finished product you see here.

What's the streak in the middle of this photo? It's the @iss, soaring high over the Space Coast of Florida tonight. I'm facing toward the NW, and the horizon was still bright from the sunset, and compensating for the light, I had to take many 30 second exposures. The image is a composite of 5 of the frames, although, because the breeze picked up and was moving the clouds along, I'm only using the background of one of the frames.

Spot the Station: Negative. Lovely sunrise (and bonus crepuscular rays, aka sunbeams): Affirmative. The sky was too bright, and/or cloudy to capture the International Space Station flying overhead, although it was, at times, visible to the naked eye. Good morning.

#SpotTheStation: I was able to capture the July full Moon (aka "Thunder Moon") rising earlier in the evening, and then 7 hours later, this: an International Space Station transit of the same full Thunder Moon. The transit was visible from Cocoa, Florida (not far from where the components of the ISS launched from). And, it lasted a luxurious 1.05 seconds, slower than the .5 second transits I've been capturing (I assume) because the ISS was a greater distance from the viewing location (400-ish km vs. this one at 630km). On board are astronauts NASA Astronaut Jack “2fish” Fischer, Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA Astronaut Peggy Whitson. I caught it using the 4k video recording on a Canon DSLR (ISO640, 1/1250 and f11), shot through a 400mm lens with a 2x teleconverter. 34 individual frames were extracted, and then I combined them using PhotoShop. Minimal edits were done in Lightroom along the way. For my uber space nerd and physicist friends, the details of the pass are pasted below. I use calsky.com and transit-finder.com to plan these shots and, frankly, I remain continually amazed that such a finely tuned event can be predicted, much less captured in this detail. Transit details (source: transit-finder.com): "Sunday 2017-07-09 02:58:22.00 •  Lunar transit ISS angular size: 43.81″; distance: 630.76 km Angular separation: 2.9′; azimuth: 206.1°; altitude: 37.4° Center line distance: 0.54 km; visibility path width: 5.77 km Transit duration: 1.05 s; transit chord length: 29.4′ R.A.: 19h 17m; Dec: -19° 49′; parallactic angle: -23.6° ISS velocity: 28.1 ′/s (angular); 5.15 km/s (transverse) ISS velocity: -5.31 km/s (radial); 7.40 km/s (total); Direction of motion relative to zenith: 23.2° Moon angular size: 30.0′; 41.1 times larger than the ISS Moon phase: 99.9%; angular separation from Sun: 177.4° Sun altitude: -34.9°; the ISS will be in shadow" #space #iss #igdaily #nasa #spacestation #moon #fullmoon #thundermoon #photography #photooftheday #instagood #instagramhub #latergram #Florida #webstagram #pictureoftheday #pic #igsg

At 3:10pm (ET) on Friday, June 23, 2017, Elon Musk's SpaceX successfully launched the #BulgariaSat1 satellite atop a "flight tested" or previous flown #Falcon9 rocket. Shortly after launch, the first stage of the Falcon9 was again successfully landed, this time on the "Of Course I Still Love You" drone ship, positioned 300 miles off shore in the Atlantic.

At 5:15 am this (Friday, 5/26) morning, a brightly lit International Space Station flew over the Space Coast of Florida. Currently occupied by five astronauts (Commander Peggy Whitson, Jack Fischer, Oleg Novitskiy, Thomas Pesquet and Fyodor Yurchikhin), here is the ISS as it nears the end of the transit visible to Central Florida (looking toward the Southeast). I headed to Osceola County, about 20 miles inland for darker skies, and the reward was quite worth the early morning drive: the Milky Way was quite visible, although some clouds from the Southwest were working to obscure the beautiful view I had. Details: To not have a blurry Milky Way and star trails over the course of the long exposure for the ISS, this is a composite of two photos. The first is a 30-second exposure (ISO3200, f2.8) of the Milky Way and the second is a 156-second exposure (ISO640, f4) to capture the ISS as a streak. I am using a Milky Way frame from approximately 15-minutes before the transit because, at the time of transit, the clouds were beginning to obscure the lower visible regions of the Milky Way, and Astronomical Twilight had started, so the clouds were turning into a problem. And, I was using a Rokinon 12mm fish-eye lens on a full-frame Canon body. For post-processing, first edits were done in Lightroom; the composite was done in Photoshop and then "detail extractor" and "color contrast" filters were applied using Color Efex4. #igdaily #igsg #spaceweather #SpotTheStation #isswave #iss #nasa #photography #photooftoday #latergram #webstagram #instahot #instahub #instagram #instagood #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #florida #canon #astronauts #astrophotography #nightphotography #night #milkyway

So, puppies happened on my way to the office this morning. That's right, puppies. The ever-cool @benzelphotography fosters puppies for the SPCA of Brevard Adoption Center / @spcabrevard and she invited people to a park near our house to take pictures of her current pack. In addition to being super-cute, it was also super easy, all due to the thoughtful work of others who brought props (the puppy-sized red wagon, scarfs, a backdrop, even a bubble machine) and positioned the puppies for the shots. It was a great opportunity to take pictures of subjects I don't typically (if ever) photograph. And, assuming none of the photographers took any of the puppies home (I did not, although if I weren't heading to work, I might well have kept one...), these adorable dogs are looking for homes. If you're interested, contact the Brevard SPCA and tell them Melissa Benzel sent you. #igdaily #igsg #dogs #puppies #puppy #dog #latergram #love #igsg #webstagram #instahub #instagram #instahot #instagood #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #photography #picoftheday #photooftoday

45 minutes of stargazing, and I only saw 3 #Aquarid Meteors this morning, and of course they were all during set-up or in-between exposures. I can hardly complain though, as this was my view. And with a nod to Chris Cook, a very talented Milky Way purist, I didn't bring props and kept it simple. Photo was taken in St. Cloud, Florida at 5:12am, May 7, 2017, one of the last exposures I took, just as astronomical twilight was beginning (and just 20-ish minutes after a rather bright Moon had set). Settings were ISO3200, f2.8 and 25 seconds, with a Canon 5D4 and a Rokinon 12mm fish-eye. Quick post-processing was done in Lightroom (it didn't really need much at all), with some &quot;detail extractor&quot; added using Color Efex #photooftheday #bestoftheday #photography #nightphoto #nightphotography #astrophotography #canon #instagram #instagood #webstagram #igdaily #love #latergram #beautiful #latergram #milkyway #florida

At 7:15 (ET) on Monday, May 1, 2017, #SpaceX successfully launched the classified #NROL76 satellite for the NRO from LC39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Approximately 9 minutes later, the first stage of the #Falcon9 rocket would successfully return, landing at LZ1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

ISS Solar Transit: April 17, 2017 Unfortunately, I'm not able to attend the launch by United Launch Alliance (for Orbital ATK) of the CRS-7 Cygnus capsule (named after the great John Glenn) tomorrow, but at just under 24 hours before the launch, I was able to see where the capsule is headed, from a distance of 452 km. May I present the International Space Station, transiting the face of the Sun, seen from downtown Melbourne (just 5 minutes from my office!) and the Space Coast of Florida at 11:46 am (ET). Thanks again to transit-finder.com for another accurate prediction. The transit began at 11:46:40 and lasted a mere .57 seconds. At the time of transit, the ISS was 452 km away from my viewing location. With another nod to Elliot Severn, this image was created by extracting 17 frames from a 4K video (I may post it later), shot at 29 frames per second with an EF100-400mm lens and a 2x converter. Shooting directly into the sun is serious business, so I was using two ND filters (a 10-stop and a 3-stop), and the camera was set at ISO100, 1/3200 and f16. The images were processed in Lightroom, combined in Photoshop using the "darken" mode and then finished (again) in Lightroom with a modest amount of "detail extraction" applied in Color Efex4 as a final touch. #SpotTheStation #iss #transit #isswave #instagram #instahub #instahot #pictureoftheday #photography #photographer #photooftoday #photooftheday #florida #crs7 #cygnus #webstagram #latergram #love #beautiful #nasa #astronauts #internationalspacestation

My contribution to the International Space Station / Lunar transit visible from the Space Coast tonight serves as a reminder that I really need a more solid tripod for these types of shoots. The station should be in a perfectly straight line as it transited the face of the moon, but because of the stiff ocean breeze (and the fact that I was shooting at 800mm) the image jumps around a fair amount. This was shot from Cocoa Beach, Florida, just south of NASA's Kennedy Space Center / Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. The image is a composite of 19 frames shot at 29 frames per second. I extracted the images showing the ISS, did initial edits in Lightroom, created the composite in Photoshop, and then did final edits (again) in Lightroom, with a touch of "detail extractor" applied in Color Efex 4. I like the timing of this shot, as we near Yuri's Night (with many celebrations already having taken occurred Saturday night) and this is also the last night for Station Commander Robert S. Kimbrough, as he is scheduled to return home on Monday, in fact, as I type this, he is already in the Soyuz (along with Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko) capsule.

New Moon and Fair Skies was the forecast for this morning (3/28/17), so I headed over to the beach to see if I could get a peek at the Milky Way. Not surprisingly, it was rather hazy, generally and also from the sea spray, but the Milky Way was still visible (made more so with generous amounts of "dehaze" applied in Lightroom). That's me, center frame. I brought a flashlight to help me navigate the stairs (I nearly wiped out during my last, unlighted, visit) and it turned into a cool prop, creating an invitation to caption this picture "Any intelligent life out there?". Details: Photo taken at 4:52 am (ET) on March 28, 2017 at ISO3200, 30 secs, f2.8 using a 12mm Rokinon full-frame fisheye. Post-processing was done in Lightroom, Color Efex 4 ("detail extractor" only) and then final edits done (again) in Lightroom.

This woodpecker has managed to burrow several little hidey-holes into the front of the building where my office is located and occasionally it will poke its head out to look around. I had my camera with me today and I snapped this picture. The building stood strong through Hurricane Matthew, but is no match for a woodpecker... Edited to add (with credit to Jen Hurley Scheer for the proper identification) that this is a male red-bellied woodpecker.  #birds #woodpecker #birdsofinstagram #bird #igdaily #igsg #instahub #instagram #instanature #nature #naturephotography #pictureoftheday #photooftheday #bestoftheday #picoftheday #photography #photooftoday #canon #beautiful #melbourne #florida #webstagram #latergram

And we have a successful (and chilly!) launch of the #EchoStar23 satellite atop the #SpaceX #Falcon9 rocket, seen here from Titusville and the A. Max Brewer Bridge. The trajectory took the rocket nearly directly away from me, thus eliminating the typical arc (you can see a bit of it though).

Technically, the Moon isn't full until 10:54 am Sunday, so the rather bright Moon we saw Saturday night is something like 99.1% illuminated. So, I felt I could take some liberties with the images of tonight's not-full Moon. Here it is, seen through a 400mm lens with a 2x teleconverter, 8 frames, stacked with median stack mode in PhotoShop, and then run through Color Efex Pro 4; starting at top left and going clockwise the modes are: detail extractor, ink (blue), solarization and then ink (magenta).

I may revisit this edit, but I probably won’t find the time until later in the week, so I present, as-is, the International Space Station passing nearby the Space Coast of Florida with the Milky Way in the background at approximately 5:18am on Tuesday, February 28, 2017. I say nearby the Space Coast because the closest the ISS came was 1,010 km to the SE of Florida (right of frame), and at the point it was no longer visible (left of frame), it was over 1,500 km to the ENE of Florida. Yes, that’s me in the center of the frame, doing the #ISSWave. The Milky Way is not as clear as I hoped. Fog, mist from a rather active ocean, clouds, and too much light pollution all conspired to impede good visualization. Frankly, I’m surprised any of it can be seen. The image is a composite of 18 consecutive images. I shot an initial image at ISO3200, f2.8 and 25 seconds to capture the Milky Way, and then the ISS transit shots were shot at ISO2500, f2.8 and 15 seconds. In order to not have star trails and a blurry Milky Way, I used the initial image as the background, with the transit shots (and me, waving in the foreground) layered on top of that. Post-processing was done in Lightroom, the composite was created using Photoshop and then final post-processing was done in Lightroom.  #igsg #igdaily #instahub #instagood #instagram #photography #photographer #milkyway #stars #astrophotography #spotthestation #nasa #photooftheday #beautiful #love #beach #latergram #webstagram #canon #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #pictures (Photo by @mseeley20 / Michael Seeley) cc: @yourtake @iss

In one last act of CRS10 gratuitous photographic excess, I present 8 seconds in the landing of the #CRS10 #Falcon9 first stage, launched and landed by #SpaceX on February 19, 2017. This sequence of 45 frames begins just after the Falcon9 first stage emerged from the clouds (top left) and ends when the first stage had safely come to a rest on SpaceX Landing Zone-1 (LZ1) approximately 8 seconds after the rocket was visible. Note the deploying of the landing legs, and how close to the ground the rocket is when they deploy. Pictures were taken from the media section of the NASA Causeway, and I estimate we were just over 4.5 miles from LZ1.

This is the #CRS10 #Falcon9 in the early hours of February 18, 2017, approximately 9 hours before SpaceX plans on launching the Dragon capsule to resupply the International Space Station. The image is a composite of over 400 images taken from 12:42 am to 1:04 am, thus creating the star trails above the pad. The launch would later be aborted because of a technical issue. The next launch opportunity is Sunday, Feb 19 at 9:38 am (ET) Specs: ISO800, 2.5 secs and f3.5. Images processed in Lightroom, and then stacked using StarStax, with finals edits done (again) in Lightroom. #rocket #kennedyspacecenter #igdaily #igsg #instadaily #instagood #instahub #instagramhub #instagram #webstagram #latergram #bestoftheday #beautiful #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #spacex

I don't even know why I took the time to do this, because as we've already established, a penumbral eclipse is no big deal, at least not visually. And because no planes flew in front of the moon for me, well, don't get me started on that. But here is an unnecessarily excessive series of shots of the #FullMoon working its way through a rather ho-hum eclipse of the penumbral variety, taken from 6:43 pm (top left) to 7:51 pm (bottom right). #penumbraleclipse #eclipse #lunareclipse #moon #beautiful #love #picoftheday #photography #photographer #photooftheday #bestpicture #bestoftheday #igdaily #igers #instagood #instagram #instahot #instadaily #latergram #webstagram #florida #melbourne

30 minutes of stars + 163 seconds of rocket: It was an amazing night for a rocket launch. Seen here is the United Launch Alliance (@ulalaunch ) #sbirs Geo3 satellite, launched tonight at 7:42pm (ET) atop an #AtlasV rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station with great support form the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force (@45thspacewing ) I had the streak ready within a few minutes, but this stack of star trails proved to be a bit more time consuming to process. The camera was running for nearly an hour, but a few early clouds and my own carelessness junked up a few of the frames, which of course I didn't notice until I started stacking. So this is the last half of the series, with a 4 mid-series frames removed. Congratulations to the ULA team on their first launch of the year and for completing the first launch of the year from CCAFS. Specs: 56x30-second exposure frames shot at ISO500 and f5.6 (trails) and then the streak is a single, 163-second exposure, all shot through an 11-24mm lens (at 11mm) on a full-frame body. Initial processing done in Lightroom, stacking done in Photoshop, with final edits done in Lightroom.

"Imagine how much nicer this would look with a rocket streak" or "Anti-aircraft system wanted" (alternate title) This is the view from the LC39 Gantry, run by @kennedyspacecenter as a (ticketed) viewing area for certain launches, such as the one scheduled for last night. United Launch Alliance (@ulalaunch) had a comfortable 45 minute window to work with, and they even resolved an issue with a sensor that was misbehaving, but a "fouled range" would prevent the launch of the #SBIRSGEO3 #AtlasV rocket. It was an airplane that flew into protected airspace that caused the hold near the end of the launch window. The next attempt is set for tonight (Friday) and the window opens at 7:42pm. This image is a composite of 6 images taken over the course of the launch window. There were a number of people (500, approximately) at the viewing location, and you can see a few of them, rendered ghostly because of the long exposure times used, in this images.

This is not the sun, rather, it is the full moon of January 12, 2017, seen at 6:48am over Lake Washington, from Melbourne, Florida, 14 minutes after the moon was 100% illuminated, and 27 minutes before sunrise (behind me). It was still rather dark out, but a 3.2 exposure time and high ISO really brought out the color the sunrise was throwing into the sky. Specs: Shot at 35mm, ISO2000, 3.2 second exposure, f22. Post-processing done in Lightroom, and then in Color Efex Pro 4, with final edits done (again) in Lightroom. #photography #photographer #fullmoon #moon #florida #igdaily #instagramhub #instadaily #instagood #instahot #instagreat #photooftheday #picoftheday #love #beautiful #webstagram #latergram #canon #instagram

Two moons: the setting #FullMoon this morning, reflected in the waters of Lake Washington, seen from Melbourne, Florida.

"Color needed" or "Post-apocolypse sunset" (working title) This is the view from the southern-most point of Merritt Island (Florida) looking directly at the sunset, but the clouds would effectively conspire to block all colors. So this is the colorless view in a 15-second exposure, with about 3 filters applied from Color Efex Pro 4. #photography #photographer #instadaily #instagram #instahot #instagreat #instagood #beautiful #love #apocalypse #igdaily #webstagram #latergram #igsg #canon #florida #shore #longexposure #bestoftheday #picoftheday #photooftheday

This is a re-process of a photo I took last night of the "Cirque Italia" tents that appeared in the park down the road from our house. I couldn't settle on an edit that I liked, so here is the shot, run through the Color Efx Pro 4 "detail extractor" filter. Also, although I'm certain it's no mean feat setting up this tent complex, I would like to talk to the crew about how they've completely triggered my framing OCD, as they apparently weren't able to line up the "welcome" arch with the lit "CIRQUE ITALIA" arch so they both could appear perfectly between the two peaks of the tent in a nicely framed line... Cirque Italia in Melbourne, Florida, a few days before showtime. Seen on January 2, 2017 in Wickham Park. #instagram #instagood #instadaily #igdaily #igsg #beautiful #latergram #bestoftheday #canon5dmarkiv #webstagram #picoftheday #nightphotography

An epic performance last night (December 29, 2016) by @theroots and @questlove at the House of Blues Orlando / @hoborlando as part of their 2016/2107 Holiday Tour. The group played for nearly 2 hours, and they did a great tribute to #georgemichael and #Prince.

This is a composite of 30 images showing 15 minutes of star trails and then the rocket streak is a 153 second exposure. It was a lovely launch, congrats to @tory.bruno and the team for a great launch.

Goodbye Aldebaran (for now). This photo shows an #occultation: the waning gibbous #moon seen from Melbourne, Florida, about to pass in front of the bright star #Aldebaran, seen just before the star would be completely obscured at 1:14am on October 19, 2016. This is a composite of two frames shot through a Canon DSLR (crop-sensor) and an EF100-400mm lens (set to 400mm), at ISO800 and f5.6. The first frame was shot at 1/320sec (for Aldebaran) and the second was shot immediately after at 1/800 (to exposure the detail on the surface of the moon). Adjustments were made in Lightroom (including white balance adjustments to bring out the orange in the star) and the frames were masked and combined using Photoshop.

As I was shooting my first test exposure, this giant bolt shot down from the cloud, and I captured it, over-exposed and (frustratingly) out of focus. I got three more frames with less exciting (but properly exposed and focused) sticks, but just 7 minutes after I arrived, rain started coming down in sheets so I split. 4 frame composite, shot September 22, 2016 over the Indian River from Melbourne, Florida.
