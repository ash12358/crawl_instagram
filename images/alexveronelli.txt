Reasons WHY SHOULD YOU USE Aurifil 50wt •	THE STRENGTH One of the main benefit you will perceive by using #Aurifil 50wt, unlike other thread brands, is how strong the thread is whilst being so thin. ‘It is light weight & very strong.’ ‘I love that it's thin and strong. I've never had it so easy quilting. I'm sold on Aurifil 50 wt Cotton Mako Thread’ ‘Love this thread. Strong, low lint, sews like a dream, great for piecing and quilting, and comes in a gazillion colors’ #everystitchcounts #threadmatters #aurifil #cotton #quilt #quilting #fabric  #project #collection #stitching  #threadcollection #strenght #perfection #benefit #50wt #strong #thin #light #weight #verystrong #easyquilting #lowlint #sewslikeadream #greatforpiecing #greatforquilting #gazzillionofcolors #colours #cottonmako

We're loving this sneak peek of a project by #AurifilDesigner @sharonhollanddesigns using #Aurifloss! The project is for @jessicaswift 's Tallinn fabrics blog tour next month featuring her debut fabric collection for @artgalleryfabrics ! "Kantha-style chunky hand stitching is fun with @aurifilthread plus I adore those wooden spools! Aurififloss is a 6-ply floss and for my stitches I separated it into 3-ply strands. Don’t worry about your stitching being straight-it only adds to the beauty of the work and the overall effect the closely stitched rows make it all appear straight " To follow along with Sharon, please visit: https://www.instagram.com/p/BgyeI3Nlc4r/ For details on her Color Story thread collection, please visit http://www.aurifil.com/color-story-2 #everystitchcounts #threadmatters #aurifil #cotton #quilt #quilting #fabric #embroideryfloss #project #debut #colelction #stitching #woodenspools #6-ply #separated #threadcollection #details

Reasons WHY SHOULD YOU USE @aurifilthread 50wt • HIGH YARDAGE Unlike other threads, the Aurifil 50wt has a high yardage of thread per spool, allowing you to carry out your larger projects without running out. You have the possibility to work on more than one piece and not have to change your spool. ‘When I filled a bobbin, it seemed to last forever compared to other threads.’ ‘I purchased a variety of these threads in the large spools and find that I can make several laps to queen size quilts from one spool of thread, including filling multiple bobbins.’ ‘I lost track of how many bobbins I filled and also quilted a queen-sized quilt (and pieced it) with one spool. The thread lasts forever on the bobbin!’ #everystitchcounts #threadmatters #quilt #quilting #sewing #embroidery #cotton #thread #aurifil #spool #yardage #runningout #notchange #filled #bobbin #variety #queensize #multiplebobbins #lastsforever

This piece of art completely took our breath away! It was stitched exclusively with @aurifilthread 40wt by Ercigoj Art Embroidery by Boštjan Vidmar and is based on an original work of art by Adriano Cecioni. The finished piece used 67 different colors of thread and took over 300 hours to complete! It contains over 1.3 million stitches & over 10 miles of thread! "The cotton #Aurifil embroidery threads gave the piece a life of its own, a deep tactile quality and a new layer of meaning, and during the embroidery process the thread color palette was used to its limits in order to achieve a perfect rendering of the hands and clothes of the embroiderers within a classical Italian landscape."

#AurifilArtisan and @island_batik Ambassador Laura Piland of @sliceofpiquilts  created this show-stopper for the #FourSeasonsBlogHop. Laura backed her fabrics with Heat-N-Bone Lite from @thermoweb , cut out a variety of circles with her @olfacreates Rotary Circle Cutter, and expertly arranged them in a snowflake pattern. "I used my free motion foot on my @jukihomesewing  TL-2010Q to stitch just inside the raw edge of each circle. I used 50wt @aurifilthread in Grey 2605, Dark Grey 1246, Medium Blue 2735, and Natural White 2021 for this, as they were the closest colors I had in my thread stash to the fabric colors."

The coordinating @aurifilthread collection is a beautiful and bright display of 50wt threads, both versatile and classic.

A colour is not just a colour but often has a storytelling Wondering where the @aurifilthread colors come from? As the time go by we did find inspiration in the nature, for example: flowers, stones, terrains, Italian coasts and hills. Working close with Italian Fashion Designers in Milano and with the Luxury Italian bed Linens Manufacturers we had been inspired by their fabrics or accessories. But for those I consider the coolest shades, Aurifil’s threads did find inspirations in the Masterpieces of Italian brilliant Painters or from Italian Old Textile Books. Sometimes had been a big challenge starting from a photo or an old piece of fabric to figure out the “recipe” to reproduce that particular colour. The figure of the “Dyer” even in an industrialized production is still a romantic craftsman activity. The Dyer is the person that works in order to develop the colour recipes, often reaching the the result only after several tries and putting a lot of personal knowledge and insight. #aurifil #cotton #thread #everystitchcounts #book #colour #color  #flower #stone #masterpiece #luxury #italian #fabrics #accesories #inspiration #romantic #craftman #challenge #fashion #manufacturers #milano #design #bedlinen

#AurifilArtisan Karen Brandt O'Connor of @ladykquilts created these two beautiful pillows for the AGF Quilt Block Tour Of Makers hosted by @colorgirlquilts ! Karen used @artgalleryfabrics Woodland Fusions + Denim Studio fabrics for the pillows, and then added quilting and decorative stitching using @aurifilthread "I selected a number of different colors that complimented the colors in my pillows; #Aurifil 2460, 1135, 2850, & 1158. Using a variety of decorative stitches on my Janome Skyline S5, paired with straight line stitching on a one inch grid, I quilted up both tops."

Once again #AurifilArtisan Laurie Russman from @neonkittyquilts has created an amazing pet portrait quilt! This sweet kitty, named Burrito, was created using fabrics from Laurie's stash, as well as various weights of @aurifilthread "The more shades of thread you use, the better the effect…ditto different weights. I use a number of spools from the Aurifil thread box I curated for my pet portraits :)…try 40wt for fur in multiple shades of the main fur color, and 12wt for the best whiskers!"

Mathew Boudreaux of @misterdomestic completed this Brimfield Block Pillow using a new EPP pattern by @weatherkim of @brimfieldawakening . Not only is it a stunning finish, it's also another excellent example of the versatility of the threads from Mathew's debut Aurifil thread collection! "Even though I knew I wouldn’t see the back since I was turning it into a pillow, I picked @aurifilthread Ermine 50wt for the bobbin since I looooooove the way it looks on denim... For the topstitch, I used Blue Grey 40wt, another staple thread in the Mister Domestic’s Tool Box. Boy oh boy do I love the magic of this color on Fabric."

I just LOVE this #Railway Quilt by Hilary Jordan of @youngtexanmama. She whipped it up for Project Jelly Roll: National Sew a Jelly Roll Day using a free pattern from @fatquartershop. All she needed was a jelly roll of Just a Speck by @jenkingwell Designs, @modafabrics Bella solids in grey and white, and coordinating @aurifilthreadl 50wt threads. "For my quilting I used a whopping 12 different colors of #Aurifil 50 weight thread. I used so many because I matched the thread color to each of the different fabrics. It required a lot of thread changes but in the end it was totally worth it!"

This absolutely adorable cushion was created by #AurifilArtisan Jemima Flendt of @tiedwitharibbon to celebrate the book, "Pretty Handmades" by Lauren Wright of Molly and Mama! We love the combination of quilting, applique, and even some darling embellishments! "Of course I used my favourite @aurifilthread for not only the machine stitching but also the hand sewing detail. I used 50wt for the Blanket stitching and then 12wt for the hand sewing. My favourite colour to piece with is #2405 Oyster. Although it is tinged Pink - it works so perfectly with lots of colours."

Absolutely stunning quilting by #AurifilArtisan @getagrama of Geta's Quilting Studio! She worked with @aurifilthread 28wt thread on top, and 50wt in the bobbin. "Because the thread is heavier, the color is more visible on the quilt; this weight is great to use when you want to give definition to your quilting."

When we first heard that Christopher Thompson of @the_tattooed_quilter had created a fabric collection for @rileyblakedesigns , we may have done a little happy dance. We've been following Christopher for quite some time and have always been enamored with his impeccable style and his uncanny knack for styling the perfect photo. #BlueCarolina is everything that we hoped it would be... sweet, stylish, and edgy, washed in shades of blue, with pops of pink and yellow and a crisp clean white to round it all out.

Meet #SARIELLA, the beautifully brilliant and vibrant @aurifilthread collection debut by design duo Sarah Christine (of  @sariditty ) & Nicole Young (of @lillyellasworld ) collaboratively known as @sariellastudios .

#AurifilArtisan Sedef Imer  of @downgrapevinelane created this stunning quilt for the Daisy Days Blog Tour! The darling fabrics are by Keera Job from @keera.job Design Studio for @rileyblakedesigns , and the pattern is a brand new design by Sedef called 'Desert Windmills'. "I straight machine quilted this quilt myself using my favourite @aurifilthread 50 wt  in 2410 Pale Pink. This is my go-to thread colour now instead of white, as I like the subtle femininity it adds to projects and it works well with natural linen also."

This is a beautiful applique & hand quilted quilt by Carla Morris of @grannymaudsgirl !

#AurifilDesigner Amy Donahue Friend of @duringquiettime  created this amazing table runner! She used the new Classic Curves Ruler by Sharon Mcconnell of @colorgirlquilts  to cut her curves and @barij ’s Sage fabric collection for @artgalleryfabrics . "I was happy to find the perfect shade of @aurifilthread to quilt with. It’s #5015 in a 50 weight. I decided to start quilting in concentric circles beginning with the 3/4 ring formed by the piecing on one end. Within that circle, I made a grid."

WOW is the first word that comes to mind upon seeing  @misterdomestic 's version of #ElevatedAbstractions by @violetcraft Designs. We love reading about Mathew Boudreaux's process, from color selection all the way through his quilting decisions. "As I often do with quilting decisions, my brain became flooded with all these neato ideas that would look rad. But then the ideas overwhelmed me to a standstill and I couldn’t decide for months. So finally I just moved forward with my standby of narrow horizontal lines using @aurifilthread 50wt Ermine which I know will always look awesome sauce and helps move a project from perpetual WIP to the done column."

I'm loving this darling quilt by Daniela O'Connell of @blockmquilts ! The blocks were made by members of her Quilty Circle of Bees group, and then Daniela added low volume sashing strips to complete the quilt top. Her quilting was done using @aurifilthread 40wt thread. "I quilted in loopy loops with beautiful #Aurifil 40wt in colour '2600 Dove', which always works so well when you have lots of different colours in a quilt."

When quilting and literature collide! Afton Warrick of @quiltingmod used Alice in Wonderland fabrics to create an absolutely amazing quilt. One of our favorite motifs is the paper pieced pink flamingo & improv red roses! To make the quilt extra special, Afton quilted verses from the book using @aurifilthread 12wt thread! "I quilted selected poems from Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass using 12 wt Medium Red #5002 Aurifil thread. As this was a new technique for me, I learned a few helpful strategies. -Adjust the tension and needle size. -Hold onto the top and bobbin threads really well after pulling the bobbin thread up to begin sewing. -When tying off threads, refrain from popping the knot into the batting, and instead pull only the thread tails through before clipping. -A busy backing can hide some less glamorous quilting moments. -Order the large spool, as the small spool of 12 wt runs out before you know it."

Is your biz's name typoproof ? "Aurifil" it is and I so love that! Wondering if is there an award for the most mispelled Brand worldwide, if yes we could apply for it …anyway @aurifilthread name online really rocks, here just a small bunch of crazy queries from Google Analytics that brought woot woot in any case to aurifil.com. This is one of the things that makes me so happy nowadays to have a Brand's name unambiguous online, that does not overlap with things, places or other brands names.

Cheryl Kaminsky Brickey of @meadowmistdestash  created this beautiful quilt for two reasons: an entry into her quilt guild challenge, and a gift for her cousin's baby girl. She made the quilt out of a traditional Ruby Roads quilt block, but set it on point for a fun visual twist! " I used a soft white (2021) @aurifilthread in 50 wt for the quilting so that the stitches would blend into the quilt top."

We're kicking off our Spring #ModaMondays with @quilterpatsloan ! Pat Sloan's latest collection with @modafabrics  is #SundayDrive, a group of incredibly versatile prints and colors all inspired by her memories of Sunday drives. Reds, blues, greens, and neutrals come together to create florals, batiks, and lattice prints. The coordinating @aurifilthread collection shares a title with Pat's motto, Let's Go Sew!

his is a darling wall hanging made by @taunjalynn ! She made this mini using the cherry appliques from the Sweetie Pie Sew Along with Lori Holt of @beelori1 . Her fabrics are Sew Cherry 2 by Lori Holt for @rileyblakedesigns as well as fabrics from her stash, and the pattern is her own "Mini Story Stars" which is a free pattern. We love all the little details including the stems that Taunja stitched with #Aurifloss! "To applique my cherries and leaves, I used Lori’s sew-in interfacing method. Rather than hand-stitching them in place, I decided to do a simple outline machine stitch using @aurifilthread 2340 Cafe au Lait 50 wt. I really like the effect. I then hand embroidered the cherry stems using Aurifloss 2340. Using all six strands gives it a nice chunky look."

I'm absolutely enamored with 'Fall Spectrum' by Jessica Skultety of @quiltyhabit . The quilt is based on a tree in her school's parking lot that turns all of the fall colors at the same time. The brilliant colors are accentuated by Jessica's masterful quilting. "The quilting idea came to me eventually: free motion quilt each color in a different motif. Just like all my other quilts, I quilted this one on my home machine, a @janomeamerica Sewing Machines Memory Craft 6300. @aurifilthread had all the colors I could ever want/need for this colorful quilt, including 5017 (lime green), 2870 (green), 1135 (yellow), 1133 (bright orange), 2277 (coral), 2250 (bright red), and 4225 (purple)."
