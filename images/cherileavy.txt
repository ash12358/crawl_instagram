Heavy heart losing Anthony Bourdain. I feel there was so much more to learn from one of the best storytellers we will ever know in our generation. He had the ability, over a meal, to connect with people from all cultures and took us along with him like we were friends on the journey together. He will be missed and hopefully we will all make it a goal to travel and experience new places and cultures, be more accepting and welcoming to others and eat something weird more often! {from my #musicquoteseries with the talented @kaartist} @guide2athens

I have a girlfriend group (we might even have a secret book club ü§êüìö) that has been on a journey through some incredible historical fiction about World War II. We have been moved to tears by the cruelty and the bravery of these times.  Most that we read have strong female points of view which was all the more inspiring to our group.  We found ourselves researching and refreshing our history knowledge.  Don‚Äôt let that intimidate you as they are beautiful suspenseful stories of conflict and love so all page turners perfect for summer time reads.  We welcome any suggestions from you and here are the ones we recommend ... üìï‚ÄôLilac Girls' by Martha Hall Kelly üìó‚ÄôAll the Light We Can Not See‚Äô by Anthony Doerr üìò‚ÄôThe Nightingale' by Kristin Hannah üìô‚ÄôWe Were the Lucky Ones‚Äô by Georgia Hunter {photo: @danielledhulsey}

My friend @lisaellisdesign is a killer cook and entertainer and she made these üçã sorbet cups last time she came over for dinner. You will love them now that it is warmer and ‚òÄÔ∏èoutside! And even better served with @condorchocolates! üì∑ : @danielledhulsey for @wearebulldawgs ‚ÄúLemon sorbet is such a cool treat on warmer days. Light, zippy, and refreshing, it‚Äôs sure to please any crowd. I like to make lemon ‚Äòcups‚Äô with the rinds ‚Äì fantastic for both presentation, and easy to prepare in advance and have in the freezer. The trick to making great cups is to cut the bottom of the lemon that has nipple side. Cut the peak off so the lemon will sit on a flat surface. Cut the stem top off about 1/3 of the way down the lemon. Use a sharp grapefruit knife to scoop out all of the lemon flesh. Freeze the cups to store for future use, or use right away.‚Äù - @lisaellisdesign INGREDIENTS (makes about 4 cups) ‚Ä¢ 3 cups water ‚Ä¢ 1 cup fresh lemon juice ‚Ä¢ Zest from 2 lemons ‚Ä¢ 1 1/2 cups sugar ‚Ä¢ 1 cup basil leaves (or any fresh herb from your garden, thyme, basil, mint ‚Äì any of these are great options!) PREPARATION In a medium saucepan, heat water and sugar over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture begins to slightly thicken. Remove from heat, add basil leaves and lemon zest. Let steep for 10-15 minutes. Strain out the zest and basil, mix in the lemon juice to the mixture. Place liquid mixture in the fridge to let chill for at least 1 hour. Set up your ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Once the mixture is finished and has set, scoop the lemon sorbet into your frozen lemon cups and serve. #ispytscsummitalums #lemonsorbet #wearebulldawgs

Working on a cool ongoing feature with @dominiquepaye for the thesouthernc.com + Bulldawg Illustrated where I will  be dishing with some of my favorite chefs and foodies to share with you. It will be a ‚ÄòSunday Supper Series‚Äô on TSC with TSC alums and ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs Cooking‚Äô in BI with UGA alums (some are both üòç). Anticipate recipes and glimpses into their ideas about everything from marketing to a trip to the market! I caught up with @peter_dale this week for some ideas on folks to feature and it got me craving the hummus we made together last fall. Here‚Äôs the simple recipe ... 20 oz hummus 1 cup shredded chicken (a rotisserie chicken works great here) 1/4 cup dill pickle, diced 1/4 cup pecan pieces 1/4 cup radish, diced 1 oz your favorite hot sauce pita chips 1. Spread hummus into a large, wide serving dish 2. Top the hummus with chicken, pickle, pecan and radish 3. Spoon hot sauce over the top, use more if you like spice 4. Serve right away with pita chips Photo: @danielledhulsey

I am in an exchange with @laurenbhopkins + @veryverastewart to my left in this pic about some amazing ideas to do a cookbook signing in Athens that will blow Bulldogs away it is so neat and then (@whitneywiselong) + @jhhjc to my right are on a thread about @thesouthernc doing a pop up shop with alums for the holidays. And @libbaleap on the far right is always in my inbox with positive and pragmatic suggestions like her bad*#s idea for lifestyle workshops at the next Summit such as Tabletop with @taraguerard and Crafting with @darcymiller.

#TGIF and Happy Homecoming and let's kick off the weekend with a Bulldog Bourbon Smash created by @waitingonmartha for the Heritage Garden Club of Athens and @wearebulldawgs ... Ingredients 2 oz. @bulleit bourbon whiskey a quarter to half cup of fresh citrus juice club soda to top it off simple syrup, as preferred for sweetness whole basil leaves, to garnish ice Instructions Fill a rocks glass with ice. Add 2 oz. bourbon whiskey.  Add 1/4-1/2 cup of fresh citrus juice. Top off with club soda. Taste it and determine how much simple syrup to add. I prefer it more on the tart side, so I am conservative here with the syrup.  Garnish with fresh basil leaves. You can also muddle some basil into the drink for more flavor if preferred.

This is a great tailgate recipe from @waitingonmartha {featured in this issue of Bulldawg Illustrated - link in profile}. I cut the amounts in half and Vance and I enjoyed it last gameday weekend for our Friday night stay-at-home dinner and then with leftovers made sub sandwiches Sunday while working to get BI to the printer. And mom Sudy got the rest today! ‚ù§Ô∏è One Pan Turkey Meatball Bake with Rustic Dipping Bread ... Ingredients 2 pounds organic ground turkey 1 cup white mushrooms finely chopped 4 cloves of garlic finely diced 1 egg 1/2-1 cup Itallian bread crumbs 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. pepper 1 tsp. garlic salt 2 tablespoons worcestershier sauce 2 containers of fresh sliced mozzarella 2 jars of marinara sauce, your choice of flavor Fresh basil for garnish 1 loaf of crusty bread (sourdough, french, whatever you'd like) Instructions For the meatballs: In a large bowl add the first 9 ingredients and mix until well combined.  You may need to add additional bread crumbs to create the right consistency.  You want the mixture to be wet, but able to hold together. Begin rolling your meatballs and set aside on a pan.  You don't want them to be too big as you want them to easily fit on to your bread; about one inch. For the bake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bring a large cast iron skillet to medium coated with non stick spray to medium high heat.  Add your meatballs and cook until almost done turning the meatballs over to brown on all sides.  Approximately 5-7 minutes. Add marinara to your skillet and layer with mozzarella.  Very carefully transfer to oven and bake until cheese is fully melted.  Approximately 7-10 minutes. Remove, garnish with fresh basil and enjoy! PHOTO: @greyowl_social #ispytscsummitalums
