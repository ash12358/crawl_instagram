Travel essentials from day 1. The bag fits a whole lot more but had to scale it down for the picture. ✈🌏 In about a week, I will begin my journey home. Still several stops ahead with many things to be planned but nevertheless, I will leave Asia soon behind. Before I do, I wanted to share the highlights from my amazing trip. I will be sharing through both my IG (jaramae & jaramaev) and through my FB a variety of photos from each stop since I didn't have a chance in the moment to post them. Hope you enjoy the review on the last few months of travel. #jaratravels #jaratravelsasia #funemployed #travel #reflection #journeyhome

Home improvement shopping date. Stops included IKEA, home depot & Canadian tire. Decided to pick up some much needed lighting for his place. 💡 Floor lamp to replace the Christmas tree. His idea to do gradient colored lighting which turned out cool. Bought some color changing led lights for under his kitchen cabinets. All set up before dinner, cuddle session with the cat, movie and video games. We're a super domesticated couple sometimes but I wouldn't trade my time doing sat errands with anyone/for anything else. #thingsyoudowheninlove

First steps are always the hardest. Longest I've run in a long while based both on distance and time. Bf and I are challenging each other to stay on track like we did during the summer. No more winter hibernation. Time to kick some butt 💪🔩🏃 ....yes I know we're jumping on the fitness bandwagon for this time of the year but there are no resolutions here. Just dedication :)

After a long first day back at work, while fighting a sickness, I managed to get back to working out. Decided to have something really delicious to finish the evening - Nana ice cream 🍌🍦mixed with cinnamon, chocolate protein powder and half a teaspoon of nutella, topped with peanuts. So darn good 👍 Hope you had a great start to your week.

First date night of the year. Baked brie with cherry jam, red walnuts, maraschino cherries. Red wine, baguette slices and cretons on the side. Melted cheese is always a good choice. Video games and a new TV show. Also the last few glows from our tree which will be packed away soon.

Today's breakfast consisted of organic steel cut oats cooked in water and organic unsweetened almond milk. Topped with @justins almond butter, dollop of raw creamed honey, and qi'a mixture which includes chia, raisins, flax and dries apples. Very filling.

My first #transformationtuesday. Left - Aug 2013. Right - May 2014. Ive lost some more weight since then but no way to accurately show it. Been waiting to post this until I was in more positive place. Its been about a year now since I started trying to change health and fitness. After doing some sports/physical activities over the summer last year, I decided to make a more dedicated change for the better. I signed up for the gym in search of better guidance and began working out regularly. If there is anyone to thank it is my trainer, @khanversations who I never properly got to say goodbye to or show true appreciation. This guy pushed me from day one further than I thought my body could. There was no can't, and no won't. No one can make you do anything but proper encouragement goes a long way. People can judge on the value of a trainer but for me this was someone who actively supported me, who held me accountable, and wouldn't let me settle for less than what I could truly do. To that, I am grateful. As with all journeys, sometimes you veer off course. Sometimes the journey is a lot longer than you anticipated. I'm not where I had hoped to be a year into my journey. But I also can't deny from looking at photos like the one above that I'm clearly in a better place. I'm very critical when looking in the mirror, as we all can be sometimes. So I often can only see how far I still have to go, failing to embrace how far I've come. Numbers still swirl in my head all the time, evaluating every day for progress. I'm trying to learn to not let it define whether today was a good day or a bad one. Some days you work out, some days you don't. Some days you eat better than others. I'm trying to learn that my progress (or sometimes perceived lack thereof) doesn't define my overall value. Put in the work, do what you can, make positive changes that last. And more importantly and the thing I struggle the most with.. Love yourself regardless. Only you have to wake up to yourself. Your body does an amazing job of carrying you through your daily life. Appreciate it always 😊 'The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself...' ✌& ❤

Summer days are fading with this cold air creeping in. Reminiscing on the few BBQ moments. I'm not the biggest fan of the summer heat but I do enjoy the long days, the sunshine and the general good-time atmosphere. Moving on to Autumn!

After taking a break from eating most dairy, I've reincorporated some yogurt back into my life. And what's yogurt without lovely toppings. Sliced bananas, protein infused granola, a drizzle of organic maple syrup, bee pollen and a cereal mix that includes dried apples, raisins, flax seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds and nuts. 🍌 I originally sent this photo to my bf who quickly asked...'why are you eating bird food?'

Getting reacquainted with the organic produce section. Loving salads and fruit more and more again. Haven't been eating right for a while once my workouts stopped and certainly while on vacation.

This boy is the reason I've fallen off the Instagram wagon. (Plus a broken phone for a week or two) It's been a while since I've hung out with someone this much so I've lost track a little to include someone new in my life. This is one of our first official pictures together, probably my fav one. That smile is one that I was struggling to put on just a few months ago. Feeling defeated by the scale and life circumstances, I had lost myself. But even under duress, I managed to bring myself slowly back to life and into the company of someone great ❤ That said, while I've kept up ok with my working out (it helps that he motivates and works out with me), my eating is not so good and I have hardcore cravings for all things fatty and sweet. Instagram has always been a source of positive motivation and inspiration and so I've returned to allow for reminders of the journey I'm still on. Here's to getting #backontrack :) #weightlossjourney #motivation #fitness #diet

The only thing worth eating on hot days is ice cream. An overindulgence at an ice cream truck years ago lead me to being turned off by this entirely. But it's worth the treat now and again.

The hardest part of a weight loss journey is the mental struggle. I'm in a rut and while I can acknowledge that I'm clearly smaller in this photo and weight loss has happened, my mind just refuses to see it that way. My fitness life is so clouded with so much negativity and disappointment lately, hence the lack of photos. Its been a circus act between days of starvation and binging, riding out the emotional waves of this struggle. I've never been more hyper aware of my size and my lack of progress and lack of dedication. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...and its just been really hard lately to see it...

This is how I do a post workout meal 😉. Salad with all the fixings, guac & salsa with tortilla chips - all keeping me under my calorie intake. Don't believe the hype.

Baked eggs in toast, melted cheddar cheese, topped with bacon and green onion for color. Breakfast done right. 🍳🍞 As I was still experimenting with my oven for time and temp, the yolks weren't as runny as I would have liked but still uber delicious.

Raisin scone, clotted cream from the UK and wild blueberry jam from France. Seriously no better way to start off a morning.

I only ever ate avocados if it was included in my sushi. Otherwise, it was an acquired taste in my mind. These days I can't get enough of them. I add them to salad, use it as a spread, turn it into guac and still include it in my sushi. Definitely a truly yummy addition to my diet. #jaramaefit #healthy #healthyhabits #avocado #guacamole #fruit #fresh #cleaneats #eatright #eatwell #livewell #goodfood #foodisfuel #yummy #healthyliving #diet #instafit #instahealth #instafood #fitnessfood #fitfood #fitfam #fitspo #goodeats #nourish #nutrition #healthydiet #healthfood

My sister convinced me the other day that I needed an espresso to survive the rest of the day. While I love the smell of coffee, I pretty much never drink it. I took about 3-4 sips and gave up. She bought me a regular coffee after and I downed that with ease. To be fair I had dessert before this and made the bitter flavours really stand out. Ill appreciate this fine food someday. ☕ #jaramae365 #100happydays #coffee #espresso #coffeeshop #cafe #caffeine #drinks #

Today I feel lost. Its an uncomfortable feeling. I haven't been like this in years. Losing your daily routine pushes you to the sidelines, watching things whirl by and trying to find your break to get back in the game. There's supposed to be growth somewhere in this but I haven't gotten there yet. All I can do is approach it the way they tell me in yoga - breath through the discomfort, just breath... #sigh #somuchmoretosay

This week I closed another chapter in my life. I've been blessed with opportunities and I'll pray & hope that new ones come along that surpass my expectations. There are certain moments in life where you know that the next step you take will move the course of your life one way or another. I feel like I'm at one of those moments right now. This is my chance to shine and find purpose and while I have no direction just yet, I know I am destined for something great. It's time to put in the hard work and get on that hustle. Big changes are coming. 😊 #jaramae365 #100happydays #blessed #selfie #selfportrait #happy #hopeful #determined #allsmiles #newbeginnings

I forget the actual name of this but it's a cheese pie that I picked up at #athenspastries. It wasn't really one of my favs compared to the other things they have on the menu but still pretty good. Definitely very flaky/crumbly. #greek #cheese #cheesepie #greekfood #food #instafood #foodporn

Loukoumades - discovered these during one of my first jobs as they'd offer it to us as an incentive if our dept had no errors on our tracking report. Made it once in university myself because I had such a major craving. Recently decided to go get it again from #athenspastries. One of my all time fav desserts even if the super sweetness gives me a sore throat - worth it every time.

Just a little over a year ago I was here. Visiting La Jolla on a day trip from San Diego on our California family trip. Hands down one of the best vacations I've ever taken. We had just finished a having a great lunch on a rooftop restaurant (George's at the cove) with an amazing view. Decided to take a scenic walk back to our car and capture endless photos of beaches and water I need to find my way back here, even for a short while again. I miss this place. 🌊 #jaramae365 #100happydays #california #californiadreaming #sandiego #thecove #lajolla #beach #coastline #ocean #waterview #oceanview #westcoast #america #vacation #familyvacation #slr #georgesatthecove #scenic #landscape #bythewater #memories #illbebacksomeday

I made this also ages ago. I think because I showed it to a friend, I totally forgot to post it up on my account. This is home cooked Hainanese chicken and rice. Made with premixed sauces found at the Asian supermarket. The chicken is glazed with dark soy for the purposes of contrast for the pic. My fam loves this dish, esp the rice and we opt to make it at home to control the sodium and cook it with organic chicken. I'm totally craving this right now! #jaramae365 #100happydays #asiancooking #asian #hainanese #hainanesechicken #chicken #rice #homecooking #organic #latergram #goodfood #foodporn #food #comfortfood #delicious

Made this meal ages ago. Discovered the awesomeness of spaghetti squash during a strict diet back in Jan and adored it. Here is roasted spaghetti squash with (almost) raw tomato sauce and a pan seared piece of salmon rubbed with Italian seasoning. That sauce is one of the absolute best clean eats courtesy of @blogilates. 🍅 I don't make a habit of styling my pics for instagram since I just like to show what's only on the plate or in the bowl but I decided to put slightly more effort.

Might as well continue with this comfort food day dream and reveal one of my guilty pleasures - homemade spam musubi! It has to be homemade cause there's no place I've visited that has yet to serve it. Say what you want about spam but I grew up on this and have a deep love for it. I understand its not in keeping with the natural/wholesome/organic life but its a treat that's rarely enjoyed. I fill mine with cucumber and avocado and add sirracha.

With so much on my mind lately, I've been stress eating a little - which isn't good during weigh-in week but what can you do. Completely craving some comfort Filipino breakfast food.

Yesterdays dinner - beef rib from weekend BBQ. Grilled veggies. Fresh bean sprouts. Corn salsa. Freekeh underneath. Was a super long, tiring and somewhat stressful day. Just glad things are on track to be better. Set up a more structured fitness schedule which goes into effect next week. Also did some evaluations yesterday and set some personal bests for reps/time on pushups and shoulder presses. 💪 There's always a positive to focus on. 👍 #jaramaefit #jaramae365 #100happydays  #dinner #beef #veggies #instafood #instafit #instahealth #beansprouts #eatwell #livewell #exercise #workout #fitness #fitfam #food #delicious #healthyhabits #healthyliving #motivation #training #gym #getfit

Rise and grind, its yoga time! After waking up super early I decided to go for a run. I did one yesterday was disappointed in my time so I decided this morning I'd try a new route and enjoy the change in view, even if it means I'm going slower. Once I got back I realized I wasn't going to sleep so I decided to go to the morning yoga class. It was my first 90 min class and other than a few poses, I made it through. Felt amazing and such a great way to spend a Sunday morning! 🙏 #jaramaefit #jaramae365 #100happydays #strength #stretch #yoga #mokshayoga #moksha #mokshahotyoga #hotyoga #instafit #instahealth #healthyhabits #healthy #healthyliving #exercise #workout #workoutmode #sundaystretch

This was earlier in the week during a solo session at the gym. I decided to run there and back (almost 5km total) and do some lifting which I don't do often with my trainer. I don't often take photos of myself esp if I'm not dressed up. I don't have a starting photo and even if I did, I think I'd be too chicken to post it. But this is where I am right now. A lot less...lumpy lol but still lots more progress to come. Can't wait to carve out better curves. Skinny is not the aim, but rather a side effect of strength and endurance training. Stronger and faster is all I seek. Its a struggle battling with the scale and it often discourages me. But I know I am making progress. It always boosts my morale when fit people in the gym come up to me and/or my trainer completely impressed with how high I jump, how much I lift, how fast I go and how long I can endure. Every day is a chance to do better and I just gotta keep reminding myself of that. #jaramaefit #jaramae365 #100happydays #exercise #fitness #fitfam #instafit #instahealth #workoutmode #workout #progress #tranformation #gym #weightloss #weightlifting #cardio #strong #strength #training #fit #health #wellness #trainlikeabeast #fitnotskinny #getfit

This is my yoga mat/yoga towel collection (along with a foam roller to ease my muscles). I am close to finishing my 3rd month of consecutive moksha hot yoga practice. I go at least once a week but aim somewhere between 2-3 times ideally. My fav teacher is not around anymore hence the dip in my attendance lately but I am still making an effort to continue my practice. I hope that in the coming months with the new changes in my life, I'll be able to incorporate a daily practice into my life. Most notably, yoga has helped to keep away a persistent sore throat/sickness that wants to develop as well as keeping my anxiety at bay. I often joke that heading to yoga is heading to therapy for me and there's definite truth to that. Yoga can be very transformative and healing, if that's something you're open to/in need of in your life. Honor your body, honor your self.

While my family had that for lunch (pasta with cheese, salad and wine), I went to the gym for almost 2 hours to avoid temptation. Don't dare tell me that I'm not on that grind.

Happy Victoria day! After a good morning spent sleeping in, I decided to wake up with some hot tea. My room is freezing and I definitely need every bit of warmth. Blend of Blueberry Bliss and Pineapple Kona Pop from @davidstea. No sugar added. 🍵 Tea and paperwork. Sounds like the start of a Monday, even if it is a holiday. #jaramae365 #100happydays #davidstea #tea #teacup #blueberrybliss #pineapplekonapop #steepedtea #mondaymornings #livewell #eatwell #liveclean #simple #wellness #nourish

Spanakopita (spinach pie), Kreatopita (meat pie) & Tiropita (cheese pie) - goodies from #athenspastries /Vic park location. This was my first time trying meat and cheese pie.

Happy mothers day!! Particularly to my wonderful mother. There are so many challenges to raising two daughters who admittedly are pretty crazy and she does it all with beauty, grace, love and guidance from God. I am so blessed to have such a strong willed mother who pushes me (whether I want to or not sometimes) to be better and want more from myself and life. She is the rock to our family, her laugh is the music to our lives and her voice guides us in all everything we do. I love you so much! P.s. a happy mothers day to all the other beautiful women and mothers who play a part in my life. My grandmothers, my aunts, my family friends, my godmothers... And many more. Some say it takes a village to raise a child and I was no exception. For all the love you have shown me, I am eternally grateful. 😘💜🌹

Beast brunch! 🍳🍴☕ Looking at this, I'm already missing brunch goodies. Made the trek out a few weeks ago to have brunch here with the sis. As tempting as the beastwich looked, I knew I couldn't handle all of it and we had a long day ahead so I didn't want to hold on to leftovers or get itis first thing in the morning (wasting food is a crime! 😝) so I opted for the breakfast sandwich - pork belly, fried egg on an apple fritter and my sis got the French toast with duck confit. Of course had to have some of the sauces on the side. Everything was so yummy. Esp the potatoes on the side. Was really tempted to get the doughnuts too but saved it for next time. Can't wait to go back again! @scottvivian #jaramae365 #beast #toronto #food #torontofood #torontoeats #yyz #brunch #breakfast #frenchtoast #duckconfit #hotsauce #sandwich #applefritter #porkbelly #delicious #soyum #latergram

Another one of my summer goals is to spend more time grounding/earthing - time spent with direct contact of my skin to the earth. If you want to learn more about it there's lots of info on the web. Now I don't think that this is a cure for anything but I do believe in the idea of energy - energy of a room, energy of the earth - and that time spent in nature can only do good instead of harm. It allows your body to return to neutral, absorbing earth's energy and reducing the energy you've obtained from being in contact with so many charged items. It is a moment in time where you remove yourself from the tech world and feel your presence on earth. I spend all day at work in front of a computer and constantly attached to my cell phone - that's no path to wellness. Sitting in the afternoon sun, hands and feet touching the ground, feeling the wind and just meditating brings you peace and awareness that is hard to find elsewhere. So take even 10 mins of your day and be outside, feel the ground and remind yourself of what's naturally around you. P.S. I do this on my front lawn cause its convenient and clean. #jaramae365 #100happydays #grounding #earthing #meditate #reflect #relax #wellness #awareness #motivation #nature #health #outdoors #jaramaefit #latergram

Yummy steel cut oats! Topped with raw almonds, cashew butter, chia seeds, granola with a few chocolate chunks and sautéed bananas (with coconut oil and coconut sugar for the glaze). Almost all organic. I started liking oatmeal on a random camping trip with a volunteer group in high school. It was the morning breakfast staple and it was loaded with sugars and syrup so I couldn't help but fall in love. Since then I've definitely learned to tone down the sugar level and boost the nutrition. Its super versatile and provides tons of energy. Only ate about 2/3rds of this but was such a lovely treat after my workout! #jaramae365 #100happydays #oatmeal #breakfast #breakfastofchampions #postworkout #snack #bananas #cashew #butter #granola #chiaseeds #almonds #filling #warm #delicious #oats #steelcutoats #cleaneats #wholesome #organic #healthybreakfast

Today is Cinco de Mayo! Last year, my sis and I celebrated by having mexican food for brunch and dinner. No such celebrations this year but in honor of today, I cooked up more tacos. This time I went vegetarian. Organic tofu strips marinated in gochujang (didn't have any chipotle so Asian twist instead), organic refried black beans, a salsa made of corn, @daiyafoods cheddar cheese, tomatoes and red/green onions and fresh cabbage slaw for crunch - All on top of organic corn tortillas. Side of organic guac and lime for squeezing. Definitely delicious! 🍴 #jaramae365 #100happydays #cincodemayo #mexican #mexicanfood #mexicanTO #tacos #taco #vegetarian #tofu #salsa #guacamole #guac #homemade #homecooking #organic #wholesome #glutenfree #dairyfree #instafood #latergram #nofilter

Sunday is Runday! 🏃 Getting slowly better at this. Practicing running almost everyday now. Took a minute and a half off since my first run. Going for speed at the moment. Once I improve that, I'll aim for distance/endurance. I was always better as a sprinter anyways.

One of the family dinners this week. Slow cooked lemongrass coconut chicken. This was my first try at cooking a whole chicken in a slow cooker and it worked out great. Kept it moist and didn't have to worry about it overcooking or changing the temp. Then broiled in the oven to crisp up the outside. Definitely an easier, more guaranteed cooking method.

Last night's dinner. Inspired to make homemade tacos. Not at all authentic, just random things thrown together. Organic beef mixed with tofu and chunks of pineapple with my own seasoning including a guavaberry sauce. @daiyafoods shredded cheddar cheese since I'm mostly dairy free these days. Slaw of jicama, cabbage, carrots, cucumber in  simple dressing. Kale avocado guac to top it off and add creaminess back to it.

Went on a run yesterday afternoon. Loving the cool yet sunny weather. Going to take advantage of it before we move into those unbearable hot months by training to run outside. Now, I can last on the treadmill pretty well both for endurance and distance. Of course I still need to walk and jog in between but I've come a long way - but running outside is a whole different experience. Its always been my downfall. I can play sports, bike for miles, tread water endlessly but ask me to run any distance and I'm instantly intimidated. But no more of that. I'm changing that this year. I'm timing it and tracking my progress. Hopefully I have some awesome results to share in a few weeks time! :) #jaramae365 #100happydays #runner #running #run #training #progress #jaramaefit

Saturday #ootd I've owned this pink skirt for years and years. (maybe 5+ years now) Not entirely sure how I got it. I never knew how to properly style it and always felt like my tummy looked awful in it. Today is the first day I've ever worn it and I'm glad I never got rid of it. Truly felt beautiful and completely myself in it. Always honor your inner self. Always find your beauty. Hope your weekend is going well and filled with sunshine and laughter.✌&💜 😊! #jaramae365 #100happydays #effyourbeautystandards

Perfect salmon meal. I'm obsessed with eating salmon. It's my go to protein. Spice rubbed and cooked in a bit of coconut oil. No overcooked salmon for me. Rice and raw veggies to complete 🍴 #jaramaefit #jaramae365 #salmon #meal #delicious #balanced #eatingright #100happydays

Legit, brunch has to be my favorite meal. Its literally the best of two meals. ☕🍳🍴 Getting here on the weekend was a serious mission but even my sis agreed that it was worth the wait. Its been on my foodie checklist for a while now. Couldnt stop by and not get a taste of the fried chicken. 🍗 I actually couldn't finish my whole meal sadly. Need to up my eating game. :( Beast mode eating next time. #jaramae365 #100happydays #brunch #toronto #thestockyards #torontoeats #weekend #sundaybrunch #latergram #friedchicken #chickenandwaffles #eggs #eggsbenedict #glutton

Been looking for an alternative to yogurt as I try to limit my dairy intake. I can often feel a little sick after too much dairy. I've already switched to unsweetened almond milk but didn't want to give up traditional yogurt just yet. Decided on a whim to give this a try and it was soooo good! I don't typically buy flavoured yogurt (esp cause I don't need the added sugars) but I was too scared to try it plain first. #jaramae365 #jaramaefit #coconutmilk #yogurt #dairyfree #sodelicious #strawberry #flavoured #latergram

Well spring may be interrupted outside but green goodness still continues. Green juice to reboot after lots of empty carbs lately. Ingredients: kale, cucumber, apple, pineapple, lemon, pears, ginger - listed from most to least. Originally ended up tasting too watery so I upped the amount of lemon. Is it just me but I like my green juices to taste earthy? That vegetable/grassy smell and taste (as my sis likes to put it) is what I love most about it! #jaramae365 #jaramaefit #100happydays

I remember collecting sap and watching them tap with the bucket years and years ago when I last visited a sugar shack. You were hella proud when you were able to collect something to put in the giant vat. Modern tubing system on the right. The guy touring us was the owner of the farm.

It was one of those incredible, perfect, memorable weekends spent exploring. From all the way up in Aurora to the core streets of downtown, it was a weekend full of adventure. Plenty of photos to come (although my phone died pretty quickly yesterday 😣) and there's still more to see this week! I'm especially grateful for the beautiful weather and the fact that spring is really settling in. Keep enjoying it out there everyone and have a great week! ✌& 💜 #jaramae365 #spring #springtime #weekend #weekendadventure #adventure #exploring #toronto

After a low night, my sister and I decides to escape the city for a while and venture to the farm to see a sugar bush/sugar shack to appreciate the fine craft of making maple syrup. A truly Canadian activity!

I think the world is trying to send me a message. All seen today from IGs that I follow. The world is listening and if you pay attention, it sends signs to redirect your energy/mind. Better take note from the universe. Tomorrow we start fresh and I will choose to not let this get to me anymore. And deciding that, I already feel a whole lot better :) I appreciate you allowing me to rant. Lots of beautiful photos to share with you tomorrow ❤ #jaramae365 #ihadtovent #100happydays

'Ruin' might be a bit dramatic. Had a tough night last night and things are still mulling over in my mind. I know everyone says to just not give a f*ck but... I'm not like that. Things cut deep, I get the feels and sometimes the heart breaks. It's a shame I let people and things sit on my mind knowing that it's not affecting the other side at all. Its a waste of my time and emotions to continue to care. So Im trying as best I can to just get over it. What little affect remains, I will use to fuel my desire to be better in every way. I will be stronger than all of this and know that I am better. #sorryforranting #ihadtovent #jaramae365

🌺🌸🌻🌼🌺 I'm addicted to waking up with flowers on my bedside table. I used to only crave roses and orchids but realized the beauty in all kinds of flowers and even filler flowers.

Whats in your fridge? One of my chores in the house is to maintain the fridge - keep it clean, organize it, cook the food in it and sometimes stock it with what I want to eat. Its a rather personal and interesting photo because what you store in here, makes its way into you body and in turn, becomes your body. Now not everything in here is 100% clean, organic, natural, or unprocessed but my family and myself in particular, try to stock it as best we can with plenty of healthy choices. At a minimum maybe 75% of the fridge is stocked with certified organic or natural wholesome food. So despite my size and overindulgence in food, my body is healthy and sustained on good vitamin rich food. I'm the kind of person who regularly just walks over to the fridge to open it and see what we have. And if you're like that too, I hope you take a good look the next time and scan to see if you have the right stuff to nourish both your body and soul. Always make your health a priority! #jaramae365 #jaramaefit #latergram #fridge #groceries #food #livewell

On top of meal prep, I also prep my water. With an abundance of fruit esp lemons and my newfound enjoyment of naturally flavoured watered, I prepacked water packets. I froze them so I can easily drop them into my water as I go along.

The shrimp doesn't exactly make this super clean but sometimes feeding the soul does better for the body overall. At least that's how I'm going to spin it :P Warm plain congee underneath, topped with seeds, nuts, herbs and furikake and a side of cucumbers to add something cold and fresh.

I've never really done #tbt because I don't  really have much to visually reflect on. But as I was cleaning my room the other day, I rediscovered this gem. Its been on my bulletin board almost since the time I took it which was in highschool (I left it on there still). Probably 16 at the time. I spent almost all my time with @ericccch in our school years. I probably wouldn't have gotten through elementary and certainly my first year if high school without this smarty pants. Haven't seen him now in years but I hope he's doing well. Just a friendly reminder that in small ways, you're still on my mind...wishing you well always :) #jaramae365 #100happydays #ohthememories #highschooldays #backinthegoodolddays

One of the many beautiful shots I was able to take on a weekend walk with my sister. Time for my favorite season of the year - spring! Can't wait for the new leaves and flowers. I'm starting a few new things to get myself motivated. Taking part in the #100happydays because we could all use daily reminders of the things that bring us joy in life. Tomorrow is officially my one month mark of bringing #yoga back into my life. Now that I've been reintroduced and in love with the practice, I will be focusing on doing it much more regularly as part of the #FreshStartYoga journey. ✌ & 💜! #jaramae365 #spring #refresh #renew

I did my first full flow on my own at home. It was just as challenging as in class, even without the heat. Took time to really align myself and give time to breath and adapt to the different poses. The mat is starting to be my home, my center and my therapy. Hopefully someday soon I can show my poses in pictures and really deepen my practice. Please excuse my ugly feet if that's the kind of thing that grosses you out. :P Hope your weekend was full of smile and sunshine ❤ #jaramaefit #jaramae365 #yoga

After a solid night's sleep (which is not a common occurrence) I woke up feeling rested but hungry. I don't typically make big breakfasts but to celebrate my early rise, I'd give it a shot.

Don't worry, be happy 🎵 My body is not pleased with me this week and is completely sore. Lots of new bruises and scars all over. But I managed to push through. Add in the gloomy weather and its resulted in some low moods too. So I have my little friend to remind me to smile. It was a random gift from my family and its just like a magic 8 ball, only this one says nice positive things. You've seen him before in some of my other posts and just wanted to explain. In any case, continue to have a wonderful weekend all!! :)

I don't post too often about my workouts because I think food is more interesting 😝 but I'm proud of this one. Did box jumps yesterday for an hour with my trainer and set a new personal best with a 14 stack (including top level), 5 reps at a time. Keep in mind I'm only 5'1 at best and very far from my target weight but I managed to straight vertical jump this (no pre-step or run up). I did them on my own this past Sunday and only did 13 so just goes to show there's always room for improvement every day. It is pretty much half my height. There were a few misses and new bruises to show for it but for the most part, landed rather solidly. When I first started months ago, I could only jump about 3-4 stacks before getting exhausted. I got a lot of people - my trainer, other trainers, super fit people and regular gym goers come up to me and tell me how impressed they were. Feels good to know that despite minimal change in weight and less than obvious changes in my physique, I am getting stronger and better every day. And honestly that's what counts the most. I'll get there with each step. Always keep pushing. Every day is a chance to be better, do better, live better. :) #jaramae365 #jaramaefit

Water all day, every day! I pretty much only consume water but I thought I'd step it up and do a better job of hydrating my body right and regularly. Especially as I develop my yoga practice. Warm lemon water in the morning to get my digestion going and reboot my body. Regular water all day, trying to get as much in. White tea mid morning to fill me up after breakfast. And ice cold fruit infused water for taste when I get sick of all the warm liquid. #jaramae365 #jaramaefit #water #tea #fruit #lemonwater #hydrate #drink #drinkup

Getting into the habit of bringing flowers 🌺 into my room each week. Nothing expensive, just whatever is on sale and looks like it'll last a week or two.

#1 reason for being MIA was time spent healing up from this car accident that happened a week ago while out with friends. Had quite a headache every time I looked at screens. Doing much better now though, so dont fret :) On top of that...workouts, boys/friends, general clean up/organization, events and injuries have kept me rather occupied and away from the world of instagram. Just means its time to catch up :) #onedayatatime #missedyouguys #jaramae365

Forgot to post this from friday. Happened to walk by this setup at the #eatoncentre. They were giving away cupcakes, chocolate and pins as we watched the opening ceremonies. #gocanadago #teamcanada #sochi2014 #winterolympics #sochiolympics #jaramae365

Forgot to post this yesterday for #worldnutelladay. I actually owe a lot to that day and site as it provided a jump start to my food writing hobby many years ago. I Dont indulge in this stuff the way I used to in my university years but its a yummy treat now and again. #nutella #jaramae365

Quickly picked this up after hearing about #musclemilk. Vanilla flavored. I got through about 1/3 of it before being overwhelmed with the sweetness. Tasted good but needs to be diluted more for my tastes #jaramae365

This morning's late clean breakfast courtesy of @blogilates. Swiss oatmeal as its called. I'm finally getting the hang of eating apples. l (which is mixed in here with dry rolled oats, Greek yogurt, raisins and almonds with a splash of almond milk) I've discovered honey crisps are my fav apples. #latergram

For filipino food lovers out there... This was my #cheatmeal yesterday for my parents anniversary party. Everything was pretty yummy and its been two weeks of straight #cleaneating since I last had truly salty, fatty foods. Consisted of sisig, palabok, kare kare and crispy pata. Needless to say i got pretty sick fast lol. I think it was overkill for my stomach. Not sure if it was entirely worth it but its come and gone and I'm back to the healthy grind. #filipinostyle #filipinofood #filipino

A day filled with so much love, happiness and celebration. Theyre still just two crazy kids in love. And life wouldnt be the same without them. 💑💞
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dd549070bf3868611c48d66d37a5aa79/5BD3B921/t51.2885-15/e15/926361_256037294561123_329768338_n.jpg
25 years ago these two crazy kids fell in love and started a whole new life together. They are the guiding example of love, friendship, commitment, determination, loyalty and understanding. I am so blessed to be a product of their enduring love and continually in awe of their journey. Im sure the two people in the photo had no idea that they'd be where they are today. May God bless them with many more happy years together as one entity united in their faith and love. 💑💒💌💍💐 love you both always!!!

I couldnt post this up sooner in case family or friends saw. It had its big reveal during our nye party. I know @bellabelladonna wanted to see the transformation. Dont have before photos readily available but you get the idea. Super dated kitchen revamped. We also tore down the pantry wall to convert it to more counter and cupboard space (not really seen here). But Tadah!! Its a pretty awesome kitchen👍 #jaramae365

Dinners this week consist of baked salmon and finishing up leftover food from last week - baked spaghetti squash, roasted cauliflower and quinoa. The salmon is soooooo good. Better than last week's dinners. #jaramae365

Another tough day. Cravings are getting stronger and I'm just not in the mood the last two days. After taking a short nap and inspiration session with photos from lovely people on here, I forced myself to work out today for an hour. Felt tired but glad that I pushed myself to do it. Results do not come overnight. Every day is a step. Even if I screw up, every minute (not just every day) is a chance to make it right again. So even though I gave in to a little excess today. I pushed through and thats what counts. #thestruggleisreal #butyoucandoit #jaramae365

Didn't get a chance to take a decent picture of anything so thought I'd do a #latergram of my lunch on sunday. Wasnt entirely supposed to have whole boiled eggs but since I hadn't eaten breakfast I figured a yolk or two wouldnt hurt. Had a doc appt. Body is still sore but back at it tomorrow. Hope everyone has a good Monday #jaramae365

Bought 24 mason jars to make #mealprep easier. Now the rest of the family has containers to bring their lunches. Super convenient and affordable. Sides are killing me from Fridays workout still. Spent all afternoon cooking up food for today and the rest of the week. All set for wk 2. Hope everyone had a good weekend 😃 #jaramae365

This is my office drawer filled with goodies. I actually haven't eaten much from it since organizing it. Its mostly there as a 'just in case' I forgot to bring breakfast, need an alternative snack, need supplements..etc. Not all healthy choices but keeps me from buying anything anymore. #jaramae365 #snackdrawer #secretstash #food

Tea anyone? The flavours i choose are not exactly the healthiest or most detoxing tea. If you know me, you'd know I hate warm drinks so this is a big change for me. I drink tea every morning now and use it as a sweet treat. Teavana was having a 75% sale so I couldnt help myself. #teafordays #blueberrybliss #pineapplekonapop #raspberrypineapple #teavana #teatime #jaramae365

Christmas gift from the folks in keeping with my theme to better my health and habits. Tracking everything these days. Every day is a challenge. But I'll get there.

Photos taken in NYC at the #timessquaremuseum where you can see the ball and the lighted numbers before the actual drop. #nyc Jan 1st of each year is the most hopeful of days. At no singular point are more people united in hope for change and improvement. I have plenty of goals this year and I hope to reach as many if not all. Its clichéd and cheesy to pick today to make new plans but do it anyways. This is one bandwagon I don't mind getting on. #happynewyears #2014

Last selfies of the year. I hope you all have an amazing 2013. Its been one of the most difficult emotionally for me, esp the last few months of the year. But I hope 2014 brings great positive change. From LA, San Diego, Boston, NYC, MTL, Cape Cod....its been a year of adventure. For the first time, I'm eager to know whats on the horizon. I feel the winds change. May you be blessed and loved all throughout the year. #goodbye2013 #2014
