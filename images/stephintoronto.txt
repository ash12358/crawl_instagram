If this week has taught ppl anything it is that success and fame do not alleviate #depression #mentalillness and #suicide for people. This has been an incredibly difficult week & weekend for many including me. Mental illness is something that is difficult to talk about but important to talk about. Reach out and ask those closest to you how they are doing? Offer to go for a coffee and sit in silence if that is all they need. Listen. Don’t tell them that they should feel better because it’s sunny outside (a more ridiculous thing I have never heard), bake them a cake, send them flowers, tell them you love them, tell them you are thinking about them..... do it before it’s too late and you are sorry you didn’t reach out because you could have. Look after yourself. Ask for help. Go for coffee. Get a mani. DM me. I’m feeling shitty but I’ll try and respond #youarenotalone #takecareofyourcommunity #selfcare #endstigma @camhfoundation

My mother is the matriarch of this brood of many.  We are so lucky to have her. She is a wonderful friend, a great example to her daughter's and grandchildren, has style like few others, is an amazing hostess to so many, believes that it is always 5 o'clock somewhere, is an amazing grandmother & wife. How she does everything that she does, no one is quite sure, other than she never stops.  We are lucky to have her. #happymothersday

There are mother's that you are born to and then there are "second mom's". Women who you love and they love you unconditionally even though they don't have too. This gorgeous lady was a 2nd mum to me and I miss her all the time especially on these spring days when we use to walk and brunch for hours. This pic now sits above my bed and I feel so lucky to have had her on my team. Thank you so much Sandy for being so amazing and for @jgdinc for lending her to me on occasion.

And so it begins, Womens right's to choose have been taken away in Iowa. 6 wks is when u hear a heartbeat. Trumpy Wumpy and the pro life, oppressive right have begun the sweep. The scariest part of his presidency for me is replacement of so many judges across the land with right wing, conservative nut bars who are going to make laws like this so much easier to pass. You did this to yourselves America but I am crying for your future and the future of women, minorities, children, men, human kind.... Let's face it everyone who is not a Trump.

This is a truly interesting panel of well thought out and highly respected and smart individuals in the "Risk" space and I have respect for each of them, but we have to look for women to sit on every single panel. A group of male, 80% white panel does nothing for an industry that says it is trying to change, trying to be more inclusive. #whendidibecomesuchafeminist #womenintech #fintech #startup #startuplife @rotmanevents @rotmanevents #machinelearning

"No benefits are paid for injury or death resulting from: intentionally self-induced injury or #suicide" reading through new health care package and this always makes me iterate. No coverage if you are so sick that you try and kill your self and are successful or unsuccessful and end up completely disfigured or incapable of working etc. I have so much to say, but my heart hurts too much to say it. #mentalhealth #depression #bipolar #endstigma @camhnews

Why I think what you were under your clothes is as important as your clothes and why I think Cora aka @thelingerieaddict is amazing.  If you like gorgeous lingerie, strong amazing women, #fempreneur and wonderful people, follow her. Plus she has a book coming out. She's doing it all.  #Repost @thelingerieaddict with @get_repost ・・・ Lingerie is more than bra fit or shapewear or even beautiful fabrics and laces. Lingerie is a way for us to express ourselves, to connect with our innermost identities, even if they have to be secret from the rest of the world. We live in a time now where so many people are feeling unsafe and feeling attacked, that holding onto those refuges - those places where we can be our truest self - is more important than ever before. I hope TLA feels like a space where you can safely be who you are. Thank you for sticking me with me for the last 10 years. 💖 #intimates #styleguide #InIntimateDetail #bookstagram #thelingerieaddict

Late Saturday night date night trips home on an empty tube car.... Hard to justify an Uber when your new home is a hop skip and jump from the subway. And yes I have my feet on the seat.

This article in the @nytimes @theupshotnyt onthe Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys is one of the most impactful, shocking, thought provoking things I have read in ages. I physically felt sick after reading it. They spent 30 yrs following 10k boys of different races and these are their findings. I am sad and angry and mad at the society that I live in. I thought that we were better than this, though not be much. The worst part is, as an upper class white woman, I don't know what I can do to make it better. I've got my action cap on though and I'm on it. I'm so nauseous about this I can't even tell you. If you have not spent the time, go now to the Times website and do it. The link is https://nyti.ms/2tYGuMu and I'll put it in my profile. Also @nytimes podcast The Daily did an en excellent show on it today. The whole NYT deserves gold stars ✨ these days.

I have finally found one thing I like about TW his "45" monogram - a clear extension of his ego... before I couldn't think of one think thing that I liked about TrumpyWumpy (as he's known in our family) but I do have a deep respect for the mans immense ego and self esteem. One that seems to be so huge and self inflated that I just am in awe at it's size. Let's not forget that I love a good monogram.

Having a drink with my favourite alpine countrymen (the Swiss), one of my favourite bracelets, and thinking about one of my favourite ppl @luiscolourist on his birthday. I've known Luis for close to 1/2 our lives now and he has always and will always be an amazing friend. He accepts me where I am when I see him and doesn't expect me to be anything but myself. He has always been supportive of what I am going through and we connect on a level more than just a client and service provider but as friends. I have sent countless people to see him and his staff and everyone has said what a good experience it has been at @medullacoqueenwest and @medullacoyorkville it has been my absolute pleasure to do so.

I would like to lie and tell you that I have had a super productive day, I've crossed the 20 things off of my to do list that I planned too, I've worked out, grocery shopped etc.... But instead I'm still in my PJs contemplating crawling back into bed and staring out at this totally gross weather..... Oh February, you make it hard for me to be a human being.

Book 4 of the #26of2018 reading project done and is Al Frankens "Giant of the Senate". I'm not sure what to say about the book. It had been on my list for a while given his past SNL time and his transition to be a US senator. I really liked it and loved the passion that he clearly has for so many issues including those of womens rights. Knowing what I know now, a yr after the end of the book and him stepping down from the senate I feel v mixed on its contents and those feelings. Very emotionally complicated when reading it given I know how it eventually ends for him. #ilovebooks #instabook #books #igbooks

The colour was just too beautiful not to capture. Blood oranges and #glutenfree fruit and nut bar left over from christmas is #whatsforbreakfast When I have a blistering #migraine I rarely feel like eating, but it is the rare time I can eat citrus (it's a #migrainetrigger) for me.

The v best thing about 2017 was #Londonsis and her husband and son became Brexit refugees and moved home. Pictures like this confirm how happy it has made my dad and the little one seems to be liking it too.

I read this book w my niece over the holidays and it is amazing. If you have girls or are raising strong amazing boys pick up and read "The Case of RBG vs Inequality". Lots of things were able to be discussed like sexism in schools, the Supreme Court, why the impact of Trump and his assholic ways will be felt for years and years to come, the impact of his choice on the judiciary system and women's rights, women's rights over the yrs and the amazing work that #RBG has done, how one voice, one powerful female voice can make a difference and how women can make a difference and deserve to be heard. If you don't know anything or enough about the ever fabulous #ruthbaderginsburg the book is great. Available at the @torontolibrary and on @amazoncan and @chaptersindigo Some amazing parents who are trying to raise strong kids and some ppl that I think Wld love it @tee2the_kay  @megross10 @cristinlazier @missericaspix @theroosma @aynsleyd @jessicazackheim @jesschaffin @jessicamulroney @indigirl @heathersenst @scaceis @barlowreid_design @ddomelleparsons @jennie_cotton @christiechapman @suzannecohon @dtp0406 @elizabethdyer @egc22 @tonichris @arielfoxman @andrewjfortier @lfortier10 @heathrutnobbs @indigirl @jarvstrong @jessseinfeld @jimjarvstrong @juddapatow @lorenapscott @leighmcg3 @laurenblauren @mnlevesque @prycesalamon @gwynethpaltrow @vastfit #women #nastywoman

I can't believe that it's 3 in the morning and I feel that it's important to write about @aveenoca @aveenous Excema Care Itch Relief Balm. My hands and feet and elbows are driving me 🍌 with itchiness. Anyone who has Excema knows the stage I'm at. The time when you just want to crawl out of your own limbs and leave them behind, like I don't need hands, why do I need hands??? Especially those hands with bugs crawling all over them?!?!?!? Arghhhhhhh.  This stuff has been awesome!!! Yes it is greasy if you are greedy like me and put a huge blob on in hopes of instant relief, but not if you put on a respectable amount and rub it in. I love that it forms a great barrier to other irritants and doesn't leave residue (or much anyway) all over my phone and iPad. You can see in my hand that all though they are really red and puffy from the irritation of Excema the pealing and general grossness of it is being immediately helped by this, my hydrocortisone cream from my dermatologist, @blissworld moisturising gloves, icepacks and serious will power. Thanks again to @chickadvisor & @aveenoca for #gotitforfree for asking me to try this. It came at the perfect time!!!! #excema #dermatologist #dermatology #dermatologytips #productreview

"We can only appreciate the miracle of a sunrise if we have waited in the darkness." Sapna Reddy I've made a particular point of not going to the beach in the early hrs of the morning (one of my fave times) because I love it, but need sleep more these two weeks. This morning its call was too much even for my pillow to win over. #sunrise

Book 3 of #26of2018 "The Mistress of Nothing" by Kate Pullinger @katepullinger complete. Based on a true story and related to the book from the 1800s "Letters from Egypt" it won the GG award a few years ago. It was a quick and good read. It was not life altering and I don't think that it is one that I will revisit in a few months but really enjoyable. #books #igbooks #ilovebooks #instabooks #bookstagram #reading

Book 2 of #26of2018 finished "The Way to The Spring - Life and Death in Palestine" by Ben Ehrenreich @penguinrandomca @penguinpress was phenomenal. It was such a difficult and intense read but worth every page. I've read so many books on #isreal and none on Palestine specifically and this was eye opening, shocking, well written and perfectly timed read. I will be thinking about it for a long time. After my trip to Israel and my visit to the west bank and Gaza strip this was such a wonderful companion read as I hadn't found a book from a purely Palestinian view. #ilovebooks #books #reading #instabooks #bookstagram

Book 1 of the #26of2018 finished yesterday. "The Girl At The Savoy" by Hazel Gaynor. To be fair I started it a few days before the new year. I took it out of the library and it was fine. Nothing too special and nothing to horrible. It was fine to read on the beach and a good read in between a very heavy read that I am reading about Palestine. #books #ilovebooks #igbooks #reading #instabooks #bookstagram

As 2018 is here I am looking at trying to read 26 books this yr. To qualify on my list I must complete the book. I read parts of plenty of books over the year. It all depends on how my #mentalhealth is. When my #depression or #bipolardisorder is not in control then I find it very difficult to read so I take every opportunity to read when I can. I find books at some of my fave independent bookshops @typebooks @benmcnallybooks @dauntbooks @hatchardspiccadilly @bookcityto @thestrand on the @nytimes must read lists @thisisbillgates reading lists, from friends, @globeandmail lists, from magazines like @forbes @entrepreneur @voguemagazine @vanityfair @harpersbazaarus and I look to publishers like @harpercollinsca @penguinrandomca and others #ilovebooks #books #intsabooks #reading #booksofinstagram

Two views of 1 of 3 #christmastree in my little one bedroom co-op. Love this silver tree with the silver glitter village underneath and the fascia lights. I've had this tree for 10 yrs and I haven't set it up, or any of my other holiday decor since I got sick 9 yrs ago. It's a story for another day, but I'm happy I pulled them out this December.

Floor to ceiling windows make the #viewfromhere from my pillow on a freezing day particularly gorgeous. Having lived in Saskatoon the biggest take away from the winters was "if the sky is clear and bright blue it's freezing cold outside, too cold for clouds."

Today I went outside, and not because I had to, because I forced myself too. Reminder that this time of year is one of the most difficult for those of us with #depression & #mentalillness of all types. While it may be a time of cheer, merriment, social events, family and friends, for many it is a time or crippling sadness, loneliness, anger, solitude and depression.  No matter how much family or smiles or wealth they seem to have inside can be a different story. Sending many of you a hug of strength and empathy. #YesterdayIHadAShower and that was a huge accomplishment so I understand. I'm really sorry I can't credit this sticker, I can't remember who sent it to me. #sicknotweak #bipolar #bipolardepression #spoonie #mentaheath

Two types of fruitcake made this year and this one is eatable right out of the oven and I didn’t put any alcohol in it so that kids love it. It is also #glutenfree and so full of fresh dried fruit and nuts.  It is so dense and delicious. First time I made this recipe and it is great on a cheese plate, for breakfast, for a midnight snack and I love that it is so low in sugar and so high in real food. #eatrealfood #eatfood #eatfoodmostlyplants #eatfoodsmostlyplantsnotsomuch #fruitcake

I am constantly GobSmacked these last 18 mths and the Roy Moore situation has me walking around nauseous. Not only is the Ass Hat president a sexual assaulter but he is now condoning the election of a sexual predator of a 14 yr old girl amoung other things. What do we say to ourselves and our children about these ppl who are the leaders of the free world??? I just can't even.  The Democratic Coalition is raising money to put this outside of this assholes office. Visit the following website of Act Blue to support  https://secure.actblue.com/donate/roy-moore-billboard give yourself and the world a little December present.

Festivus, my weird mix of non religious Christmas, non actually being Jewish celebration of Channukah, celebration of longer days etc. Has thrown up on my apt. It's the first time in a many many yrs.

40+ years of family tradition continued tonight at Country Style. It was the 2nd time in 3 days that I had left my apt and I can eat nothing on that plate but the joy of seeing my nephew and family enjoying themselves was worth it!  #torontoicons #schnitzel #easterneuropeanfood #schmorgesborg #meatopia #meatcoma

I have spent 2 1/2 days in bed this week with crippling #migraine I think it's very hard for people to understand the impact chronic pain like this has on people. Half of my week totally hijacked by pain that I could not control even with the drugs the meditation the ice the self care etc. So hard for ppl to understand. #spoonie #chronicpain #chronicillness

Instead of doing it all at the last minute I've decided to tackle some of my christmas wrapping early, slightly out of the necessity that everything is in pikes for everyone to see. Let's just say some people have been very naughty and some have been very nice. Thanks @nordstromto for being a great source for Santa to do her shopping.

Fellow #migraine sufferers meet my new best friend @icekap_migraine_therapy If it was socially acceptable, I'd be wearing it 24/7. 5 ice packs Velcroed in place in this amazingly hideous hat.

The things I do for my nieces. I think I'm regressing and I have a new potential career...reconstituting old #AmericanGirl to their former glory. This old Molly doll went to the spa at my house this weekend. I think she's looking pretty good for being 15+ yrs old..... in other news my psychotherapist will be so happy to hear that I got in touch with my inner 7 yr old. #badauntie

Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Cole Porter & Bing Crosby in 1956's "High Society". Could anything be more fabulous or more perfectly decadent on a Saturday night when it's gross outside???? So reminds me of my Babcia. We used to watch old movies the whole time. Ohh how she loved Sinatra and Kelly, who doesn't really???

Fantastically fun article in the @nytimesfashion @nytimes on Louise Linton and her ongoing lack of fashion awareness in the public eye with her husband Steve Mnuchin. Love some of the captions, especially @pappiness. I think she looks like Cruella or Kylo Ren,maybe the Matrix, if nothing else #trumpywumpy grp of #asshats made me laugh today.

At @UofT Listening to a panel on science and innovation including one of the smartest ppl I know, Dr Leah Cowen, she’s talking abt the importance of fundamental science and #innovation. She’s also talking about her research into treating drug resistant fungal infections (essentially what has tried to kill my mother in the past). She’s like a science superhero and is just amazing on so many levels. She’s a Professor & Chair, Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics & Infectious Disease at the Department of Molecular Genetics University of Toronto and the founder of Bright Angel Therapeutics. Keep up the great work Leah! #uoftentrepreneurship #uoftinnovation #supportthereport #innovation #startup #startuplife #accelerator #incubator #mentor #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship

Wonderful, quiet, peaceful, anxiety quelling breakfast for one @fstoronto @cafebouludto miss @jgdinc in the seat opposite me. Every time I eat at the @fstoronto I miss and think of @sarah.herman & @danielherman04 Sabba, Michael, one of my favorite ppl, and their great Zadie, Bernie, who I used to always bump into at breakfast at the old Four Seasons. Miss Michael so much every day (and Bernie of course).
