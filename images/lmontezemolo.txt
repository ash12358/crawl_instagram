At one point the captain took us into an area surrounded by icebergs and told us to be prepared to get to the middle of the boat and get low in case a piece sheared off near us. See, when tons of ice fall hundreds of feet a large tsunami-like wave follows. The boat can outrun the wave, but the captain has to act quickly and decisively, and when that happens you don't want any passengers going overboard. .

A pack of Greenland Dogs ("kalaallit qimmiat" in Greenlandic) lives right by the hotel where we stayed (@HotelArctic). They're working sled dogs during the winter months and seem to mostly rest and hang out during the warmer months. It was interesting to catch little bits of their daily routine. One thing's for sure: despite the calm demeanor of the pup pictured here, the pack is extremely in tune with their caretaker's comings and goings, particularly at meal time. Lots of excited jumping and uncontrollable howling as food is distributed to each dog. . üê∂üç¥üéâüê∂üç¥üéâüê∂üç¥üéâ . #greenland #greenlandpioneer #nikon #dog #husky #ilulissat  #travel #greenlanddog #sunset

If there's one thing I would 100% do again (repeatedly) on a future visit it would be our nightly 4-hour sunset boat tours. Floating around these incredible icebergs was one of the coolest experiences of my life. Some were enormous, and some were small, but each was unique, interesting, and full of compositional opportunities. And of course, only the top 10-15% of an iceberg floats above the surface, so even the small ones are actually pretty big. From time to time we would hear the crashing sound of an iceberg breaking, and occasionally a whale or two would show up, and swim around checking us out. . Thank you to @_chphoto and #LofotenTours for such a professionally run adventure, and to fellow participants @kearaellen and @siddharthprem for making it so fun. We were a small but mighty group! .

i c e - l a n d | j√∂kuls√°rl√≥n, iceland If you go to Iceland, there's a 99% chance you'll stop at J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n, the large glacial lagoon in the south of the country. Do yourself a favor and once you've toured the lagoon go to the black sand beach across the ring road from the lagoon parking area. On this beach, you'll see large chunks of ice like these that floated out to sea from the lagoon, only to be buffeted onto shore by incoming waves. It's such a cool phenomenon, but beware: the mini-icebergs are larger, heavier and move faster than you think. I probably still have the bruises to prove it :) Happy autumn weekend, everyone! ¬∑¬∑¬∑üçÉüçÇüçÅüçÇüçÅüçÉüçÇüçÅüçÇüçÅüçÉ¬∑¬∑¬∑ #iceland #visiticeland #mystopover #southiceland #resourcetravel #natureaddict #ig_iceland #nikon

w e a v e | marin county, california From an early August evening spent watching and capturing the incoming fog perched on a small rock with @larrynienkark and @nicholassteinbergphotography. It's a minor miracle that we all managed to NOT bump each other's tripods! . I spent this morning reviewing my Marin County photos from the past few months and I have to say, 2016 has been an AMAZING year for fog. While fog season is ending, I'm not too terribly sad because with the arrival of more upper level clouds we're now entering sunset season. . Many thanks to @colossal, @petapixel and @reddit for the recent attention they brought to my work. Also, a big hello and welcome to any new followers! üëãüëãüëã . Happy Sunday/Monday, everyone! . -Lorenzo

w i s p | marin headlands, california Low fog and a beautiful sunrise came together in a rare meeting near the Golden Gate Bridge back in early June. Several (ok, several hundred) of us were there to catch it, including fellow fogaholics @larrynienkark, @bastian.hoppe, @laly0021, @maxe30is and @stephenboylephotography.

For this one I was shooting alongside @bastian.hoppe, @larrynienkark, @laly0021, @maxe30is, and @stephenboylephotography.

don't call it frisco | san francisco, california ‚†Ä‚†Ä There's a big division of opinion in our city. I don't mean over gentrification, short-term rentals, or the love/hate relationship the residents have with the tech industry. No, I'm talking about whether it's acceptable to call it "Frisco," "San Fran" or "SF." Most actually agree it's ok to call it "The City," but people get downright snippy about those other three nicknames. ‚†Ä‚†Ä What say you?

f i n a l e | anaheim, california I went to Disneyland for the first time this week. At the World of Color performance I spotted a little kid play-conducting from high atop his dad's shoulders. He killed it! Happy Friday! #tgif #disney #worldofcolor #california #visitcalifornia

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä first time at the rodeo | marin county, ca ‚†Ä‚†Ä Last night @larrynienkark, @bastian.hoppe and I caught a really nice one at Rodeo Beach. I can't get over how warm it was; it was 77¬∞ with killer clouds when I pulled up. The bugs were out in full force. I'm sad to report that 42 sandflies lost their lives in the making of this photo. Swat - click - swat -click - swat - click, repeat. Anyway, flies notwithstanding we had amazing conditions waaaaaay past sunset, which is always a good reminder to resist the urge to pack up and head home as soon as the big yellow ball drops below the horizon. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Happy Monday/Tuesday, y'all! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä ¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞ Can't forget to mention that @resourcetravel and @ig_iceland recently featured my work.

s t r i a t e d | marin county, california ___________________________________ This past Sunday night at Mt Tam was one for the books. The fog rolled in fast and thick over the ridges, and the  upper-level cloud cover made for a colorful sunset -- pretty perfect if you ask me. It was great shooting the fog alongside @larrynienkark, @_jonathanmitchell_, @kristen.rankin and @kristinagate. My gear and I are off to the Eastern Sierra after work tomorrow for a four day photo bender. I can't wait! #ig_fogaholics #sfbayphotos #sfbayarea #norcal #california #visitcalifornia #resourcetravel

t e r m i n u s | j√∂kuls√°rl√≥n, iceland Ever since visiting the black volcanic beach where I took this photo, I've been describing these as "baby icebergs." In fact, they're the complete opposite. Landing on this beach is the final stop on a 1000+ year journey from snowflake back to water, so I guess from now on I should refer to them as elderly!

Grabbed this one a few years ago on a walk through my old neighborhood.  Almost had to do some mild trespassing to a good photo, but luckily the owner was nice enough to let me through the gate. In my excitement I forgot to ask what kind of tree it was. Do any if you junior botanists know?

daybreak | hamn√∏y, norway ___________________________ Normally the photos you see of the red fishing cabins (rorbuer) in Hamn√∏y are taken from almost exactly the opposite direction. I have a photo or two of *that* view as well if you dig through my previous posts. But on this particular morning, I couldn't pass up capturing the first direct light to hit these rustic small red dwellings and the boats docked around them. One of those cabins was my home for a week in Feb 2014, and every time I see a photo of Hamn√∏y (mine or someone else's) I'm instantly transported back to this wonderful, beautiful and peaceful little corner of the world.

burn, baby, burn | san francisco _________________________ I trekked down to Kirby Cove in the dark a few weeks ago to catch a nice early winter sunrise. It's always *the idea* of having to wake up so horribly early that gets me; once I'm there standing on the beach waiting for the sun to rise, it's actually quite wonderful.

z i g ~ z a g | flakstadoy, norway I can't get over what a fortunate chance decision we made taking this road along this placid little fjord. It brought us to the perfect spot for capturing the aurora with awesome moonlit peaks and great reflections in the foreground.

one last stop | fredvang, norway _________________________ So...it's the last night of your week-long Lofoten Islands trip and you *finally* get an amazing all-night aurora show. And as daybreak approaches you're supposed to just collapse your tripod, pack up your gear and head straight back toward the ferry back to the mainland?! Fine, but not without a few stops along the way :) #nikon_photography_ #nikon #beautifulplaces #northernlightsphotos #ig_northernlights

b r u l √© e | san francisco, california Snapped this #latergram on a nice July evening after having driven back from LA to SF. I guess the drive wasn't tiring enough, so I decided to add a hike in as well. I spent a few hours exploring and shooting various compositions, then made good use of my headlamp for the hike back up to the trailhead. This will be my first time posting a photo to @instagram before posting it to Flickr, 500px and FB. Change is good.  Happy weekend, y'all! #sanfrancisco #sfbayarea #sf #sfbayphotos #norcal #california
