This school year - my fifteenth as a teacher - held some remarkably challenging times. Times of stretching and pressing and feeling like breaking... But, even more than that, it held authentic reminders of how God is always faithful and, even though I can't possibly understand how He works or why he allows some hard things to touch our lives, I can completely trust in His goodness. Our Father is inexhaustible and unfathomably loving. I don't need to know everything...I just need to know Him.

If I look back through photos that @shani_baby_ and I have taken together over the course of the past three years, it becomes quickly evident that I look nearly exactly the same in every shot. It's almost as though she has a cardboard Cosand cutout that she poses with. Fortunately, she has the remarkable ability of being beautifully expressive and original from every angle. üòç

Sunshine, blue skies, and someone remarkable to share it with. I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon.

My students and their wonderful families made me feel incredibly appreciated this week through so many thoughtful gifts, endearing notes, and warm hugs. The icing on the cake - literally - was this Kinnaman creation in the shape of my alter ego, Mr. Nugget. Thank you, Lily, for making our classroom a sweet place.

Everyday in my classroom, I work with students who have a gazillion questions. Every new development...every changing moment...produces a new "why?". I try to give them an environment in which they can question and explore and learn without fearing that a wrong turn is the end of the world. As a man of faith, I try to live with the recognition that the God who gives new mercies every morning and who knows my evey fear is completely capable of facing my questions and confusions. Living curiously...seeing the wonder and beauty and perplexity around me. Failing gloriously...knowing that every stumbling step is an opportunity for the love and grace of Christ to shine with depth and purpose.

This woman - @shani_baby_ - embodies joy and life. She never backs down and always holds fast to faith. This morning, she told me that life is all about the little dances. I think she's correct. üòä (I don't usually highjack photos someone else shot...but I'm making an exception today.)

Some days, some weeks, the unwieldy weight of our fallen humanness seems so very dark and overwhelming. May our hope ever be in Higher Things. May our hands ever be busy holding out love.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3d22975b3384c8b9b2dde19fab7eb051/5BD0CBE8/t51.2885-15/e35/13549618_118702848562134_975083152_n.jpg
I've walked this road more times than I can possibly count. In the frozen mornings of steel-skied winter...in the heat-infused shimmer of a high desert summer...beneath clear, seamless blue skies and canopies of constellations that exhaust my ability to number. And every step has known what it is to be loved.

This morning, riding the back roads of the valley, I was struck by the reality that my lacking...my inadequacies...my confusion...none of it reflects or detracts from the absolute sufficiency of God. No storm, no trouble, no moment of uncertainty can possibly diminish the reality of His love and strength. And so...it is well.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/42c2972929c1507e30d8ee5f9317f9e6/5BCB8144/t51.2885-15/e35/13584179_1086836891391358_1571461239_n.jpg
It's easy for me to get caught up in worrying about what ifs...it can be immobilizing. Today, I'm trying to focus on the overwhelming goodness of a Creator who knows the whole story: beginning, middle, and end.

Laughter is one of those things that transforms a day from being merely a number on a calendar to a full-fledged memory you never want to forget. Here's to laughter and friendship and meandering walks in the park.

I've been thinking a lot about brokenness lately...both the positives and the negatives of it. The place where we come to the end of ourselves and there's nothing left but the raw, tattered edge of what we've been: that's a brokenness that makes us ready to be reshaped and repurposed and refilled. May God allow us to see great and beautiful things around the corner from the broken places we find ourselves in. #redemption #newchances

Some days, you just have to roll in the mud to have life feel complete. We took the girls to Applegate Lake yesterday, and they spent more than an hour having a mud fight. The laughter, the screams, the running and dodging and flopping and splattering...it was beautiful. One of those moments in time that you never want to forget. #dadlife #mudmemories

These kids...they get older and older and I'm struck by how short my time is with them. I love when the day slows enough for face to face time with a young Cosand. Today, the biscuits and gravy were for Eli and me.

A couple of days away with the Mrs. is all awesome and restorative and fun and games and splashy splashy until the second night...when the darkness is shattered by a blood-curdling scream and the two of you feel instantly inspired to collapse the tent, jam it in the trunk, and high tail it out of the woods for the sweet safety of civilization. #dontjudge #youwerentthere #itwasbigfoot #cowardlymaybebutalive

I'm a dad. More specifically, I'm a dad in my mid-40s. The reason that's important is it's the age MY dad was when my first memories begin. This man is a remarkable man. He is generous, harder working than anyone else I know, loving, and the best composer of silly, spontaneous songs in the whole world. I am a fortunate boy to have Allan Bryan Cosand as my father, my example, and my reminder of what love looks like.

We went camping at my Mom and Dad's cabin this past weekend. As I was looking through books, I found this photograph. It's in pretty bad shape...faded and cracked...but it captures a great moment from my childhood. I was 9 years old and we were packing the car to head to Great America for a family vacation. My buddy, Ed, was coming along and I was stoked. It's amazing how seeing a picture can reignite a whole mental album of memories.

My daughter, Abby, graduated high school tonight. It is humbling to be a parent, looking across years of life, and think of the countless moments of joy and struggle and success and challenge. It is also beautiful. I can't imagine what my life would have been like without my children...and I'm grateful I don't have to. #blessed

To end the school year, my third graders have become inventors. Our Recycled Invention Project is all about creatively salvaging and repurposing. We've had grocery bag raincoats, red Solo cup maracas, cereal box guitars, plastic spoon lamps, milk jug bird feeders, and a contraption made of an ice cream tub, rope, and nails that waters three plants at once. It is so incredibly cool to see the delight and excitement with each new presentation. #MakersRock

This is the look of 40 minutes of looking for birthday gifts for one of my daughter's friends. I'm not complaining...merely documenting. There's a point where every shade of nail polish looks exactly the same.

Such a beautiful place to spend an afternoon with my wonderful family. How gracious of my nephew and new niece to plan their wedding day so well.

After finishing a great week of teaching video production to middle schoolers, I'm ready to steal a quiet moment with a pulled pork sammich. #hellodelicious

There are moments when we look at our early selves and think, "Why did I have to be the uber dorky kid who wore three hats?" Then I realize it had to happen in order for me to grow up to be the uber dorky adult I am today. #questionanswered #TBT

An impromptu getaway with my sweet woman makes for a lovely weekend. Hello, San Francisco!

A couple of beautiful ladies dropped by my classroom today. It is Sophie's 6th grade graduation today...a very intense thing for me to see my last elementary Cosand move one step closer to growing up.
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/be6e15031de1621f5ea7066ad5d9ef96/5BE63597/t51.2885-15/e15/10358277_1498200533728063_355158555_n.jpg
A monumental day for the oldest Cosand boy. We're excited to see Isaac graduate this afternoon.

What an amazing way to start our day...a Skype session with Mars rover engineer Matt Heverly. Matt went to school here at Kennedy Elementary and was very generous to give us nearly an hour of his time answering student questions. #curiosity #NASA #JPL #marsrover

Inventing with #makeymakey today. Students are creating drum sets, pianos, and game controllers with pie plates, playdough, and graphite.

I guarantee this was the best Teacher Appreciation Day ever, or I will eat my hat! Wait...thanks to Whitney Kinnaman, I CAN eat my hat! (And it was delicious, too! Thank you, Mrs. Kinnaman!)

Paisley Mae, the porcine superstar, has grown a great deal since being adopted by Farmer Sophie. Like her guardian, she is also quite precocious. Imagine that!

This woman...I am missing her like crazy. I can't wait for her to come home.

I'm pretty certain my daughter's strangeness is starting to rub off on me... Should I be concerned?

It is beautiful how something as simple as potato salad can connect hearts across generations. Today, I made my mom's recipe and it was like hearing her voice each step of the way as I prepared and mixed the ingredients. Tomorrow, my kids will eat it with me at family dinner. I love that food can be so instrumental in such things.

A girl and her piglet... Sophie is officially a 4H girl now that she has Paisley Mae. Part of me fears that this may not end well...

And it begins...a new year of Battle of the Books. It's amazing to see so much enthusiasm about reading great books.

Aftermath of a field trip: jangled nerves and baldness. Wait...the baldness may have been a pre-existing situation.

Starting the day with one of my favorite groups of educators. I love being with my students, but it's nice to have a day away to focus on learning, collaboration, and recharging.

Seeing a 5th grader wearing a World's Greatest Grandpa shirt made me smile. Hearing that he wears it because it used to belong to his grandfather who passed away made me proud of his loving heart. This job of mine holds so many beautiful surprises.

One of our amazing Kennedy families brought all of the teachers sammiches on our first day back in our classrooms. I am so blessed to work with and for so many generous, remarkable people.

Necessity being the mother of invention, I volunteer to be the picket line donut roaster this morning. It's remarkable how a propane heater can revive day-old Krispy Kremes...

It is heartbreaking to watch my students come to my school and know that I'm not going to be able to welcome them into our room.

No matter where you fall politically, please consider calling the Medford School Board and asking them to settle a fair contract.

Considering art... Students are touring the gallery this morning in addition to working on a piece of their own. My goal is for them to be observant learners today and always.

Creating art in Downtown Medford. I love that my class has a partnership with the amazing artists and crew at Rogue Gallery.
