8:36pm I‚Äôm hunkering down for a week of solo writing while missing my family intensely. These pictures will probably keep coming in all week. This is such a classic Louie + Rody face. And a classic Niko sandaled foot as well.

Blueberry danish from scratch, part 2. . I took all the ingredients of a blueberry danish and rolled them back to their closest naturally-occurring animal, plant, or mineral.

This is an interpretation of one of my favorite Alan Watts quotes. . ‚ÄúFor there is a growing apprehension that existence is a rat-race in a trap: living organisms, including people, are merely tubes which put things in at one end and let them out at the other, which both keeps them doing it and in the long run wears them out. So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other. At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow. As and when they get enough to eat, they use up their surplus energy by wiggling in complicated patterns, making all sorts of noises by blowing air in and out of the input hole, and gathering together in groups to fight with other groups. In time, the tubes grow such an abundance of attached appliances that they are hardly recognizable as mere tubes, and they manage to do this in a staggering variety of forms. There is a vague rule not to eat tubes of your own form, but in general there is serious competition as to who is going to be the top type of tube. All this seems marvelously futile, and yet, when you begin to think about it, it begins to be more marvelous than futile.‚Äù . #webcomics #gumtheory #livingthingsareliketubes

Gum Theory: Step 3 of the proof for Blueberry Danish Completeness. . If and when your gum ‚Äúhumans‚Äù, that begins the most crucial stage of your blueberry danish-making process. Gum that ‚Äúhumans‚Äù will begin to stretch and smoosh a lot faster, but will also become a lot more unpredictable. You‚Äôll have to keep a closer eye on things from this point forward. . The good news is that, as long as the humaning gum doesn‚Äôt go bad and destroy itself (yes, some batches will be lost to this, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up too much if it happens to you), blueberry danishes are pretty much guaranteed to happen eventually. . Stay tuned for more #gumtheory...

Gum Theory: Step 2 of the proof for Blueberry Danish Completeness. . This progression is sort of what you‚Äôre looking for, though don‚Äôt become too upset if your world doesn‚Äôt turn out exactly like this. Of your hundred billion-ish danish-friendly planets, you can immediately rule out any that lack ingredients higher up in the chain because they‚Äôll make it a lot less likely that you‚Äôll find workable substitutes. But rest assured, if you keep searching you‚Äôll find a planet with water, good ore, salt, and eventually even life. If you get to that point in a couple billion years, you‚Äôre in good shape. If it takes a bit longer, that‚Äôs okay too. Like I said earlier, patience is key. . The biggest sign that you‚Äôre on the right track is if your gum humans. . Stay tuned... #gumtheory

The proof for Blueberry Danish Completeness starts with a piece of gum, created by Gruth (see Axiom #2). Look at your proto-gum universe closely and you‚Äôll find it has the bare essentials of a delicious blueberry danish: space, time, waves, and particles. Let them expand and sit a while to form galaxies and nebulas and whatnot. If it all looks like hot mush for a while, that‚Äôs okay. Patience is key. As things cool down, most of the particles will be hydrogen (which makes terrible danishes all by themselves), so let them cycle through a few lifetimes as stars. You‚Äôll need some big stars to supernova and fuse enough carbon, oxygen, iron, etc that will be useful later. . Check in on the universe occasionally to see if you have a good mix of light and heavy elements, and also a healthy selection of solar systems that can support blueberry danishes. A hundred billion or so is a good number to aim for since we‚Äôll be whittling a bunch down in the next step. . (Stay tuned for step 2 where we identify a single world with good potential for the remaining ingredients...) #gumtheory
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/92913d0619b12f6670207339e453a229/5BDCCB3C/t51.2885-15/e35/26868308_151079012269261_7893025961531146240_n.jpg
A programming language is ‚ÄúTuring Complete‚Äù if it‚Äôs able to potentially execute any program, even if it would take infinite memory and time. . Blueberry Danish Completeness is a similar test for theories of everything. Can Gum Theory, using the constraints of its own theories and axioms, explain how to make a blueberry danish from scratch? ‚ÄúFrom scratch‚Äù, in this case, doesn‚Äôt mean starting in a kitchen with all the ingredients, but rather starting from the initial conditions of the known universe. . Let‚Äôs give it a try. (To be continued...) #gumtheory

How to respond to any question, whether or not you know the answer: . Step 1: Look for a theory that can answer the question. If you find one, give the theory as the answer. If you don‚Äôt, continue... Step 2: Look for an axiom that can answer the question. If you find one, give the axiom as the answer. If you don‚Äôt, continue... Step 3: Create a placeholder for the answer, attributed to Gruth. Call it a gruthism. Occasionally revisit Step 1 and 2 to see if you can replace the placeholder with a theory or axiom. . Et voila.  See, Gum Theory is much simpler than any other theory of everything, religious, scientific, confection-based or otherwise. #gumtheory

Unlike axioms, theories gotta be falsifiable. To falsify this first theory, find something in the universe that can‚Äôt be made from other things either by smooshing other things together or stretching them apart. . For this theory to hold, you should be able to make a tree out of the right amount of other things. And in turn a tree could be used to make any other thing, like a bicycle, or a black hole. . You may object and say, ‚ÄúBut a bike is made of metal while a tree is made of wood.‚Äù Which is true. But bikes and trees and black holes are made of atoms and even smaller things, all of which are made of gum. With sufficient raw materials, and proper instructions, you can turn wood into steel, or steel into a black hole, or a black hole into a blueberry danish. #gumtheory

In the beginning, there was religion, and it was good. Except for the periodic waves of corruption, hatred, and killing. Then there was science, and it was good. Except even the scientists didn‚Äôt understand what quantum mechanics and string theory really meant, much less know how to explain it to a kid or regular human. We as a world needed something new. A new theory of everything that‚Äôs as easy to ‚Äúget‚Äù as ‚ÄúLet there be light!‚Äù but which can also explain the complexities of the world as accurately as e=mc2. So I thought, why shouldn‚Äôt I take a stab? Right? I‚Äôm gonna call it Gum Theory. Why? Because my placeholder origin story is that a bored god-like entity chewing on a piece of gum blew a bubble, and it floated away. In that bubble is our entire universe, made of gum. It‚Äôs as good an origin story as any, right? The main point being that we don‚Äôt know our origins, and just need a placeholder so we can talk about the rest. The rest of what we talk about is gum theory. Should be quite simple and straight forward, right? #gumtheory

1Ô∏è‚É£üéäüéàüéÇ Louie Phoenix was born one year and four hours ago, and he has made our lives lighter and more joyful in so many ways. He's a happy being to his core. He can say mama, papa, nana, ola, doggie (we don't have a dog, but it's his spirit animal), nnnn! (when he's mad), aa aa aa! (when he's excited), and awa (when he wants to get the weather from Alexa).
