My big little girl, she's so advanced and growing up so fast! She can almost sit up unsupported (albeit with the odd topple), she has 2 teeth with what looks like more coming and she can turn from front to back, and she's only 4 months today! She's also super smiley and adorable, she fills ours hearts with joy and Liam loves her so. #kimgarethbb2

Amazing weather and great food today at Restoran Wonderland Valley in Bukit Tinggi. Perfect driving weather too, I had far too much fun on Karak highway 🚗 - worth the drive.

My Lils, she's growing up so fast! Most people say she looks a lot more like me, not sure that's a good thing? Haha 😂 she's certainly very fair, her skin tone is a lot like mine, very pinky. She's getting very strong and curious too, she loves sitting up and looking around. Not a fan of lying down any more. I think she'll roll over soon. ♥ #kimgarethbb2

Now that's how you cook a steak medium rare, absolutely spectacular 400g grass fed ribeye cooked to perfection by Chef Yusuf. I had to visit the after the multiple posts from @iamikhong @llemongrass and others. It lived up to their promises, it's a very long time since I've had a steak this good in KL, or anywhere in fact. It's a little smokey inside, but other than that, no complaints. #butchercarey #steakhouse #mediumrare

All packed and ready for a 20 hour journey back to KL with the clan. Kids are all healthy again but @kimberzilla isn't feeling 100% 🤮 so it's not going to be the easiest trip. Mom is in the kitchen whipping up our last meal in UK for this trip 🇬🇧 🍳. We've had phenomenal weather and a really enjoyable trip overall. Part of me is glad to be going home to my own bed and shower 🛏 🚿 and part of me is sad to be leaving. Also very excited about starting my new job next week too of course. See you on the other side! ✈ 🇲🇾 #kimgarethbb1 #kimgarethbb2 #liamwithlily

As one door closes another one opens. It's time to end this chapter of my life, a chapter I've spent at an incredible company called Mindvalley transforming thousands of people's lives by delivering World class education products via a complex technical eco-system built by a spectacular team of engineers. It's been an absolute honour to work alongside such an exceptionally high standard of people, I've been pushed into places I never knew anything about (leadership, coaching, lobbying, strategy design and many more) and I've grown immensely both personally and professionally because of that. Lifebook and WildFit were absolute game-changers for me (and Kim) and just being in an environment where personal mastery is the absolute top of mind for everyone, all the time - is something quite special in itself. Plus the wonderful, fun culture, team retreats, beautifully staged parties, inspirational speakers and authors and meeting people like Jon and Missy Butcher. There is much to miss about Mindvalley and the people that make Mindvalley what it is. I need more though, and I can be more, I seek more challenges, a new environment, new things to learn, new people to push me, new things to learn about and to work on a different scale. Thank you @mindvalley, and thank-you @vishen for giving me the chance to thrive and grow in the absolutely amazing environment you have created. If you think you know someone who might be able to replace me, is a cultural fit in Mindvalley, a wonderful engineering manager and deeply technical, please do share this with them: http://careers.mindvalley.com/head-of-engineering #mindvalley #headofengineering #cto #vpengineering #personalgrowth #wildfit #lifebook

Ran into this place called Picnic Table by Simply Sandwiches totally by accident because Crack Pork has closed down 😥 - turned out to be a happy accident with generous portions, tasty and really well priced. I had a wicked combo of grilled cheese beef pastrami sandwich with fried chicken wings and a coffee all for RM25. Really impressed, I will be back! #simplysandwiches #kotadamansara

This little beauty has been giving us a hell of a couple of days with her peeing and pooping, she poopsploded in the car through 3 layers, pooped and peed on the hospital bed when we were weighing her then managed to pee on two of her towels during the SAME bath time, hence her being on one of our old towels in this picture. Who said girls were easier 😂 just because they don't have a directional hose, which honestly is easier to contain than a gushing non-directional waterfall 🤦🏻‍♂️ but you know, I love her anyway 😍 #kimgarethbb2

Somebody is one week old! We've had her at home for quite a few days now and she's been as good as gold, an absolute pleasure (apart from the normal stuff like pooping on me and peeing in her towel right after a bath). Enjoying her so much! Can't wait to have Liam back home and have our little family all together. #kimgarethbb2

So she's here, finally, the first time I get to use the #kimgarethbb2 hashtag! Our beautiful, highly anticipated rainbow baby 🌈 makes our family complete. It didn't really go to plan, as with everything in life, @kimberzilla ended up having to have an emergency C-section as her blood pressure was getting really high and the baby just wasn't descending. All is well tho, Kim is fine and recovering, baby is latching well and seems very healthy at a rather substantial 3.53kg. Quite a day, I think I've clocked 2 hours sleep in the last 48 hours, it all started around 2am last night when we were preparing for bed. Must be even more exhausting for Kim, I'm so proud of her and so so grateful our baby is here safely and everyone is well. Words cannot express our relief. Thanks so much for all the kind wishes, we treasure each and every one 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 💖 #newbornbaby #newborn #babygirl #newborngirl #rainbowbaby

Springbank 9 years old Gaja Barolo, a follow up to one of my favourite drams ever. Bottled at a decadent 54.7% ABV in 2013 with only 11000 bottles. It pours a deep rich mid orange, nose is sweet orange liqueur, full bodied, very oaky, hot but not boozy, very rich, spicy on the finish, a solid dram but not mind-blowing like the 7 year old but still very good. #stwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskysnob #whiskylovers #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #glencairnglass #springbank #springbank9 #springbankgajabarolo #campbeltown

I've gotta say, it's not often I'm blown away by some form of customer service, especially in this region, but wow, I'm super impressed by Western Digital. I could check my warranty status online with the serial number, raise an RMA for a warranty claim, print out a barcode and address and I sent it to Singapore for about RM30. Less than a week later I've received a beautifully packaged brand new looking replacement disk without talking to another human being, my ideal scenario. Kudos Western Digital, job well done. I will be your loyal customer. #customerservice #synology #westerndigital #harddrive #wd40efrx

Auchentoshan Three Wood triple distilled single malt whisky bottled at a reasonable 43% ABV.

So yah, there's this, which we've pretty much managed to keep quiet about for the last 4-5 months. We are expecting a beautiful baby daughter on Feb 22nd (or most likely sometime before, maybe Valentines day?). It's been a pretty stressful time, weekly visits to the hospital, injections, operations, it's been expensive and tiring but so worth it. Kim has basically been on semi bed rest so I've had to pick up the slack. She's more pregnant than she's even been right now and will reach 33 weeks on Thursday (Liam was born at 32 weeks 3 days) so it's looking good so far. Our little bean is growing well and is super active, can't wait to meet her and introduce her to you all. Liam is happy and seems excited, can't wait to see them growing up together. 2018 is going to be the best year of our lives. Happy New Year and thanks for all your love, support, prayers and positive wishes for us, each and every one is appreciated so much and has helped us get here 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👌🏼👣💖🎉 #2018baby #kimgarethbb2 #kimgarethbb1 #expecting #pregnancyphoto

Mostly Liam, which isn't really a surprise as he's definitely the cutest in the family. Also the Coldplay concert in Tokyo, that was quite a trip and glad to see my Standard Chartered 10km there as running has become quite a big part of my life in 2017. It's been quite a year with ups and downs, but it's ending well and I think 2018 is going to be an absolutely incredible year 🎉 Happy New Year everyone 💖 #2017bestnine #2017summary

First pic on my phone from the new camera, got a Sony a6300 with the 16-50mm OSS Kit Lens on Lazada for a really good price. I lost my Canon G7x which served me well to start my VLOG. Now I have 4k capabilities (well on the camera..not my skills haha). I've been thinking about a mirrorless upgrade for a while as my old Nikon D7000 has amazing IQ but is way too heavy and bulky with the lens on. Looking forwards to getting to know it. Impressions so far are it's small, not so light as a compact camera but not far off, high ISO performance is astonishing and video quality is superb. Exciting times! #sonya6300 #a6300 #sonyalpha #kimgarethbb1

Bowmore Tempest Batch 1 bottled at a face melting 55.3% ABV. So strong this single bottle ate through its original cork and a replacement! Pours a bright clean orange, sweet spicy caramel nose with a touch of brine, fruity sweetness and a hint of smoke. In the mouth its massive, rich, fruity, peaty, smokey with an immense lingering finish of salted pears. Absolutely incredible. Mind blowing. Perhaps the best value for money bottle I've ever owned. I wish I had a case. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #scotch #islaywhisky #peatedwhisky #bowmore #bowmoretempest #bowmore10 #caskstrength #glencairnglass #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #whiskysnob #scotchwhisky

Hazelburn 12 Campbeltown Single Malt is bottled at a solid 46% ABV, pours deep rich gold and brings a sweet, rich, woody, dried fruit nose, big in the mouth, full, almost oily, gentle peat, spicy, rich with a dry almost pungent burning finish.

Upgraded from my Phaiser because I'm a sweaty beast and I wrecked them. Grabbed the Jlabs Epic2 mostly by chance as I saw them on Lazada for a wicked deal (RM240 when they retail at USD99). Sound quality is great, massive array of tips and 12 hours per charge which should easily last me a week or even two of running. The cable clips are great too as you can shorten it up behind your neck to reduce or stop cable sounds when you're running and the cable rubs on your neck or shirt. Looking forward to it lasting. #running #newrunner #runningheadphones #jlab #jlabepic2 #wirelessearbuds #runningear #jlabaudio

Glenfiddich 14 Year Old Rich Oak bottled at 40% ABV. Pours a rich deep mid gold, nose is sweet caramel, slightly spicy, taste is bourbon sweetness, toffee, lingering candied finish. Not bad for the price but not exactly challenging. #stwhisky #whiskylovers #whiskysnob #maltmaniacs #glencairnglass #glenfiddich #glenfiddich14 #glenfiddichrichoak #singlemaltwhisky #scotchwhisky

Isle of Arran Machrie Moor, the peated arran malt bottled at 46% ABV. Pours a very pale straw, nose is savory salted caramel, sweet up front in the mouth, smooth, not so smokey, mellow burn with some herbaceous finish.

The Glendronach 15 Year Old Revival has to be one of my favorite all time drams for the money, bottled at a respectable 46% this deep amber delivers a massive sweet toffee caramel nose in the glass. In the mouth it's rich and smooth, leather, tonnes of sherry, wood, clove spice, deliciously deep and complex. Finish has a little spice and a lovely warming richness. Stunning stuff. #stwhisky #singlemaltwhisky #singlemalt #scotchwhisky #whiskylovers #maltmaniacs #glencairnglass #glendronach #glendronach15

Honestly super love my standard navy blue @toms from @tomsmalaysia so I bought a slightly fancier pair earlier this year and in less than 3 months they were totally unwearable. Broken inside and the sole peeling off. Honestly really disappointed and these cost EVEN more than the regular ones which after 10 months of heavy wear are still just fine. #toms #tomsshoes #socialenterprise #tomsmalaysia

The Arran 17, bottled at a reasonable 46% - the real minimum for a tasty dram. A lovely rich gold in the glass, sweet caramel and citrus spice on the nose, full body, big taste bomb, sweet, oak, lingering woody sherry finish. Lovely stuff and great value.

Finally got around to visiting BEAM, even though it's so near our house we've never actually been. I honestly expected it to be pretty mediocre and we probably wouldn't return, but I have to say it totally exceeded our expectations and every item was delicious with generous portions, loads of veges and very fairly priced. All of the pictured items were just over RM80 with a roast chicken panini, mushroom salad, mixed salad, cold brew coffee and 2 cakes. We will go back. #kimgaretheat #beamcafe #beamcoffee #malaysiacoffeeshop

Glenfiddich 18 bottled at 40% ABV is a solid go-to dram, nothing particularly exciting or challenging, but lovely, smooth and drinkable. Pours a rich, bright mid orange, nose is vanilla, spice, orange peel, very inviting, in the mouth its medium light, not much burn at 40%, marzipan, some oak, decent slightly sweet finish. Easy going stuff, I'd personally say Glenfiddich 15 is a bit more complex and represents better value for money. Happy to drink this anytime though. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #glenfiddich #glenfiddich18 #maltmaniacs #whiskysnob #glencairnglass

Aberlour A'bunadh Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky bottled at a stonking 60.1% ABV foe this Batch 49 edition. Pours a dark rich brown with hints of orange, nose is massive sherry sweetness, dried fruits and caramel. In the mouth it's huge, rich, intense, hot, spicy, leathery, definitely benefits from a drop of water. After the addition of water it smooth, sweet, oaky and delicious. One of my all time favourite drams and exemplary good value for money. For sherry heads it's highly recommended. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #sherrycask #aberlour #aberlourabunadh #highlandwhisky #scotchsinglemalt

Ardbeg Corryvreckan an Islay Single Malt bottled at 57.1% ABV. Pours a pale to mid gold in the glass, nose is sweet saline caramel smoke, full smooth body, aggressive, peppery spicy waves of huge flavour, this is a big one, finish is long with black tar and lingering charred wood.

Lagavulin 12 Cask Strength 2011 bottling, bottled at a whopping 57.5% ABV, pours a deep mid gold, nose is sweet caramel with a hint of salt and smoke, big and silky smooth in the mouth, powerful aggressive smokey sweetness, crushed rocks, bacon, candy, lingering rich oily finish, wow, pretty much my favourite Lagavulin and one of my favourite drams. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #peated #lagavulin #lagavulin12 #caskstrength #peatedwhisky #glencairnglass

Another decent option for no meat, Ah Cheng Laksa with extra fish. Quite a lot of veges inside too. I'm starting to question the health of a mostly vegetarian diet as it contains a lot of carbs and has a heavy reliance on tofu which I'm not a big fan of (endocrine disruptor) I kinda prefer paleo. Or a mix of somewhere in between, reductarianism. Definitely gonna continue eating less meat, some fish and loads of veges. #pescetarian #vegetarian #vegan #paleo #ahchenglaksa #laksa

Hazelburn CV a great NAS entry level dram from Campbeltown bottled at a solid 46% ABV and is a perfect introduction to Hazelburn. It pours a rich mid gold, nose is sweet caramel and orange peel, body is full and rich, quite sweet, very clean, spirit warming heat into quite a dry finish. Lovely drop. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #hazelburn #hazelburncv #campbeltownwhisky

Day 4 without meat, avocado and cherry tomatoes on sour dough toast at home for lunch, it's going ok so far. There's no word to capture our diet now, it's kinda paleo (whole foods, no processed, bread must be sprouted or sourdough etc) pescetarian (still eat seafood on occasion yay poke bowls) carnivore (we will eat meat occasionally when it's really worth it, like a cheat day). But really very plant based. If you want to know more watch the new Netflix documentary What The Health and read The China Study. #plantstrong #paleo #pescetarian #avocadotoast #plantbased

Talisker 10 bottled at a generous 45.8% making it great value for money.

Springbank 12 Year Old Cask Strength an absolutely stunning Campbeltown offering, super value for money at 54.6% ABV. Pours a deep rich bronze, nose is  sweet and piney, in the mouth it's aggressive and sharp, goes into smooth sweetness with a hint of vanilla and a strong burn on the way down, finish has a touch of peat and saltiness.

Nikka Coffey Grain a 45% ABV Japanese Grain Whisky. It pours a rich deep gold into orange, nose is sweet marzipan, ripe tropical fruit with a touch of coconut, taste is toffee popcorn with some tropical fruit, finish is sweet fruit but not that lasting.

So here's a picture of an idiot at a Car Rental place, a rejection notice and Lake Yamanaka. We'd rented a car to come to Fuji Area and to visit Hakone Shrine. I went to get the car yesterday morning while @kimberzilla packed to get us out our AirBNB by 11am. I guess I've been spoilt by the 'flexibility' of Malaysia and South East Asia or I've just travelled in Europe too much as the thought that I might need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Japan never even crossed my mind. So the car rental place rejected me, we had to lug our bags to Shinjuku Express Bus Terminal and take a bus here. It was actually relatively stress free, but now we are in a pretty remote place because we thought we'd be driving, it's overcast so we can't even see Mount Fuji and yah, please get an IDP if you want to drive in Japan. #kimgarethjapan #lakeyamanaka #mountfuji #sekimotoya #guesthousesekimotoya #sorhaigwailoh

Amazing Japanese black beef bowl for lunch with sashimi. Worth the queue, they only sell 30 sets a day every lunchtime. Pretty special. #matsurokuya #matsuroku #japanesefood #japaneseblackbeef #kimgarethjapan

What a spectacular show! Amazing stage presence, light show, all kinds of confetti, fire, lasers, balloons and lots of jumping. Plus a bonus new, never heard before song. Tokyo is good to us 💗🇯🇵 #coldplaytokyo2017 #coldplaytokyo #tokyodome #kimgarethjapan

So yah, this happened. Was sitting in a cafe and @kimberzilla  remembered Coldplay was playing in Tokyo tonight, so we searched for tickets. They had some. During my purchase it failed as they 'sold out'. Then I tried again, there were still VIP tickets and the price had gone DOWN. Then my credit card got rejected, so I tried a different card. It worked! Then we went to Kanda Post Office to collect the tickets, and here we are, outside Tokyo Dome with 2x Coldplay VIP tickets for tonight. Thanks Universe, you definitely have our back. #kimgarethjapan #coldplaytokyo #coldplaytokyo2017

Luke's Lobster, wow, blew me away. And great value for money! Get the US size lobster roll, the shrimp roll is really good too, avoid the crab. Some half decent beer too, had a Blue Moon wit. Great meal. #lukeslobster #kimgarethjapan #japanlobster

We've heard some good interwebz chatter about Thai Hou Sek in 1 Utama so we decided to try it out, good to have another porkie option in 1U. The food was overall good, service great, portions generous and priced reasonably. The braised pork belly noodles were my favourite, and the pomelo and bacon salad. Worth a try I reckon. #thaihousek #thaifood #thaistreetfood #1utama #1utamafood

It pours a beautiful mid orange gold, nose is sweet toffee with a hint of salt. Medium body in the mouth, sweet and fruity, dry oak finishing into slightly peppery caramel. Not bad for the price. #stwhisky #blendedwhisky #blendedscotch #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #glencairnglass #grandmacnish #grandmacnish12 #grandmacnishwisky

Glenfarclas 15 bottled at a very solid 46% ABV. My favourite proof for non cask strength whisky. Pours a deep orange brown, sweet ripe fruits on the nose with some booze, vanilla and leather. Good body and big taste, dry oak, vanilla, dark treacle, spices, slightly spicy smoke on the finish. Very balanced. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #glenfarclas #glenfarclas15 #glencairnglass #speysidewhisky #scotchwhisky

Bowmore 17 bottled at a respectable 43% ABV. Pours a light to mid gold with a toffee and smoke nose. Smooth in the mouth, sweet caramel upfront with a good bite and sweet smoke towards the end, great body and long rich dry oaky smokey finish. A well priced dram often found in duty free. Nice. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #peated #bowmore17 #bowmore #islaywhisky #glencairnglass

Bushmills 10 bottled at 40% ABV,  the most prominent of the Irish single malts. Light brownish in the glass, nose is sweet honey with candied fruits and leather, taste is sweet a little tropical mango, a little watery, some chocolate, not much finish.

So yah, this happened. See you there on May 21st. And no I can't even run 1km now so I'm not doing a full marathon haha. I'm also not doing a 5k, because @kimberzilla said that's for little kids. I'll be in the 10km cruise category. Wish me luck! #running  #first10km #runningtraining #scklm #sckl2017 #newrunner #firstrace #couchto5k

Laphroaig Select Cask an Islay single malt bottled at 40% ABV. Not normally a fan of 40% bottlings but this one is a cracker and IMHO one of the best value drams you can pick-up at duty free. Pours a beautiful mid orange and delivers a mellow enticing smoky nose with a backbone of sweet toffee. In the mouth it's not that full bodied but packs plenty of flavour, subdued smokey, pepper spice, dry oak into a lingering finish with a bit of heat. Nice dram. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #peated #laphroaigselectcask #laphroaig #islaywhisky #dutyfreescotch #dutyfreewhisky

Hibiki 17 bottled at 43% ABV, probably the best blended whisky I've ever had. Pours a beautiful deep mid orange, rich delicious oaky honey nose. So smooth in the mouth, sweet up front, costs your mouth with honeyed fruits then into spices and tobacco with a lingering sweetness. Finish is dry and woody. All around so balanced and drinkable. Wish it didn't cost a kidney now, the price of Japanese whisky has gone nuts. #stwhisky #blendedwhisky #hibiki #hibiki17 #japanesewhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #glencairnglass

A must eat for us in Bangkok, T&K seafood at Yaowarat, Chinatown. Best raw prawn salad around. Our massive feast costs us only THB1100! And before that we had a 2 hour massage for only THB600 each (1hr oil, 1 hr Thai). Blissful. #bangkoklife #bangkokchinatown #yaowarat #t&kseafood #seafood

Kavalan Single Malt Whisky, the Taiwanese distillers base expression. Very young, as with all their drams, so no age. Bottled at 40% and had caramel colour hence is quite a deep brown. Harsh boozy nose, some oak, quite rough in the mouth, sweet, dried fruit, oaky finish. Not bad, and not great either. Quite hot. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #taiwanesewhisky #kavalan #kingcar #kavalansinglemalt

Hakushu 12 by Suntory bottled at 43% ABV, what a Japanese single malt with an age? Good luck finding one of those nowadays. A mid gold in the glass, smooth sweet caramel wood nose. Mellow in the mouth, fruity, delicate and light like most Japanese drams. Floral sweet finish with some oak. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #japanesewhisky #japanesesinglemalt #hakushu12 #hakushu #suntorywhisky #glencairnglass

Familiar with these? They are called meeples, from a board game called Carcassonne. A new addiction for us haha, and one of the games that can be played by 2 players, so I can play with my partner in everything @kimberzilla - maybe we'll try Ticket to Ride later.

Smokehead a heavily peated single malt whisky from Islay bottled at 43% ABV by Ian Macleod. Rumoured to be Ardbeg at around 6 years old it's a very pale straw in the glass. Sweet up front on the nose with some iodine and peat. In the mouth it's very smooth, sweet toffee, light spicy smoke, a little wood. But not all that much complexity.

Glengoyne 18 Years Old coming in at 43% ABV. Quite a rich orange brown in the glass, a sweet smooth inviting nose rich with fruit and toffee.

Blairmhor 8 Blended Scotch Whisky. Beautiful clear light gold in the glass, sweet nose with some ripe summer fruit, honey and an oak backbone. This is a blend of around 20 malts, mostly from Speyside. In the mouth it's got good body, a hint of smoke, really sweet with a finish of sticky honey and oak. Not bad for a budget dram. #stwhisky #blendedwhisky #blendedscotch #blairmhor #blairmhor8 #whiskylovers #maltmaniacs #glencairnglass

Happy to report another healthy option available in KL, this time in 1 Utama (a place we frequent). Thank goodness there's something else to eat other than Nandos! I had amazing meatballs with sweet potato mash and veges. I ordered wrongly too as the dish came with sweet basil and potato mash, which I read as basil and sweet potato mash. They changed it for me though with no hassles and no extra charge. I was super impressed! Food was nice too and they have a well stocked organic selection for baking, snacking etc. Definitely will be back. #organicfood #wildfit #wildfitchallenge #paleo #paleodiet #opikaorganic #organicmalaysia #eatclean

So we've been trying out healthy places when we can that support if food choices. We were in Taman Tun so we decided to try Goodness Greens Cafe which touts itself as a 'detox cafe'. Guess how many salad dressings they have without some form of sugar? Yah none. If you don't want sugar (their flagship GoodnessGreen dressing contains industrial mayonnaise which I can almost guarantee is not organic and contains refined sugar) all you can have is plain olive oil. The staff know basically nothing about the food, full ingredients are not listed anywhere and they sell juice (more sugar yay) and refined simple carbs. Not sure exactly what you're supposed to be detoxing from eating there? I'm also pretty sure they buy in the smoked duck and that has sugar in most the time. I have to guess tho, because ya, no ingredients anywhere.. The protein portions were also really small and for somewhere that can't even make their own mayonnaise it's kinda expensive. What a frustrating and disappointing experience. #goodnessgreenscafe #malaysiafood #malaysiapaleo #paleo #paleodiet #paleolife #wildfit #wildfitchallenge #healthyeating #eatclean #healthyeatingmalaysia

And that's it, he's past the line, it's over. POTUS Donald Trump. Never expected I'd see something so plainly ridiculous in my lifetime (after already witnessing Brexit). Wow. I can just hope my beer gets cheaper 😈 #potus2016 #uselections #presidenttrump

Finally got around to trying ChimiChurri in Jaya One. Awesome, love it! And amazing value for money.

Lunch for today, probably the best one yet by @kimberzilla 😍 It does have a little almond flour to make the crepes, but mostly egg. 😇 Filling is left over roast chicken breast from last night with home made mayonnaise, home made cucumber pickles and sliced boiled eggs. Really good, tasty and filling and Paleo/WildFit compliant. #paleo #wildfit #healthyeating #wildfitchallenge #glutenfree #dairyfree #sugarfree #iquitsugar

Bam, my Fitbit game is strong haha, the new Charge 2, both of my Charge HR broke (screen failure then strap bubbling). And I had 2 broken Fitbit Force before that too. Finally this has an interchangeable strap and the build quality of the tracker is amazing, literally nothing on it to break. As long as it keeps charging and the screen works we are good! Will be retiring my Mi Band 2 now. Thanks to my bro @cdulay1 for muling it back - top lad 🍺 #fitbit #fitbitcharge2 #fitnesstracker #wearables #miband2

Glenmorangie 18, another solid go to dram at any time bottled at 43% abv. Always worth picking this one up. A lovely bright mid orange in the glass, nuts toffee and citrus on the nose. Smooth and full in the mouth, creamy oaky dates. Lovely lingering orange peel finish. Solid. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #glenmorangie #glenmorangie18 #sherrycaskwhisky

Back in KL and keeping it healthy (and paleo) at Paleolicious in Taman Sri Bintang (pretty near home). A full paleo menu including breakfast, western food, zoodles, Korean food and even cake. I had a delicious free range chicken and lemongrass burgers with egg buns, cauliflower mash and a side of sweet potato fries. And good value for money too. #klpaleo #wildfit #wildfitchallenge #paleolicious #malaysiapaleo #eatclean #eatgreen

Glencadam 10, one of the only entry level drams bottled at 46% and very reasonably priced. A pale straw gold in the glass. Fruity sweet vanilla nose, slightly floral. Lovely rich and smooth in the mouth, sweet caramel, loads of oak, lingering orange peel with some spices. Delicious. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #glencadam #glencadam10 #glencairnglass

Highland Park 18, an absolute classic for me and one of the best drams you can get easily that had been consistently excellent. Bottled at a respectable 43% it used to represent great value for money too before whisky blew up and HP moved to NAS expressions. Still a phenomenal sip, deep rich orange in the glass with a nose of caramel, vanilla and pure love. Sweet and smooth in the mouth coating it in toffee and fruit with a backbone of wood, long rich finish with raisins and dates. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #highlandpark #highlandpark18 #glencairnglass

Dalmore 12 bottled at 40% abv. Dark brownish in the glass, citrus nose, strong sherry up front in the mouth, oaky, quite rich, leather and cigars.

Matisse 15, a pretty unusual single malt which most people haven't heard of, bottled at 40%. A lovely dark rich orange in the glass, quite a sweet woody nose. Quite watery in the mouth, not much complexity, almost brandy like. Not the best, that's probably why no one had heard of it. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #matisse15 #matissewhisky #glencairnglass

Ardmore Traditional Cask, bottled at a very respectable 46% abv for a NAS bottle. A lovely dark rich orange in the glass, this young peated highlander has some pretty good depth. Spice and fruit on the nose, not as aggressive as an Islay, rich and great value for money. #stwhisky #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #ardmore #ardmoretraditionalcask #peatedwhisky #peatedhighland #glencairnglass

This one was a right nice surprise for me, Indian single malt whisky? Who'd have thunk it? Amrut Fusion coming in at a solid 46% abv (pretty much the minimum for any decent dram). The names come from mixing Indian and Scottish malts. Lovely mid orange, long legs in the glass. Sweet caramel, orange peel, vanilla on the nose. Spicy and zingy in the mouth, good long finish with wood. Very nice. #stwhisky #maltmaniacs #whiskylovers #scotch #amrutwhisky #amrutfusion #singlemalt #singlemaltwhisky #glencairnglass #glencairn

Aberfeldy 12, a Highland single malt from the Dewar's stable. A lovely mid orange, a sweet nose with honey and fruit. Smooth and well balanced, honey, oak and a gentle burn.

Caol Ila 12 years old bottled at a respectable 43%. Pours a very pale straw gold, nose has sweet caramel, fruits, smoke. In the mouth it's smooth, sharp smoke up front.

What an absolutely incredible meal we had last night at DC Restaurant, spectacular food, immaculate service with absolutely top notch ingredients. Best restaurant in Malaysia for me so far. Highly recommended. #finedining #dcrestaurant #ttdi #malaysiafinedining #wagyusteak #kingcrab #foiegras #seaurchin

Been in the mood for spicy delicious malay food lately and nothing really hits the spot better than Sambal Hijau in Kampung Penchala. And yah, the sambal really is good. #sambalhijau #nasicampur #malayfood #malaysianfood #kampungpenchala
