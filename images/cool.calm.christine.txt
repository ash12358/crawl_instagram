Beach day with an amazing book by @nutritiousmovement called "Move Your DNA", I'm not very far in, but so far there are some really great analogies and some super complex ideas made really simple and accessible to understand. Here's to another amazing Dublin summer day too! 😎👌🧠 #movement

Thoracic extension and shoulder mobility go together like Bonnie and Clyde, however once you have good range of motion at the shoulder joint, it's important to *slowly* build strength in that range (I have hurt my shoulders in the past when I've loaded them too much at end range and it takes a good long while to heal.) * I thank my high volume swimming training as a youngster for my shoulder mobility and ability to extend my spine, I kind of took it for granted until I started Yoga, Pilates and Movement and saw how many people struggle in this department. It also genuinely puts the fear into me when I'm at the gym seeing people lift crazy weights with limited shoulder flexion. * If you're doing overhead lifting and struggling with shoulder pain, it may be worth it to check our your thoracic and shoulder mobility first (I'd recommend working with a physical therapist or movement teacher), and focus on mobility, and then slowly get back to the strength training as you explore your new range. But hey, that's just my opinion on the topic, what's yours?

Exploring The Hellfire Club. What a spooky yet beautiful place. I couldn't help feeling really eerie walking around inside those rooms, but simultaneously, as soon as I saw the view over Dublin from the many big windows of the ruins, it immediately felt beautiful. One can't help but wonder about all the crazy stuff that must have happened between those stone walls, apparently to this day there are small Hellfire clubs that join in secret to take part in 'activities' of a questionable nature.

Glendalough in the sun was an unforgettable experience. We walked, we swam in the loch and then sunned ourselves on the sand watching @yeraymb do some sick hand balancing (Check out his profile for some serious handstand and gymnastics inspiration). Wicklow in summer is heaven on earth.

How amazing are the summer flowers in Dublin!? I often walk past people's homes and smell the strong smell of roses and jasmine and lavender. It amazes me that from the cold, harsh wet winters where the stone walls of our homes lay bare, erupt these bursts of colour of intense life and beauty. It's so apparent to me how the seasons are an earthly parallel to all expressions of life. We ebb and flow from from ashes to beauty whether we like it or not. 🌺🌻💖

The ability to hang, use your grip strength and to hold your bodyweight without failing should be one of those skills we all work towards. I practice my grip strength using a vivid imaginary scenario where I'm doing some kind of epic Bond Girl cliff hanger moment. 🧗‍♀️It helps me hold on for that split second longer. Also, no, I didn't perfectly set the pic up, those are a pair of mover's shoes on the floor, can you guess whose they are?

Happy International Yoga Day! After a pretty serious knee injury about a year ago, that left me with a big meniscus tear (which I still have), I knew I needed gentle stretching and strengthening in a heated environment to restore my pain free range. I found @samanthaleedoyle_yoga and @myyogabody and attended her Friday Restore Revive and Relax which helped me to rehab my knee without the surgery everyone was saying I would need. From not being able to kneel, or to lunge or to walk without pain, my body responded to Yoga in many amazing ways. It not only helped the muscles around me knee to calm down but helped to release tensions elsewhere in my body (and mind) I had developed as compensations for my altered gait due to the pain. Together with my reformer Pilates classes, and my trusty foam roller,  I've now got full range, no pain and able to comfortably kneel. Jules and I go once a week to Yoga and never regret the experience. We're always challenged, and always inspired. 💖🙏💖🧘‍♀️💖🌵 #happyinternationalyogaday #namaste #gratitude #internationalyogaday #yoga #headstand

I remember the first time I tried to do this move on the reformer. It was about two years ago with @anniekpilates leading a strong group reformer class. I remember thinking she was asking us to do something impossible. It took a few weeks (doing multiple classes weekly) and then BAM, I was able for it. I remember Annie saying I was getting stronger 💕 Imagine if I had just given up! Imagine I hadn't kept trying... I would have never known the joy of accomplishment, feeling proud of my body and the feeling of celebrating with my peers. 🧘‍♀️🌱💖 #keeptrying #pilateslovers #dublinpilatescrew #superman #alignment #smallgoalstaketime #reformerpilates #plank

It's true isn't it. Attention comes in many shapes and sizes and it's also a two way street. Being on time for a meeting, listening and hearing what people say, making eye contact, picking up on nuances, listening to your gut and honouring your own intuition and ethical code. Its the most wonderful feeling to be heard, we all know it, so why not give others and yourself the attention that is needed. #generosity #selfcare #honour #bekind #listentoyourgut #newmoon

My clients are so cool. One really lovely and special and loyal client Mary.B (a retired physical therapist from the USA) brought me this book to read. It's super humbling to me to know that someone with such knowledge and experience with the human body (and how it moves) comes to my class on a weekly basis and that we can share our joy of movement together in one of its wonderful forms that is Pilates. I can't wait to sink my teeth into this book and learn more from those who came before me and who laid the foundations of the epic road that is body awareness. 💖🌺🧘‍♂️ #Pilates #Feldenkrais #movementtheory #movementmethod #movemore #bewell #spinehealth #sharingtruth

A few of my study props. Who can name some of the bones in this pic? This weekend is my final viva exam for year 2 of 3, we're going to be given a lower body case to solve and treat. (Hint, not all of the bones in this pic are lower body). The thing I love about studying physical therapy is the intense and in depth anatomy and biomechanics knowledge we need to have to have a chance at helping people. Every person is unique and feels different, but beneath the skin, we're all the same. 🌱💀☠💀🌱 #anatomy #physicaltherapy #goniometry #bones #pilates #dublinfitfam

Press restart 👉🚨 with a blast to the senses in the ice cold Irish sea for World Ocean Day ❄❄... just what I needed after I started off my day with a heavy heart after some sad news from a colleague. But... after a walk in the sun, a swim, an ice cream and a good day's work, things are O.K.  The takeaway from this week is that I am surrounded by the most talented and inspiring teachers and movement people here in Ireland. This place really has some spectacular teachers from all corners of the globe, with epic hunger and drive to be the best at what they do, and no matter where they work their magic, they will bring positive change to many people's lives. I'm really so grateful to live here and be a part of this positive energy and learn from such talented thought leaders. 💖🏊‍♂️🧘‍♀️ #ebbandflow #heartfelt #seaswim #icecold #dublinfitfam #dalkeyharbour #worldoceanday #curvygirls

Working on getting my shoulders above my wrists without over arching into my thoracic spine or hyperflexing my shoulders is tough for me. As soon as I go upside down, it feels like my co-ordination gets lost and I struggle to figure out where I am in space, it's the fear element too. Kicking up into a handstand against a wall still eludes me, so hopefully spending time in this position will help my body understand where it needs to go in space eventually. Small goals, small gains, just keep on trying. 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♀️🧘‍♀️💖🌿 #halfuphalfdown #ebbandflow #inversionfear #shoulderalignment #strengthtraining #awarenessbuikding

I made a thing! From pebble treasures I collected on the beach from my and the hub's recent trip to Greystones. I bought the most unreal Teak and Tobacco incense from @pfcandleco when we were in California and needed an incense holder, so I made one from the collected sea stones. It works really well!

Studying and sitting, sitting and studying, it really stiffens me up big time. It's kind of ironic how I'm studying a movement related degree, but by doing so I'm sitting  so much more than usual. My favourite but also most uncomfortable position is lateral flexion  of the spine, bending sideways, we don't do it much in our daily lives, which can make it harder to do as we get older. The old adage, "if you don't use it you lose it" comes to mind. So guys, if you have five minutes, take a bit of time to side stretch today, and when you do, think of me. 🧘‍♀️💖 #sidestretch #lateralflexion #mermaid #pilates #matpilates #physicaltherapy

Oh how true this is. Most of the movement and career goals I have scare me deeply. Studying a physio degree challenges me daily in terms of time management and willpower, and there is the constant internal worry that I'm too old to start again in a new career... The hardest challenge for me in terms of comfort or rather discomfort however is personal legitimacy, how do you get heard and have a voice in this mad loud world? There's always someone who is just waiting to shout louder and interrupt or basically make you feel insignificant without realising how fragile your strength is. Sometimes it feels best to just crawl into a hole  and stay there and limit yourself to the comfort zone, but honestly, what's the worst that can happen if you just go for it and try something that gets your heart beating...don't let anyone kill your oomph, oh and don't surround yourself with douchebags.💓💓💓💓💓 #quote #chickensoupforthesoul #comfort zone #explore #yellow #eternalstudent #instaquote #goals #dontbeadick

Tonight I had grand ideas of training hard but my body just didn't want to co-operate, well at least by my standards it didn't... I did a strong reformer Pilates class and taught a mat class in which I demonstrated most movements, walked to work and back 3kms each way and I'm still a bit annoyed that I didn't make it to #movement class. Weird right? The stillness of the harbour and the clarity it brought me, oh nature you blessing... as if it's something external. When is enough really enough? When will we deem ourselves worthy? How realistic are our expectations of ourselves? I can only speak for myself, but honestly - take some time to walk outside of you're experiencing conflicting internal dialogue and get some perspective. #selfcare #recharge #view #walks #life

Throwback to partying in some dive bar in Joburg, where @mrsgmathers and I hung out again for the first time in years and brewed up a wonderful, meaningful friendship.

Finally, summer, you're here! #yass . I'm enjoying International Pilates day by following one of the core principles... Balance. My own interpretation of it at least after being sick this week with flu and having written my first exams of the season, I feel pretty wiped out. I haven't worked out or really moved since Tuesday, which brings with it a host of not so great thoughts and feelings. But luckily I know that next week brings a new opportunity to reach my personal goals again. #summer #dublin #dalkey #ireland #european #southafricansabroad #park #parklife #chilled #internationalpilatesday #pilates #balance #selfcare

Real friends help their friends get into a proper squat. But seriously, when you're dressed in black, have college all weekend, and you're covering the concept of foot and ankle biomechanics, it's only natural that one should play with balance in a squat with @laelapshound. After my ankle surgery (see posts from back then), I've been struggling with what seems like a medial impingement and a hard block end feel in passive and active #dorsiflexion. I do quite a lot of mobility work under substantial load and yet there hasn't been any major improvement in my dorsiflexion, so I've got some advice from my tutors which will hopefully help! That said, Im still quietly optimistic that it will improve. I've embarked on an interesting and frustrating journey to improve my ankle mobility, which will possibly, one day get me into a beautiful, childlike squat. #goals #movement #squat #simple #ankles #dorsiflexion #kneeflexion #postoperative #mobilitygoals #rehabgoals

From styling it up in California for #altermansatthealtar to jetlag eyes and exhausting cold Irish weather. Chalk and cheese for sure... but in many ways it's good to be back to my Movement family at @we.are.the.greenhouse.project and good to be moving again!

Pilates has been a long and life changing journey for me. From injury (as it is with so many of us who discover the method) it has opened so many doors of discovery both in my body and in my life as a career woman. Thanks to the people who have made it possible for me to pursue my dream and thanks to the divine creator and to evolution for making our bodies so damn interesting and intricate that it has captured my undivided attention so completely. Our bodies are completely amazing. #pilates #pilateslovers #spinehealth

Throwback to duster times at Burning Man circa 2012. I kind of feel like this is where I learned that it's cool to be who you are as a woman/human. Whether you're into sparkles, chains, lace, heels or hitops, whether you're a ballerina or a fire dancer or a gymnast or a bookworm who likes to chill. There is a place for all of us women to shine on this earth no matter what we're into, no matter how we talk or look or how we hold ourselves. There's more than enough hardship out there, so let's lift each other up, even when it's hard. #internationalwomensday #womensinspire #fierce #dance #burningman #fun #iwd #iwd2018

A year ago today I married my super smart, crazy fun and handsome skater husband @juliennel_sa - What an unforgettable day and weekend and buildup it was to the big day. It's been an epic year since then full of changes and challenges and opportunities. This weekend, we've been blessed with snowfall to ring in our anniversary - the only cold feet we've had so far.

Snow day 3 - went for a walk /got blown around by wind outside and hubbins took a snap of me @juliennel_sa - we got home looking like little drowned rats but it was worth it. It's STILL snowing outside , we saw the ocean and it was raging and angry and the wind is so strong too. If this is what Siberia is like then man oh man I don't know how those people survive. #snowga #dublin #snow #yoga

When the weather in Ireland is code red and the outside real feel temp is estimated at -11 - it's safe to say, we're staying indoors for a while. And it was only last week that I saw the hashtag #summeriscoming rear it's hasty little optimistic head. Back off into your wee corner, warm yourself by the fire and bunker down little hashtag, cuz apparently, tomorrow is going to be a freezing cold zinger! #snowday #dublin #dalkey #winterishere

Holding my breath till the snow stops falling.... Oh it's going to be here all week? Well then that's not the best idea. This is a #throwback to Colombia about a million years ago where the sun was warm and the water was glorious.

Is it possible to be ok with your body? To be at peace with your shape and your jiggles and stretch marks and hairs (that apparently should have been plucked or cut) and bitten nails? It's taken me to the tender age of 31 to start enjoying my curvy frame and realise that I'm not the best at beauty maintenance. To get to this point of genuinely accepting and knowing these small things about myself has taken a lot of heartfelt conversations, neutral-ish observation,  acceptance, gratitude, humbling honesty, and support from others to get me here (the journey is never over). I did a photo shoot a year ago with a visual artist where I was confronted by my body. I'm still a bit nervous to look at the pics and see myself as the central focus but perhaps one day I'll be able to look at them all sans judgement. This is one of the pics from the shoot where I just closed my eyes and allowed my body to move and dance and I actually think it looks quite good. #bodypositive #selfcare#ownyourvibe #doyou #move #girlswithcurves #girlswhotrain #selfie #monday

West Coast National Park flowers in South Africa. Sometimes I really really miss living here. My beloved country has been in the news a lot lately, but no matter what's going on politically, it's still the most beautiful place on earth.

I don't actually remember where this was taken - but I think it must be South Africa since I'm wearing sunnies and could afford to get my hair done 😂I'm also pretty sure @werries_87 is the photographer .... either way, Im wearing no make up and smiling like a mad crazy-eyed happy mamma. This is definitely not a posed shot, which I like. We pose and pose and pose and duck face and lip pout and side boob and all the rest while the world is falling apart. I'm definitely a bit obsessed with social media as you can see, but I reckon it's a good idea to take a step back, and realise that in some places in the world there is real chaos and turmoil.  #CapeTown is facing a huge #water crisis... Day zero (when the taps run dry) is scheduled for April 2018. Madness! It seems so cliché and far away until it hits home that we need to seriously give less of a crap about how we look and start caring about plastic, pollution, water and the like otherwise we are properly screwed! #thoughts #poser

There's more than one way to strap a wrist. Pain in end range wrist extension for sportspeople like goalies or throwers can be tough. Using strapping and taping can assist on the field. The research behind taping and strapping isn't the best but it's still  an interesting topic even if one just looks at the percieved psychological benefits. #sunday #student #college #physicaltherapy

I'm quite proud of this half handstand. It's a work in progress, not only in strength but also in fear and overcoming it. I was never one of those kids who did handstands against the wall - I was a swimmer and basically only focussed on that and nothing else. The idea of going upside down on land is scary for me. When I saw this pic I couldn't believe it was me even though it's simple compared to the amazing feats of human performance seen daily here on insta. Yes, yes comparison takes the spice out of life but who can  honestly ignore it? So - my shoulders are still stiff from this day of training but tomorrow I will be back against that wall. #halfhandstand #proud #goals #overcome #thoracicmobility #shoulders  #yoga #Pilates

I was supposed to go to a workshop today at @yogadublin with Joe Devlin... when on the way there trekking on public transport from Dalkey just by Dartmouth square I saw this dog... whose name I later found out is Elmo... walking alone in the road looking a bit lost. He came straight up to me and didn't leave my side. I tried calling his owner as he luckily had a collar with info on it but it kept going to voice mail and so I tried the SPCA who are only open Monday to Friday? (I'm not sure if I was calling the right people). Anyway eventually after letting him walk ahead to see if he would find his own way home (this didn't work either as he was so friendly he kept on just bounding back to me as if we were on some great big team adventure). 30 mins later the owner called overjoyed that I had found him and came to fetch him. So happy it ended well. Isn't it strange how I was in the right place at the right time for Elmo? Make sure your pets have a contact number on their collars at all times for in case they decide to go on a Sunday adventure. #sunday #pooch #doggo #pets #fate #happilyreunited

Dreaming of the sun and the sea and this sunset on the day we got engaged on Queen's Beach in Cape Town. From Dublin, were praying for the water situation back home. The news has said it could be the first place on earth that is evacuated due to water literally running out. Really really heartbreaking. #capetown #sunset #waterrestrictions

Ahhhhhh finally time to chill at home with two glorious things.... Bed and Boo. Thanks to @juliennel_sa and the famdam for the support over these last few maddening weeks of study over Christmas. It was tough, but here's to being half way through my 3 year Physical therapy B.Sc and to a mini break from lectures before we dive straight back in. Thinking of using this time off to make another macrame wall piece like the one above our bed I made last year. #physicaltherapy #physio #hubby  #colours #macrame #pilates #support #boo #home

Holy shit. This really is the best coffee I've ever had in Dublin. @ebbflowcoffee you guys fucking nailed it! I'd drunk half already so you can see I actually tasted it and I'm not just talking crap. It was so good. Apparently they use different beans every month so get there now cuz whatever they're using at the moment is freshhh! Also, the avo on toast is generous and delicious. #coffee #brunch #avocadotoast

The height of arrogance and lack of self awareness in my opinion. Have enough decency to let people speak. Listen to them and dont assume you know what theyre about to say. This happens to me all the time and I think it's because I'm an observer. It takes me time to formulate a sentence because I don't want to use words unnecessarily. The same issue can be said with giving people adequate attention when they speak. It's usually the quieter ones that have the most insightful things to say anyway. I'm guilty of this too so I'm saying this to myself as well. #dontinterruptpeople #wordsareweapons #controlyourmouth #befuckingdecent

After watching the documentary about George Harrison 'living in a material world' I'm so goddam inspired - He was (is) as much a sage as Rumi (in my opinion). All are welcome aboard the ship to eternity. Ours is not a caravan of despair. Beware of Sadness it is not what you're here for. #rumi #harrison #allarewelcome #inclusion #equality #sage #truth #beinclusive #eliteillusion

Love this little design. And made me genuinely ask myself, am I brainwashed? If so, how? By the new trends in activewear and the sleepless surge towards the perfect body, food source, friendships, family, events, charity, political ideals, exercise or interior design .... Have you taken advice from someone you admire and turned it into absolute truth? It's so hard these days to know what's best for us as individuals unless we feel and experience things for ourselves. The Internet is so full of opinions and people selling ideas. How do we genuinely know what's genuine? I don't have the answer and I'm starting to think we just have to research things ourselves with as little bias as possible and even then - be aware of whose funding the papers and info you read...So far - I'm trusting my intuition going with my gut and learning to live with less stuff and more experiences. What do you think? #brainwashedsociety #opinions #wheresyourheadat #livewithless

A.B.C.D vitamins for when you're in need of a little booster. Changing seasons and moving into the last few months of rush before Christmas means (at least in our home) that sometimes a few vitamin supplements are in order. We take - A - for our eyesight (were both studying and spending long hours reading) and for skin health. - B - for steely nerves - C - for immune protection against all the flu out there - D - its sunshine in a bottle. #vitamins #supplements #adulting #vitalife #abc #lifehack #winteriscoming

Book of insects I found in the library. Not too sure I like the idea... it's beautiful but I hope they weren't captured just for the book.

The Mostar Old City bridge in Bosnia Herzegovina. Dividing Muslim East and Christian West (more of a political border than actually dividing people - according to our guide, all religions live here together in harmony, wohoo!!) Built in 14th century comissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent who ruled the area during the Ottoman Empire. The bridge stood until it was bombed during the war that split the 6 territories of old Yugosavia in the 90's. It was then rebuilt from what they found in the Neretva river that flows below. What the couldn't recover, they built from new stone to resemble the old original. What amazing history this region has!!! #balkanhistory #BosniaHerzegovina #dobardan #mostar #balkantravel With @juliennel_sa

Different is good. Unique is interesting. It's not just about outward appearance because every seemingly edgy or trendy 'look' is so accessible to any budget these days (even punk rocker or skater or barbie or whatever) the only thing that can really set you apart is by being yourself. That's my holiday lesson so far - with the guidance of hubbo @juliennel_sa #braveisbetter #quirksareperks #flauntyourfabulosity #comparisonsarecrap #selfdoubtisadouche #wereallinthistogether

David and Goliath - such a cool sculpture. Gives the viewer the perspective of David as he must have looked up onto Goliath's face.

Life made - tonight @juliennel_sa and I saw @greenday and @rancid at the most epic venue. It was pissing with rain but no one minded. It's the first gig I've cried at with joy and elation from hearing all the oldies and they played such a cool Operation Ivy cover too. My 14 year old me would be proud of 31 year old me. Both bands sounded so so good live not to mention it was an outdoor venue. #dublin #greenday #rancid #lifemade
