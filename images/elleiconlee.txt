I had a great time interviewing the CEO of Thomas Cook - Peter Fankhauser. He was in Shanghai to officially sign the deal with Dream East to develop its first resort in China, to be open in 2020. (Swipe left to see more images...) . . While this resort (1.5hr drive from Shanghai) will be a heaven for families with a lot of family and children friendly facilities; I am more excited to see when they will open their Casa Cook hotels in Asia... . . Peter is a true jetsetter but he has never been to Australia or New Zealand?! . His most desired travel destination is this tiny atoll above the Maldives...super isolated and secretive... . . . And when it comes to the essentials to bring for travelling; his top 3 is smartphone, charger and running shoes/swim trunks! #elleiconleeworks #EmeetstheICONs

Happy birthday, my beautiful mermaid friend. 🧜‍♀️ . . . Being 30 might sound scary at first but it is REALLY the most beautiful age, I feel for the very first time that I am in control of my life and not afraid to go do what I want without worrying so much about what others have to think or say! Enjoy it!!! 💙

It’s true - “The end is just another beginning.” . . I discovered my hidden talent as a TABLE CURLING master after crossing the finishing line at today’s #CKPRUN2018.

I am sorry that I look gross here but I just finished 6km #CKPRUN2018 and feeling GOOD! This is NOT my trophy 🏆, I only received a finish medal 🏅but I shall remember this glorious day as it’s my FIRST EVER group run, and it’s not easy to finish in the super hot and humid #HongKong weather; especially with those turns and uphills...but so many people joined to raise money for @savethechildrenhk @savethechildren and I am so glad to be part of it. Maybe...one day...I will achieve one of these shiny trophies...until then, congratulations to the champions today!!! Well deserved indeed!!! +++ And a big THANK YOU to @calvinklein for hosting such a meaning event! #CalvinKleinPerformance

不經冬寒，怎知春暖。 夏至已過，小心蚊子。 歌賦詩韻，擒手就來。 誇誇自己，真是搞笑。 . . . Just came up with this Chinese “poem”, I am too funny. 🤣 It basically translates as such: You will not know it’s the summer heat if you have never experienced the winter coldness. It’s officially summer now so be careful of the mosquitos. Let it be music, poetry, literacy or 🤷🏻‍♀️; I am good at them all. Complimenting myself like this, I am so shameless. (Ok...trust me, it rhymes in Chinese!!! 💁🏻) Have a happy weekend!!! Be silly, be joyful and bring smiles to everyone around you. ❤️

Me: I used to have your poster on my wall. #LeeHom: Used to? What about now?...😅 (swipe left to see) Was not expecting that kiss between LeeHom and Jackie Chan but...it’s always lovely to see some bromance?! 😍 Since 1995...it’s been a long time and LeeHom is still bringing quality music to everyone. Also, soon to be father to 3 kids! 從《情敵貝多芬》，《公轉自轉》，《不可能錯過你》就開始喜歡上了“超級優質偶像”王力宏。其實我覺得他更是一個音樂家，一個精通古今中外，第一個將中國元素和西方流行完美結合的一個奇才。 作爲4歲也開始摸琴，而現在已經很少彈的人，真的很佩服他一路對音樂的熱情，除了他的天份，還有他堅持不懈的努力。相信學過樂器的人都明白我說的。。。 這次去他的演唱會，他一直宣揚的都是不要“自私族”，大愛，小愛，無敵的正能量。很開心看到那麽多支持他，支持“愛”的歌迷在一起唱他的歌。 而在之後的慶功宴，他每一個人都來打招呼，感謝。他的家人也都在，包括他准備要生第三個孩子的妻子。❤️ 我想他最大的幸福，就是，家人的支持和理解吧。從他剛出道，到現在要做三個孩子的爸爸了。。。時間真的和風一樣，一掃即過。。。 😅告訴你們我們對話中的一段搞笑點，我：我以前家裏都是你的海報和CD呢！力宏：什麽？以前？那現在呢？😲我：（完全沒准備好接這招）我。。。家現在在裝修。。。（這點是真的！）🤐 力宏接著還有好多好多的演唱會，希望大家都能支持，讓我們把更多美好的愛宣揚出去！#王力宏龍的傳人2060

Cube houses (Dutch: Kubuswoningen) are a set of innovative houses built in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, designed by architect Piet Blom and based on the concept of "living as an urban roof". . . Blom tilted the cube of a conventional house 45 degrees, and rested it upon a hexagon-shaped pylon. His design represents a village within a city, where each house represents a tree, and all the houses together, a forest. The central idea of the cube houses around the world is mainly optimising the space, as a house, to a better distribution of the rooms inside. Every cube house has 4 floors, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 huge living room+ kitchen + much storage space. I was only able to admire from the outside last time in Rotterdam since I was traveling solo. This time, I brought my parents with me so I booked a whole house to have this truly unique experience. . . However, I don’t recommend staying here if you are travelling with toddlers or elderlies since there are a lot of narrow stairs to climb. Otherwise, it’s a must-try in Rotterdam! #elleiconleeineu #elleiconleetravels #Rotterdam

There is no literature without a Café – stated Sándor Márai, a Hungarian writer from the 20th century, who himself frequently visited the historical building of New York Café to get inspiration. . . It might be a touristy thing to do to have breakfast at this MOST BEAUTIFUL CAFE IN THE WORLD but no one can deny that it is truly a beautiful experience (minus the SERVICE part). . . Go there before 9am to avoid the waiting, average waiting time is 45mins otherwise. . . The options are either the full breakfast buffet or the à la carte menu, yet only breakfast food is served. . . I strongly recommend trying the national drink - Hungarian coffee & cake. . Immerse yourself into history dining at this 120 years old building with classical live music performance daily. #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeineu #Budapest

Mum loves my latest #MeituT8s!!! #Nofilter . . So I gave it to her as Mother’s Day gift! ☺️ . Its front Sony lens is quite something, and I love how it can share instantly with my other smartphones w/ different operating systems. Are you making your mum happy and pretty on Mother’s Day? 😜 Isn’t there a saying? Happy mum, happy everyone?! . 不用修圖，即刻電影大片海報效果。媽媽太愛美圖T8s，所以母親節的禮物就這麼簡單的決定了。只要媽媽快樂，整個家庭就很快樂咯。這個秘密，你知道嗎？！ 我個人很愛它新的分享功能、再也不用擔心和大家用的手機系統不一樣而不能一秒分享咯。

“All aboard!” - Let’s explore Oslo, Norway the old fashioned way; hitting all the touristy spots by foot. . . Can’t miss the Viking Ship Museum...but I would highly recommend the one (VASA museum) in Stockholm than this one in Oslo. The Vasa museum is super impressive with HUGE vessels and multi-media integration!!! The Viking ship museum in Oslo is super tiny with no special innovative ways to showcase extraordinary Viking history. . . #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeineu #Oslo #Norway #Scandinavia #Vikingship #Vikings

Of course, ate loads of cheese, frites and my FAVOURITE - RAW #HERRING sandwich with freshly diced onions and pickles!!! 😍 . #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeineu #amsterdam

“Heaven above, Suzhou and Hangzhou on earth.” - it’s a famous saying in China that fully explains how beautiful and heavenly Suzhou is. Only an hour away from the fast paced global metropolitan, Shanghai. . . Suzhou is the place to find peace and a great deal of the traditional beauty of China. I would highly recommend this house (20,000sf) situated in the centre of Suzhou to anyone who’s just visiting or wanting to have a place to slow down. . . Every room is equipped with a private bathroom, suites for families are available too. We are also building playroom, yoga room, tea room, calligraphy room,entertainment room and meeting room etc. . . Book it now or save it for later. Can’t wait to welcome you all. 😊 . . RATE starts from 80USD... Link in my profile... #airbnb #homestay #China #Jiangsu #Suzhou #travel #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinChina

I had a great time hosting @lindbergeyewear’s Shanghai flagship store opening ceremony tonight with special guest @godfreygao. REMINDER to myself: wear high heels when next to Godfrey (193cm) because he’s extremely tall...for real!!! 😬 . I don’t wear high heels much because usually I’d end up taller than the male guest...but in this case...I think I will still be shorter than Godfrey...even if I put on my craziest heels...😲 #EmeetstheICONs

Checked into this super sleek new hotel in Wanchai which only opened last year - The Emperor Hotel Hong Kong. Every room has an open view and the limited space is felt more spacious and comfortable using a mix of wood, light, metal and layering techniques. 🙌🏻 . Currently it’s also the home to many professional international rugby players. 🤾🏾‍♂️🤾🏾‍♂️🤾🏿‍♂️🤾🏿‍♂️🤾🏼‍♂️🤾🏻‍♂️ #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinhk

Never underestimate the importance of having a person in your life who can always makes you smile...and...how sometimes that person could also make you want to strangle him. 🤣🤣🤣 #friendship . 在生活中，有些朋友就是很容易讓你大笑讓你開心。但同時，他們讓你翻白眼的機率也可以是高得可怕。

Definitely not the best photo I have taken with someone, but I am here to tell a story. Not many know but I had a hip hop/rap phrase when I was a teenager. @iammcjin was someone I followed faithfully. Starting from Friday Style Friday in 2001, his first song “Learn Chinese” with Ruff Ryders... ... He was the guy who showed the world that rapping is also something Chinese can do...WELL! He’s also the guy who stopped me from perusing a rapping career because I realised how elementary I was. 🤣🤣🤣 So much respect for this guy, he’s still humble and keeping it true to himself; doing what he loves and making a world a better place! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 #fromthebottomofmyheart . . P.S He doesn’t just rap fast, his hands are FLY as well. Proof 💁🏻 . #iamafan

What’s the meaning of art, some might ask. For me, art makes me think... Artists use their unique ways to express certain emotions, raise awareness for critical issues... . Seeing these jelly fish makes me think about all the plastic waste in the ocean...it’s time to act or never...we only have ONE EARTH. #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinhk #artcentral

Can you tell how excited I am to be back in Niseko again?!!! 😆 And this time, thanks to @island_wake; I am staying at the iconic @kiniseko right in the heart of the mountain. . From one bedroom condo to the ultimate penthouse, every room is equipped with a kitchen and a spacious living room. . There are free private and public onsen for the in-house guests and the food here is top notch too! . Free Japanese activity everyday, such as sake tasting and taiko classes. . Nonetheless to say, the staff and the service they offer is just INCREDIBLE.

I thought in 2017...I will travel less in 2018... But so far...14 flights made already and it’s not even mid-March. 🤣 Another 6 flights booked for the remaining of March...✈️ . 2017的時候我想2018要飛少一些，結果3月結束前，最少要飛20次。。。「計畫不如變化」 #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinchina

So proud of my dad! 30 years ago, he was on a battle ship fighting/protecting Chinese sea territory for us. . Though I didn’t think I had a dad back then as he was never around...not even when I was born... . But hey, one’s country always comes first...especially in a family where 4 members are all respected veterans. 🇨🇳

Happy International Women’s Day! Beauty comes in different shapes, sizes, looks, colours and most importantly; it comes from within. We, as women should celebrate what we have achieved so far. And not let others tell us how to be beautiful and strong. We wear makeup, dresses or anything we want because that’s how we feel. However, no one can say we are anything less if we only want to be casual and drive tractors sometimes. 💪🏻💪🏼💪🏽💪🏾💪🏿 #womenpower #happyinternationalwomensday #girlboss #ladyboss #womanboss . . 穿裙子還是愛化妝，我們自己說了算。不要讓別人決定你的美醜，女人要自強。就算今天我不打扮，只想開拖拉機，又怎麼樣？！ 最重要的，我們要記得，美麗由心開始。希望所有的女人都能帶著大愛小愛，將世界打造成一個更和諧平等的地方。

Birthday photo: Sisters ❤️ + 🐨! I arranged a special birthday trip for my sister’s 19th today. We went to different sanctuaries; had loads of fun learning, feeding, petting or just looking at local animals such as koalas, wallabies, kangaroos, little penguins, sheep, dingos etc. Most of our expenses would go on helping the animals for a better future. 🇦🇺🤗

#Melbourne is the city that can fulfil all of your coffee needs! Coconut milk, soy milk, almond milk, lactose free milk? They got them all but NOT HERE at Market Lane Coffee. They believe coffee is served in a certain way with certain ingredients that shall not be altered.

I love surprises! Didn’t make any specific plans or done any research for this Australia trip but ended up at the first @ultra musical festival in this nation. . The VVIP experience was superb!

急急忙忙趕回香港參加一個充滿「愛」與「花」的活動：PAPRIKA在海港城LCX開幕新店啦！並且推出情人節期間限定禮盒──「The Secret Garden」，真皮手袋被滿滿的人手製造乾花包圍，好似已經可以見到情人節收到禮物的女孩臉上的無敵笑容了！ . 其實手巧的還可以將這些乾花製作成花環，手工師說keep幾年都無問題。 我還發現有紅色絲絨限量版，情人節+中國新年一次搞定。 (秘密：細size手袋內有乾坤，可以擺到手機，充電器，唇膏，粉餅+細銀包！） . Back in Hong Kong to attend the opening of the latest store opening of PAPRIKA in LCX, Harbour City. Valentine’s Day and Chinese New Year are both approaching fast and PAPRIKA has launched “The Secret Garden” Collection, and the limited velvet edition. . The Secret Garden Collection is perfect as a gift since the leather handbag is flooded by romantic dried flowers. You can easily make a dreamy headpiece using those dried flowers and keep it for years! . (Surprise: the handbag seems small but it could fit an iPhone, a portable charger, a lipstick, a compact powder and even a small wallet!) . #paprikaspicesgarden #paprikahkofficial #28garden #giftforher #Valentinesdaywish #giftideas #hkflorist #crossbodybag #limitededition #bag #handbag #leatherbag #leathercrossbodybag

PICK ME UP and take me home with you!!!!!! 💖 That’s if you see a “piece” of me at @schiphol airport in Amsterdam now! . It was such a fun experience exploring the airport and finding unique spots that can’t be found elsewhere. .

The FIRST...and ONLY time I got married...was filming ON SET with this guy @vincentwong07 and he’s won the award that he mostly deserves - Best Actor Of The Year! Congratulations, Vincent!!! I am sure you will achieve much much more in the future because you have worked so hard!!! 🙌🏼 . 恭喜王浩信Vincent成為今年視帝，你這麼多年的努力是大家有目共睹的。很幸運第一次拍戲，第一次「結婚」都受到你照顧。希望你越來越好！

It’s really coming down!!! Snowing in Shanghai, it’s going to be a superb year!!! (In China, we think the heavier the snow the greater the year will be!) 瑞雪兆豐年！上海竟然下大雪了。

It’s hard to say goodbye and farewell doesn’t mean forever. In Chinese we say:” See you.” And this is what I also prefer. . 2018 is a big year for me with a lot of new projects happening in mainland China, hence I will move my base to my hometown - Shanghai. . We moved to Hong Kong when I was still a toddler and we welcomed the birth of my little sister in this amazing place. . Hong Kong will always be #HomeKong to me. ❤️ #elleiconleetravels

Popped by the launch of STYLE MAGAZINE CHINA at the historical Paramount Palace in Shanghai last night. . A place full of glam and grand memories, also where my senior family members dated and danced. . The Paramount is a historical nightclub and dance hall at 218 Yuyuan Road in Jing'an, Shanghai, China. It was the largest ballroom in Shanghai before the People's Liberation Army established control over the city in 1949. #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinChina #elleiconleeinsh

Back in Hong Kong for 2 days and then off to Shanghai for more. ✌🏼 . 4 cities (Sapporo, Niseko, Hong Kong, Shanghai), 13 days into 2018...don’t think I will (nor want to) beat my record of 3 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong) in 21 hours in 2017. . 2018 will be a challenging year for me (I have decided to make some major changes in life.), and there will be times like this where my hair is unruly, and things might get crazy. But I hope I will always remember to keep SMILING like this 😁 AIN’T NOTHING BUT A THING... #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinhk . #微笑 #笑

I want to go #snowboarding with @islandwakecrew @jliiplam @joanneliu_x @sharonnn_li @yan44 @angelaywei @nissa.tang ❤️ . @kiniseko is a lovely ski-in-out boutique hotel in Niseko and @gosnowniseko is where I have been taking lessons every time in #Niseko! ❄️ . No matter who wins, I hope she/he will enjoy this brilliant gift. Such a killer combo! 🙌🏼 I hope I can win...because I know I will enjoy this to the MAX! 😝

Introducing to you my favourite deli/cafe in Niseko - An Deli. I come here everyday for lunch or a coffee break. It’s super cozy and I LOVE LOVE their bento 🍱 ! It’s different everyday! Also, their pulled pork burger is delicious as well. So are the cookies and...basically EVERYTHING! Toru and Matt are the faces I see everyday for the past 7 days. They already remember what I usually order (on the 3rd day) and how I prefer soya milk in my coffee/Chai Latte if I am not having black or espresso. . An Deli displays local artists’ work and organise meet-ups too. . Needless to say, WiFi included. ❤️ (SWIPE LEFT TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS LIKE INSIDE AND OUT.) #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinjapan #Niseko

Check this out - the cutest #snowboard ever! . Mad Magazine Alfred E. Neuman x Burton Deep Thinker!!! . It was love at first sight but the consultant told me it’s for more aggressive riders...so...my friend who’s more of a pro ended up buying it. Well, at least he let me take a photo with it. ☺️ . #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinjapan #Burton #MadMagazine #snowboard #Niseko

Saying hello to you all from Niseko, Hokkaido Japan. It’s getting dark here so I better finish this last run...but first...#selfietime! 😆🤳 . Brought some stardust to the slopes today and everyone seemed to like it. 😆 . Thanks to a “GOOD” friend, tricked me into going on a BLACK slope...luckily I survived...fell multiple times in all different ways, I think my 2018 will only get better! 💁🏻⛄️ #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinjapan #elleiconleeworkouts #Niseko #Japan #snowboarder

It was my FIRST time skiing in Asia last winter, and ended up trying to take on snowboarding for the very FIRST time too. Absolutely LOVED it, so I am going back to #Niseko again this winter 1-8 January. Anyone else? #elleiconleetravels #elleiconleeinjapan #yotei

Happy Winter Solstice! Have some glutinous rice balls today...or dumplings...or both...to celebrate! 🎉 And stay warm! (My favourite is always the glutinous rice balls with runny sesame stuffing.🤤) . 今天冬至啦，你們喜歡吃湯圓還是餃子慶祝？我自己比較喜歡芝麻湯圓，冬天真的到啦，大家注意保暖喔。

Mentality of the day- “If you do the right thing, the right thing will come to you.” 😉 . Winter is the perfect time to do #HotYoga! I also added one more #HIIT session today to get myself ready for #snowboarding #ski season! . I did #GUASHA few days ago to cure my illness and it worked like a charm...take on some mild exercises like #yoga when you are not feeling too strong and slowly get back into the high intensity and weight lifting workouts when feeling better. 🏋️ #elleiconleeworkouts #NoPainNoGain #neverstoptraining

Are you looking forward to Christmas? 🎄 It’s the season of giving and receiving... . We might not all receive but we are all capable to give...give some...whether it’s showing someone the direction, giving someone a helping hand, donating to charities or wrapping a gift for your doorman etc. Give and enjoy! . 聖誕節快到啦，你就慶祝嗎？我們家其實不太慶祝，畢竟中國人更重視中國新年。但是在這個大家都互相送禮，收禮的節慶時節。我更喜歡給予，你不一定能要求得到什麼，但你永遠都有能力去給予一些需要幫助的人一些正能量。 給予不分多少，你可以幫陌生人開門，可以幫人指路，可以捐贈慈善機構，或者給門衛包個巧克力等等。 給予讓人快樂！（至少讓我很快樂😉）

I woke up like this...👀 . Ok not always...wasn’t feeling very well due to the sudden temperature drop in Hong Kong so I went for a #GUASHA (A kind of Chinese medical treatment in which the skin is scraped to produce light bruising. In Chinese culture, we believe GUA SHA/scraping releases unhealthy elements from injured areas and stimulates blood flow and healing.) I know it might seem scary but it didn’t hurt, a bit itching for me to be honest. And one can tell how healthy/unhealthy one is from the colour of the bruises...in my case...not too bad but definitely not too well. 😬 The bruises somehow look very artistic and remind me of tribal tattoo, what do you reckon? Want to give it a try too? . 這次刮痧出來的樣子竟然覺得很有藝術氣息，所以紀錄一下。其實刮痧真的不疼啊親，有點癢倒是真的。 #刮痧 #中醫 #elleiconleeloves #Chinesemedicine #medicaltreatment

From @1843mag: When David LaChapelle, an American photographer, retreated from Los Angeles to an eco-farm on Maui, it marked a turning point in his career. LaChapelle, who had made his name shooting decadent advertising campaigns and fashion stories for Vogue and Rolling Stone, embraced fine-art photography and rejected materialism, in life as well as in his work. The “Aristocracy” series is a trio of images depicting private jets spiralling out of control amid clouds. This gorgeous swipe at the jet-setting classes belies the work that went into making this scene: models of private jets were submerged in tanks filled with water. . #elleiconleeloves #davidlachapelle

Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it. . 何謂人生？10%是發生在我們生命中的事件，90%是我們應對的方式。

We can forgive but we shall never forget...today, 80 years ago...13th December...the starting day of the NANKING MASSACRE...300,000 (raped, tortured, murdered) dead...in 6 weeks. . I hope nothing like this will ever happen again...we want to be stronger to be able to protect ourselves, to help others but never to bully, invade or kill...#alllivesmatter #livesmatter #NankingMassacre. . 很難想像80年前的今天，南京迎來了前所未有的痛苦。1937年的今天，南京大屠殺開始。6個星期內，至少30萬平民和戰俘被殘酷殺害，至少2萬女性被強姦。 我不相信復仇，只希望我們不要忘記歷史。想要變強的，不是為了去欺負他人，只是可以保護自己，幫助他人。這樣的大屠殺歷史，不要再發生了，生命並無貴賤之分。#南京大屠殺

Watched this movie on my way to Hong Kong from Beijing just now...I don’t watch much Chinese movies or drama as I didn’t grow up in China but apparently this is one movie that EVERY CHINESE watched...（1 BILLION USD box office) So I watched...and yes it is exactly what I thought it would be... You would feel so much pride being a Chinese...anyways...I don’t want to talk much politics here...I cried a lot...luckily no one was sitting next to me...😐#wolfwarrior #戰狼

Finally! My MCM MTO (made-to-order) bag is here. I picked pink and black leather with silver hardware; I think the bag is easy to carry with any types of outfits. Remember you can also design your own at the MCM IFC and Harbour City popup store until early Jan 2018. #mcmworldwide @mcmworldwide #buzzagency @buzz.agency #elleiconleeloves #ellelee #elleiconlee #李文煊

Aaron Kwok looking dapper. My heart was racing because I used to have his posters on my wall when I was little. 😝 He’s a singer, actor, dancer, racer, a legend and a GENTLEMAN. (He was looking after me as I was in heels. 😳) . 兒時偶像還是個紳士，看我腳踩高跟，就一直幫我看著，護著。臉紅心跳的我，儘量抑制自己快跳出嘴的小心臟。 #EmeetstheICONs

The winners of #CosmoprofAsia Beauty Awards 2017 were announced and awarded today. I was lucky to be there to witness and share the joy of those well deserved brands. Here are some highlights: (1) - Best SKINCARE award: PLABIO Co., Ltd (Korea) PLABEAU, the world’s first rechargeable and portable plasma emitting skin care device, it improves skin conditions through emitting plasma ions, which optimally sterilizes, regenerates, and moisturizes the human skin. This process in effect alleviates skin troubles, revitalizes and erases blatant wrinkles, and provides a whitening and glowing effect on the skin. . . (2, 3) - Best BEAUTY Award, Best NATURAL & ORGANIC Award: Gelle Freres France (France) Eau De Parfum Encapsulated Queen Next Door . Made from the « savoir-fleur » of the Gellé Frères, the range Queen Next Door comes from five delicate flowers: the Rose, the Lily flower, the Orange Blossom, the Magnolia and the Ylang-Ylang. The formulae include essential-oils of flowers, which is making those perfume emotional booster, by exerting a positive influence on the unconscious. . Gellé Frères realized a significant step by integrating in each of its perfume a microcapsule, capable to faithfully give back the floral smell while extending their lasting. This very innovative technology allows to remove the alcohol, to avoid photosensitization and skin dryness. . . (4) Best MAKEUP award: Wunder2 (UK) Prime & Behold . WUNDER2 PRIME & BEHOLD is a Professional Primer for Color Make-up that locks any color pigment to the skin, intensifies it & ensures it is waterproof, transfer-proof and smudge-proof for up to 24 hours.
