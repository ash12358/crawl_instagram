{Zurich} Honestly, is there anything better than this beautiful city in the summertime?
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/209a0ce2fe2d18bbfea2e9d70310d211/5BCCE139/t51.2885-15/e35/36877382_1541328755972322_3874735824469753856_n.jpg
{Urban Walls} I posted a similar picture a while back and got a lot of questions about our “wallpaper”... Truth is, this fabulous backdrop is made up of high end decals. 👌🏼 This motif warmed up our modern, white home and gave it a charming vibe. In person, this wall looks hand painted...the decals are that good! Check out @urbanwalls to see their options! So many wonderful (and inexpensive) options to add some wow to your home! #NotSponsored #JustLoveThem

{Higher Ground} Taking little steps to a healthier me... More stairs, less elevators ✨

{Nature’s Pool} Lake of Zurich ✨

{National Bikini Day} Goes to show...there’s a day for literally everything 😂🙈

{Views} Certain places retain their beauty no matter how many times you see it... This is definitely one of them. Our favorite trip of the summer is always to Bad Ragaz. ✨

{Parent Life} Stopping at every single carousel is not only mandatory but a great way to relieve your purse of all those heavy coins 😂🙈 #TakeAllMyMoney
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/22b5ca0fa13cbc9d0b513d7571f2fa70/5BCCDE12/t51.2885-15/e35/35999589_1099120430213232_1292721839688122368_n.jpg
{Left Right} When the lighting is just right and you’re not sure which side to chose... You post both 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/02b0dd9bd549f8e111a8170fd4cc10e9/5BEB1F9C/t51.2885-15/e35/35484831_216817992270448_3791943432121876480_n.jpg
{Chill} Unplugging from your everyday life will do wonders for your soul. Whether you go across the ocean, across the country, or simply across the street to a new park/place... Take a trip somewhere and unplug. #LiveLifeBeautifully

{Take A Stand} As our Instagram lives become more and more curated, I’m reminded that our outside world is becoming more and more messy. Take a stand and don’t be afraid to use your voice or, in our case, tiny square for positive change. ✨💗✨💗✨💗

{Nudes} Fact: a nude heel will always make your legs look like they go on for miles... And a short skirt doesn’t hurt either 🔥
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8c7aefe05d3601ad631a877d02f6999f/5BCC1AF9/t51.2885-15/e35/33645824_1111220175695717_6253219302028083200_n.jpg
{Views} Took the world’s steepest cogwheel train yesterday and visited #Pilatus in the Lucerne area. I had been here before but no amount of visits can prepare you for the amazing views. It’s worth the money and time to visit... Just one word of advice, be sure to check the forecast before coming. A sunny, warm day is your best bet. 👌🏼 #ViewFromMySeat
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8b8385a11da64074a99f5f925e8eeea4/5BCCA017/t51.2885-15/e35/33096024_1117950021679714_1687345170011389952_n.jpg
{Hair} Guys, I’m totally missing my long hair. Although I definitely needed a trim, I’m not sure I was mentally prepared for such a cut. I even looked up how fast hair grows...🙈🙈🙈 At its rate, my hair will be this length again next year 😭😭😭 Anyone else have a hard time with hair cuts??!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6958026bc512344c99ad3cf6585df51c/5BD0ED84/t51.2885-15/e35/34117061_1826580867636996_5415330027925405696_n.jpg
{Straight Ahead} Took the high road (see what I did there) while crossing the suspension bridge at Sattel, Switzerland. I really enjoyed the views and watching my hubby panic in fear. 😂 Who knew?!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dc4da533a9c9aa60b6b769314b749428/5BE68E25/t51.2885-15/e35/33419849_500002040415141_8762800222435803136_n.jpg
{Summer Whites} Actually, I think we can pretty much get rid of that term...don’t you agree? Wear what you want when you want and you’ll always be in style. ✨👌🏼
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5209f6a5595b38ab2f1e941c11712994/5BE3617A/t51.2885-15/e35/33567673_237043350397122_6256578404540219392_n.jpg
{Cat Herder} Just another name for Mom 😂 Getting these two to sit for a picture (at the same time) has become my summer goal. Let’s see how we’re doing come August 🙈

{Passé} Never. Ivo and I have over 35 trips combined to this magical city...and I assure you, this view does not get old. It will take your breath away every time. Paris, merci pour la belle semaine. Nous reviendrons!
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/36f2ae8f9f0d688838dab3ebdd945a78/5BC765C8/t51.2885-15/e35/32813508_222498751681671_2041418077710581760_n.jpg
{Full Circle} Ivo and I got married here and and have countless trips to this beautiful city. We came here with Mia when she was under 2 and she (obviously) doesn’t remember much... But now, now it’s a whole new ball game. So happy and excited to share all our spots and memories with our children...and hopefully begin new traditions for us as a family. Paris has always had a place in my heart and now even more. 💗💗

{To The Max} These kids have been so happy since we got here. It’s such a wonderful change of pace, scenery, and life. Our Swiss summer is off to a fabulous start! Follow us on my InstaStory!

{Rain or Shine} Left a muggy and dreary Miami for a beautifully sunny and warm Zurich... The perfect way to start our summer. Hope summer has arrived whenever you are! #MemorialDayWeekend #flyswiss

{Pack It Up} I’m always overwhelmed when it comes to packing for our summer trip. It’s never easy, I always overpacked, and surprisingly (or not), I come back home with more than what I left with 🙈 At least my kids’ suitcase is done...now if I could just finish mine...
https://scontent-sit4-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d545a7be75f303d10a99047286b0cdf1/5BCEE58A/t51.2885-15/e35/32247568_446938132393371_165350215056883712_n.jpg
{Amour} Still obsessing over this weekend’s #RoyalWedding. Obviously there was something super special about it all but what I loved most was the sermon from Bishop Michael Curry. If you haven’t read or heard it, I encourage to do so. It was beautiful and full of important reminders about love, its power, its significance, and its necessity in our days. Love is the way.

{Smile, You Got This} T-minus 7 days before we leave for two and a half months 🙈 Slight anxiety as I haven’t started packing and still have so much on the “to-do” list. Send me good vibes and coffee. Lots of coffee 😂

{You Know You’re A Mom When} Your daughter’s hair is perfect and yours is a mess 😂 Your son’s shirt is crisply pressed and your dress is wrinkly 🙈 Your Birkin bag sits in your closet collecting dust while you carry around a backpack 😅 Your heels have morphed into kittens and Stans 😳 You watch the “Academy Awards” and only know the movies in the animated category 🎥 You can name more Princesses and Superhero’s than current political figures 🤣 Your idea of a perfect date is you, solo, in silence, with a good book 📖 You wonder if Navy Seal training was developed by a mom because #teamnosleep is life. You wish for perks of the pre-kids life but truly can’t imagine your life without your kids 💕 Happy Mother’s Day, beautiful, gorgeous, tired, hardworking, glue of the family, organizing mamas!!! May you be cherished and loved today and everyday! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗

{Pool Day} Back on my ginger ale, Johnnie Walker Red, and crushed ice kick. I gotta admit, that crushed ice at the end of the drink is my fave. It holds all the flavors and adds some crunch. Love love love it! #ad #JohnnieWalker #KeepWalkingAmerica

{Oh Baby} Fact: I love baby showers. It’s always a great way to make the mother to be feel extra special, her child feel loved, and for friends to get together. Today was no exception. The #OGMiamiBloggers crew was in full force celebrating the beautiful @nany and her soon to be born baby boy. We ate, drank (probably more than we should have), and were ridiculously merry. Good friends and good wine will do that to you 👌🏼✨ Special thanks to @kellysaks and @itsmeerikat for organizing! Everything was perfection! And thanks to @quintolahuella for feeding us. The food was beyond! What a way to spend a Saturday! ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

{The Flow} Got to tour the fab space that is @miansai headquarters last week and ended up with this gorgeous Reeve cuff. It fits right in with my arm candy family. Fun fact; I have worn my engagement ring and my evil eye bracelet every day for the last 11 years. Every. Single. Day. When I love something...I really LOVE something.

{Hello, 39} Celebrating my birthday today with a lot of pride, happiness, and love. I’m always surprised when people don’t want to tell others their age. Why? Your age doesn’t define you. It doesn’t take away from all the amazing things you are. It simply reminds you of how lucky you are to have lived so many years. Count your blessings. Change your life. Thank you all for being part of my journey! #ThisIs39

{Crossing Over} 2017, I can’t complain about you but I can always hope for better. Better ways to grow. Better ways to mother. Better ways to work. Better ways to simply be a better me. Wishing you all a wonderful start to 2018! Can’t wait to see the amazing things life has in store for all of us! ✨

{Favorite Gifts} Fact: the hubby and I didn’t get anything for each other this year 🙈 The truth is, as cheesy as it sounds, we simply have everything we need and want. From our new home, to new family vacations, to celebrating 10 years of marriage... We’ve been beyond blessed this year. And frankly, no store bought gift could top the joy that these two babes bring. Merry Christmas indeed! 🎄❤️

{Back} After two weeks away, the hubby is back!!! I’m thankful to have him home and an extra pair of hands with these two wild things 😜 But I’m so proud of these babes (and myself) for how well we do alone. My kids are kids...trying, sometimes defiant, emotional, and just a tiny bit (okay a lot) whiny...but they make me laugh, they remind me to take my time, they shift my perspective in EVERYTHING, and they truly fill my days with love. Exhausted love, but true, pure love. Happy Halloween, my little goblins. Thanks for the beautiful (and silly) times we had these past two weeks. Now back to our regular programming 😂✨💕

{Thinking} It’s been a while since I posted but to be perfectly honest, posting felt a little trivial with all the stuff going on in the world... From our backyards, to neighboring lands, to islands, and more. I’m feeling the “static” of these things and have felt pretty uninspired lately. I’ve mostly felt worried and a bit helpless. Constantly wondering what more can I do? Turns out the most I can do is to keep being me. To keep mothering my children and teach them about love, compassion, respect for our planet, for each other. To keep spreading positivity with my smile or with a kind gesture. To keep moving forward because that’s the only way change happens. And lastly, to keep praying ❤️

{Here, There, Everywhere} Fact: I never for one second thought about the things we left behind when we evacuated... All my thoughts were consumed with the things we left with; two small children and one very frightened 16 year old Chihuahua. Those things were our home. Nothing else. Grateful to bring our home back here. Miami, we love you. ❤️✨

{Keep Moving} Nothing says "getting back into the swing of things" like hosting a baby shower, two dinner parties, and one back to school play date during our first week back. 😜

{Too Cool} And headed for school! Can't believe this little "baby" of mine will be in a big girl school come fall. Time flies when you're a parent. Everyone told me it would....(sigh)

{Going Places} I've been nonstop this summer with the babes, taking them to new places as much as possible. It's work, but it's worth it.

{Be Real} A little rant with (hopefully) a lot of truth. Instagram is a fabulous place where we can share beautifully curated pictures of the things we love, that move us, style us, and change us. But it's also a place of deceit, jealousy, and emptiness. Don't get swayed by the bad. Keep your pictures/posts real. Let them speak about who you are, love, see, do. Not about how you wish to look, what you pretend to have, or worse, who you pretend to be. Just keep it real. ✨💕

{Mia & Alexander} The two reasons why I get to wake up today and get spoiled and pampered. ✨💕 Love these babes of mine...and their many faces. Mia's face in this picture is the face I make when the hubby says "I got you a gift card." 😂😜 Twinsies! Happy Mother's Day, mamas!

{Tu y Yo} Spent the morning with Mia and her classmates at a Mother's Day brunch. Her gift to me was a song and a rose...which, of course, brought me to tears. Being a mom will turn you into the biggest sap...and you'll totally be okay with it. 😭😭😭 Happy Early Mother's Day to all the fabulous, wonderful people that wear this title proudly and lovingly. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
